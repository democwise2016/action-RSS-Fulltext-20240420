<p>If you own Google’s flagship TV Streamer, it’s time to check for an update, but you might want to temper your expectations. A new software build is now rolling out, but after a five-month wait for a new release, this latest update delivers a security patch that is already more than two months out of date.</p>
<p>Since its <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/say-hello-to-the-google-tv-streamer-a-99-entertainment-and-smart-home-hub/" target="_blank">launch last year,</a> the Google TV Streamer had been on a decent update cadence, with its security patch level staying reasonably current. But that pattern has now been broken. This new update, build number <strong>UTTK.250729.004,</strong> brings with it the <strong>August 2025 security patch.</strong> While any update is welcome, receiving an August patch in mid-October is definitely a bit disappointing.</p><div>

<p>Google Search is the company’s most important and widely used product, and even small visual changes can have a big impact on the user experience. In <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/google-search-sponsored-results-label/" target="_blank">a new blog post, </a>Google has announced an update to how it displays ads on the search results page, introducing a clearer label and, more importantly, <strong>a new control that gives users the power to hide them completely.</strong></p>
<p>The most visible change is how text ads are grouped. Instead of individual labels, all ad results will now be collected under a single, larger <strong>“Sponsored results”</strong> header. Google says this new label is designed to be more prominent and will remain visible as you scroll, making it clearer which results are paid advertisements. This new group label will also apply to other ad units, like Shopping ads. It’s important to note that the size and number of ads aren’t changing—Google says the goal here is simply to improve clarity and navigation.</p><div>

<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/Cluster_ScrollInteract_v2.mp4"></video><figcaption>New “Hide sponsored results” button in Google Search</figcaption>
<p>Perhaps the more exciting part of this announcement, however, is the addition of a new user control: a <strong>“Hide sponsored results”</strong> button. With a single click, you will be able to completely collapse the entire text ad section, allowing you to focus solely on the organic search results. This is a fantastic and very welcome addition that gives users an easy, built-in way to temporarily hide ads, which is a huge win for user control and experience.</p>
<p>According to Google, these updates are currently rolling out globally on both desktop and mobile, so you should start seeing the new design in your own search results very soon.</p><div>

      <![CDATA[<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/chromeunboxed.com-ef6a52f99c.webp">
<p>Now that the dust has settled from <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/its-official-google-says-the-android-and-chromeos-merger-is-coming-next-year/" target="_blank">the announcements at last month’s Snapdragon Summit,</a> we’re left with two solid facts: the Android and ChromeOS merger is real, and it’s coming next year. But beneath those confirmations lies a massive, convoluted branding problem that Google now has to solve. For over a decade, Google has branded both the hardware (“Chromebook”) and the software (“ChromeOS”), but I think that with this fundamental platform shift, that entire structure has to change.</p>
<p>Now, I recognize that it’s early and this might all be a bit too soon to speculate. And to be perfectly clear, I don’t have any inside information here.

<h2><strong>Why ‘ChromeOS’ and ‘Chromebook’ have to go</strong></h2>
<p>To understand the problem, we just need to look at how Apple and Microsoft handle their ecosystems. Apple is vertically integrated; they make the hardware and the software, so a single “MacBook” brand running “macOS” is simple. Microsoft, on the other hand, makes the Windows software platform for a huge variety of hardware partners like Dell, HP, and Lenovo, while also making its own first-party “Surface” line.</p>
<p>Google currently finds itself more in the Microsoft camp here. And in this new world of Android and ChromeOS merging, the names “ChromeOS” and “Chromebook” are no longer accurate. The new OS isn’t <em>based</em> on Chrome; Chrome will simply be a very important app running on an Android foundation. I think keeping the “ChromeOS” name would be misleading and would do nothing to shed the “just a browser” stigma the platform has fought for years.</p><div>

<p>The same is true for the “Chromebook” hardware brand. If Google forced all of its partners—Lenovo, HP, Acer, etc.—to call their new devices “Chromebooks,” it would be the equivalent of Microsoft forcing every PC maker to call their laptops a “Surface.” It just doesn’t make a ton of sense with this new merged OS.</p>
<h2><strong>So, what will the new OS be called?</strong></h2>
<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/chromeunboxed.com-997f26b5a3.webp">
<p>From my perspective, the answer is right in front of us: <strong>Android.</strong> It’s the core of everything Google does. Just as we have Android TV and Android Auto, the most logical name for this new platform would simply be <strong>Android.</strong> It’s clear, descriptive, and leverages Google’s most powerful brand.</p>
<p>Our Chrome Unboxed Plus community had some fun with this, throwing out names like GeminiOS and SparkOS, but the simple, established “Android” branding feels like the most likely path forward.</p><div>

<h2><strong>What </strong>w<strong>ill the laptops be called?</strong></h2>
<p>This is where the Microsoft model really comes into play. Google doesn’t <em>have</em> to brand the third-party hardware at all in this new world. Manufacturers will simply build and brand their own laptops—the Lenovo Duet, the Samsung Galaxy Book—and they will be marketed as being <strong>“powered by Android.”</strong> This is exactly how the Android phone, tablet, and watch markets already operate.</p>
<p>This then clears the path for Google to launch its own flagship hardware to showcase the new OS. And all signs point to this happening. We’ve been tracking a <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/a-new-chromebook-tablet-sapphire-just-appeared-with-a-decidedly-made-by-google-feature/" target="_blank">new tablet that will likely be in the Made by Google family, codenamed Sapphire,</a> that features a lightbar reminiscent of the 2013 and 2015 Chromebook Pixels. </p>
<p>This feels like the first in a new line of premium, first-party devices. Hopefully, this means the return of the Pixel Tablet, now with the new OS, and/or the launch of a <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/leaked-pixel-laptop-lends-credence-to-chromebooks-moving-to-android/" target="_blank">Pixel Laptop, which has also been rumored.</a> The biggest benefit here is that these devices would finally be back in the main “Made by Google” portfolio, hopefully receiving the broader marketing budgets and promotion they deserve.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2><strong>The long transitio</strong>n</h2>
<p>Of course, we still have to consider the tens of millions of Chromebooks out there right now in the enterprise and education markets that Google is contractually obligated to continue supporting; they won’t just disappear. We fully expect that the existing devices that can’t handle the new OS will continue to receive security and feature updates on the legacy ChromeOS for the remainder of their 10-year support window.</p>
<p>My bet is that we are about to enter a new era of powerful, diverse laptops from all our favorite manufacturers, all likely being “powered by Android.” I don’t envy Google’s task of rearranging and marketing all of this, but it’s a necessary and exciting step!

<p>We’ve all been there. You get a last-minute calendar notification for a video call you weren’t quite ready for, and you wish you had a few more moments to look a bit more polished and presentable. Last year, Google introduced the “Touch-up” feature in Meet to help with this, but a new update is taking things to a whole new, AI-powered level. In a fun and surprisingly practical new update, <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/10/ai-powered-makeup-in-google-meet.html" target="_blank">Google is expanding this feature</a> with the addition of <strong>AI-powered makeup</strong> directly within Google Meet.</p>
<h2>From polished to expressive, all in one click</h2>
<p>This new feature gives you a range of <strong>12 new studio makeup looks</strong> to choose from. The options run the gamut from a subtle, polished, professional touch to a more expressive flair, giving you a quick way to enhance your appearance to match the tone of any meeting.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>The most impressive part is the AI behind it. Google has trained the model to ensure your chosen look remains <strong>seamless and untouched,</strong> even through everyday movements like sipping your coffee or touching your face. It intelligently maps to your unique features and moves with you, so it looks natural and not like a static filter.</p>
<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/blogger.googleusercontent.com-d59b564b68.gif">
<h2>How to get it and how it works</h2>
<p>The new AI-powered makeup options are available in the same appearance panel as the existing Touch-up feature on both <strong>web and mobile.</strong> The feature will be <strong>off by default,</strong> so you’ll need to enable it yourself when you want to use it. Once you choose a look, your preference will be saved for your next meeting, so you don’t have to re-apply it every time.</p><div>
<h2>Featured Videos</h2>
</div>
<div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>The feature is part of a gradual rollout that began on October 8th and is available to a wide range of users, including most paid <strong>Google Workspace</strong> plans (like Business Standard/Plus and Enterprise), as well as <strong>Google One</strong> and <strong>Google Workspace Individual</strong> subscribers.</p>
<p>While it might sound a bit like a gimmick at first, this is an incredibly practical feature for the modern, remote-work world. It’s a quick, easy confidence booster for those unexpected calls, and another great example of Google using its AI to solve everyday problems.</p>

<p>We’ve all been there. You get a last-minute calendar notification for a video call you weren’t quite ready for, and you wish you had a few more moments to look a bit more polished and presentable. Last year, Google introduced the “Touch-up” feature in Meet to help with this, but a new update is taking things to a whole new, AI-powered level. In a fun and surprisingly practical new update, <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/10/ai-powered-makeup-in-google-meet.html" target="_blank">Google is expanding this feature</a> with the addition of <strong>AI-powered makeup</strong> directly within Google Meet.</p>
<h2>From polished to expressive, all in one click</h2>
<p>This new feature gives you a range of <strong>12 new studio makeup looks</strong> to choose from. The options run the gamut from a subtle, polished, professional touch to a more expressive flair, giving you a quick way to enhance your appearance to match the tone of any meeting.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>The most impressive part is the AI behind it. Google has trained the model to ensure your chosen look remains <strong>seamless and untouched,</strong> even through everyday movements like sipping your coffee or touching your face. It intelligently maps to your unique features and moves with you, so it looks natural and not like a static filter.</p>
<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/blogger.googleusercontent.com-d59b564b68.gif">
<h2>How to get it and how it works</h2>
<p>The new AI-powered makeup options are available in the same appearance panel as the existing Touch-up feature on both <strong>web and mobile.</strong> The feature will be <strong>off by default,</strong> so you’ll need to enable it yourself when you want to use it. Once you choose a look, your preference will be saved for your next meeting, so you don’t have to re-apply it every time.</p><div>

</div>
<p>The feature is part of a gradual rollout that began on October 8th and is available to a wide range of users, including most paid <strong>Google Workspace</strong> plans (like Business Standard/Plus and Enterprise), as well as <strong>Google One</strong> and <strong>Google Workspace Individual</strong> subscribers.</p>
<p>While it might sound a bit like a gimmick at first, this is an incredibly practical feature for the modern, remote-work world. It’s a quick, easy confidence booster for those unexpected calls, and another great example of Google using its AI to solve everyday problems.</p>

<p>In a massive (and frankly awesome) move to equip the next generation with foundational AI skills, <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/bringing-the-best-ai-to-university-students-in-europe-the-middle-east-and-africa-at-no-cost/" target="_blank">Google has just announced</a> an incredible new offer for university students. The company is making its most advanced AI tools available to students in <strong>Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, completely free of charge for one year.</strong> This isn’t just access to the basic Gemini model; this is a full, no-cost <strong>12-month Google AI Pro Plan,</strong> and it’s packed with the best and most capable tools Google has to offer.</p>
<h2>What’s included in the free AI Pro Plan</h2>
<p>This is the real deal. Students who sign up will get a full year of access to the entire premium AI suite, which includes:</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access to Gemini 2.5 Pro:</strong> This is Google’s most capable model, perfect for getting help with homework, writing papers, and asking complex questions.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Research:</strong> A powerful tool that can save you hours by creating custom, in-depth research reports from hundreds of different web sources.</li>
<li><strong>NotebookLM:</strong> Our favorite AI thinking companion that helps you organize your thoughts and make connections across all your source materials.</li>
<li><strong>Veo 3 &amp; Nano Banana:</strong> Access to Google’s state-of-the-art video and image generation models, allowing you to transform text and photos into unique creative assets.</li>

</ul>
<h2>More than just an answer, it’s a learning companion</h2>
<p>Google is also emphasizing that these tools are designed to be more than just answer engines. The AI Pro Plan includes access to <strong>Guided Learning,</strong> a new mode in Gemini that acts as a personal learning companion. Instead of just giving you the answer, it guides you with questions and step-by-step support to help you work through complex problems, structure arguments, and build a deeper understanding of a subject.</p>

<p>This is a fantastic opportunity for students in those regions to get hands-on experience with some of the most powerful AI tools on the planet.

<p>There are certain Chromebooks that sit in a class all their own, and the <strong>ASUS ExpertBook CX54 Chromebook Plus</strong> is undoubtedly one of them. It’s one of the most powerful, well-built, and feature-packed Chromebooks you can buy, period. A couple of months ago, we were blown away to see it drop to just $649, and if you missed out on that sale, we have some fantastic news: <strong>a very similar deal is back.</strong></p>
<p>Right now, Best Buy has once again dropped the price of this absolute monster of a Chromebook <strong>down to just $679, and there are few Chromebooks ever made that can even come close to matching all the good stuff you get in this device.</strong></p><div>

<p>If you’re looking for a truly no-compromise Chromebook experience, the CX54 is where it’s at. This is the top-spec version with all the extras, including the brilliant touchscreen, a massive <strong>16GB of RAM,</strong> and a spacious <strong>256GB of fast NVMe storage.</strong> The list of premium features is long:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Screen:</strong> It all starts with the gorgeous 14-inch, 16:10 QHD display that is incredibly bright at <strong>500 nits</strong> and buttery-smooth thanks to its <strong>120Hz refresh rate.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Build:</strong> You get a sleek, all-metal chassis that feels incredibly premium, along with a fast and accurate fingerprint scanner for easy logins.</li>
<li><strong>The Inputs:</strong> The backlit keyboard is fantastic to type on, and the smooth glass trackpad is a joy to use.</li>
<li><strong>The Power:</strong> Under the hood, a fast <strong>Intel Core Ultra 5 processor</strong> paired with that 16GB of RAM means this Chromebook will handle any workflow you can throw at it for years to come without breaking a sweat.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are certain Chromebooks that sit in a class all their own, and the <strong>ASUS ExpertBook CX54 Chromebook Plus</strong> is undoubtedly one of them. It’s one of the most powerful, well-built, and feature-packed Chromebooks you can buy, period. A couple of months ago, we were blown away to see it drop to just $649, and if you missed out on that sale, we have some fantastic news: <strong>a very similar deal is back.</strong></p>
<p>Right now, Best Buy has once again dropped the price of this absolute monster of a Chromebook <strong>down to just $679, and there are few Chromebooks ever made that can even come close to matching all the good stuff you get in this device.</strong></p><div>

<h4>ASUS ExpertBook CX54 Chromebook Plus (8GB $599.99 | 16GB $679)</h4>
<p><span>SAVE $150</span></p>
<p>The ASUS ExpertBook CX54 Chromebook Plus is easily one of the best Chromebooks ever made. It has a few things I’d correct if I’m splitting hairs, but overall, you can’t find a better-built Chromebook with the speed, display (500 nits), keyboard, trackpad and fingerprint scanner on offer with this one. ASUS pulled out the stops, and this is a wildly-impressive Chromebook through and through.  <strong>And now, there’s a version with double the memory and storage, and it’s on sale too!</strong></p>

</div>
<p>Of all the new Chromebook Plus models launched in 2024, the 516 GE from Acer is still my absolute favorite. Building off the first generation of this excellent overall Chromebook, Acer has subtly tweaked the keyboard, the RGB backlighting, the speakers and the internals to make an amazing Chromebook even better.</p>

<h4>Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11″ (8GB w/Pen $279.99)</h4>
<p><span>SAVE $120</span></p>
<p>The latest Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11″ is the best tablet in the lineup yet! While keeping much of what made the Duet 3 amazing, the new Duet adds a unique kickstand for both landscape and portrait viewing, an improved MediaTek Kompanio 838 SoC, 8GB of RAM (on some models), an improved magnetic slot for the pen (included with some models), and massively improved cameras.</p>

</div>
<p>With easily the most enticing exterior of all the new Chromebook Plus models, the ASUS CX34 had a great balance of style, functionality and affordability. With this updated model for 2024, you get the same 14-inch IPS display, white exterior, generous trackpad, comfy keyboard, but the internals get a bump up to the Intel Core i5-1335U and touch is added to the screen as well.  It’s a hefty update to an already-great device, and now it’s on sale, too!</p>

<h4>ASUS Chromebook Plus CX14 ($299)</h4>
<p><span>SAVE $130</span></p>
<p>The new ASUS Chromebook Plus CX14 is the company’s latest entry into the Chromebook Plus ecosystem, and it comes packing an Intel Core 3 Series 1 processor, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a 1080p screen, and plenty of ports packed into a 3-pound chassis.  We’ve not had our hands on this one just yet, but it looks like a compelling, affordable Chromebook Plus package when it’s on sale like this!</p><div>

<p>The Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus is&nbsp;convertible, USI compatible, and comes with the latest Intel Core i3-1315U.&nbsp;With the Chromebook Plus-required 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage, this Chromebook is plenty fast and easy on the eyes, too. The 14-inch 16:10 1920×1200 IPS screen is sharp, colorful, and bright at 300 nits. With upward-firing speakers, the overall package<strong> </strong>– like it is on most of these Chromebook Plus models so far – is quite good.</p>

<h4>Lenovo Gaming Chromebook ($349.99)</h4>
<p><span>SAVE $150</span></p>
<p>The Lenovo Gaming Chromebook is a device that I’d wager many of you forgot about.  Released at the same time as the very-popular Acer 516 GE, this device actually comes with a lot of the same upsides.  It has an RGB keyboard, the same bright 16-inch QHD 16:10 screen, and fast internals.  This particular model has the 12th-gen Core i3-1215U, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, making it Chromebook Plus eligible and a ridiculous deal right now.</p>

<h4>Lenovo Flex 3i Chromebook ($299.99)</h4>
<p><span>SAVE $130</span></p>
<p>This little device has been on the radar for almost a year, and it is still impressing me to this day. Lenovo has made a Flex 3 Chromebook for many years, but <strong>there’s something special about this one.</strong> With a far higher attention to detail, better build quality and a knockout 16:10 FHD screen for this price point, the Lenovo Flex 3i is already a great purchase at full price, but it’s wildly discounted right now!</p>

<h4>Lenovo Slim 3i Chromebook Plus ($429.99)</h4>
<p><span>SAVE $120</span></p>
<p>From the exceedingly firm chassis to the surprisingly-good 14-inch IPS touchscreen, the Slim 3i nails nearly every part of the Chromebook experience in a way that few other devices manage to pull off. With a stellar backlit keyboard, solid trackpad, quick internals (Intel Core i3-N305, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD), punchy/vibrant screen (300 nits), and top-notch build quality, I’ve enjoyed using this Chromebook more than nearly any other device I’ve ever tested. </p>

<p>The Lenovo Slim 3 Chromebook is one of my favorite affordable Chromebooks of 2023. With a superb build quality (despite being all plastic) and a shockingly great screen at this price point, the Slim 3 feels far nicer than its price tag the moment you open the lid.</p>

<h4>ASUS Chromebook CM30 Detachable (4GB $208.99)</h4>

<p>ASUS has issued an impressive update to its first attempt at a ChromeOS tablet. The CM30 Detachable improves on the keyboard, the kickstand, build quality and speed over its predecessor. While the Kompanio 520 inside isn’t a powerhouse, it gets by quite well and there’s also a model that comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage as well.</p>

<p>Of all the new Chromebook Plus models launched in 2024, the 516 GE from Acer is still my absolute favorite.

<p><a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/how-to-be-a-smart-black-friday-chromebook-deal-shopper/">I wrote a buying guide of sorts on wading through the rough waters of good and bad deals on new and old devices,</a> and if you don’t find what you are looking for on any given day, I’d recommend giving that a read so you can go and make your own decisions across multiple retailers.  </p>
<p><strong>But for those of you who simply want the best deals on any given day in one place that is easy to see, understand, and digest, this will be your spot.</strong> Bookmark it for later and be sure to make this a priority spot to visit down the road when the time comes to shop for the right Chromebook at the right price. <strong><em>Also, unless otherwise noted, the listings that are manufacturer refurbished come with all original accessories, are free of any cosmetic blemishes, and carry a 90-day manufacturer warranty.</em></strong></p><div>

<p>We’ve talked extensively about the fantastic value that Walmart’s Onn Google TV streaming devices offer. From the powerful Onn 4K Pro to the new 4K Plus, these budget-friendly streamers have truly nailed it, delivering a premium Google TV experience for a fraction of the price. But what if you still want the device that comes directly from Google, with all the bells and whistles? Good news: Google’s flagship 4K TV Streamer is now <a href="https://walmrt.us/4iw266c" target="_blank">on sale for just <strong>$79.99 at Walmart.</strong></a></p>
<p>This $20 discount brings it significantly closer to the Onn devices and makes it a much more palatable option for those who want the “Made by Google” experience.</p><div>

<p>One of the big differentiators is the deeper Google Home integration, and this is where Google’s own device truly shines.

<p>And then there’s the design. Let’s be honest, if your streamer is going to be out on a shelf and visible, the Google TV Streamer strikes a far more attractive and aesthetically pleasing pose than the more utilitarian Onn boxes.

<p>While it may require a separate HDMI cable (a minor quibble), the Google TV Streamer still delivers a more refined and premium experience overall. If you’re looking for the absolute best Google TV experience directly from the source, and want those deeper smart home ties and a sleeker design, this sale makes it a compelling choice.</p>

<p>We’ve talked extensively about the fantastic value that Walmart’s Onn Google TV streaming devices offer.

<p>For those of us who have truly embraced the foldable form factor, the arrival of a new Pixel Fold is always an interesting occasion. After spending considerable time with Samsung’s Z Fold series over the past few years, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for having a phone that transforms into a tablet in your pocket. Today, we’re taking a first look at the <strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold,</strong> and from the get-go, it’s clear Google has refined an already-excellent design.</p>
<h2>First impressions: thin and gorgeous</h2>
<p>Right away, the new Moonstone color of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold stands out. It’s a beautiful, elegant colorway that looks fantastic. The device is impressively thin, though it doesn’t exactly rival Samsung’s latest Z Fold 7.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>When closed, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is remarkably similar in size and feel to a standard smartphone, specifically the Pixel 10 Pro. This means you get a usable, comfortable outer screen that doesn’t feel cramped, allowing you to use it as a regular phone without needing to constantly open it up.</p>

</div>
<h2>The screens: a wider view and less-visible crease</h2>
<p>Opening the device reveals a spacious inner display that offers an almost-square aspect ratio. This provides significantly more screen real estate than the taller, thinner inner displays of Samsung’s prior foldables (not the Z Fold 7), making it excellent for content consumption and multitasking. Both the inner and outer displays are 120Hz OLED panels, ensuring a buttery-smooth experience with deep blacks and punchy colors.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>But an impressive improvement is the relative shallowness of the <strong>screen crease.</strong> When looking at the Pixel 10 Pro Fold head-on with the screen on, <strong>the crease is impressively less visible than what I use daily on my Z Fold 5.</strong> Even in the worst possible lighting conditions (screen off, direct light shining on it), the crease is dramatically less discernible than on previous generations and competing devices. Google has truly outdone itself with the new gearless hinge mechanism and internal display, making the crease much less of an issue for everyday use.</p>
<h2>Tensor G5 and some similar cameras</h2>
<p>Under the hood, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is powered by the new <strong>Tensor G5 chip</strong> and comes with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, so performance should be solid.  While the GPU isn’t what you want if you are really into games, those who use their phones for all other tasks should be satisfied.</p>
<p>The camera system is a triple rear setup with a 48MP wide lens, a 10.5MP ultrawide with macro focus, and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto lens. While the megapixel count isn’t quite as high as the Pixel 10 Pro or Pro XL, it’s still a “Pixel” camera, meaning you can expect solid photos thanks to Google’s renowned software processing.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>In the box, you’ll find the usual minimal fare: a charging cable and documentation. Interestingly, unlike other Pixel 10 phones, the Fold <em>does</em> retain a physical SIM card slot alongside eSIM support.</p>
<p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold feels like more mature, polished foldable. For those who want the best of both a phone and a large-screen tablet in one pocketable device, combined with Pixel’s excellent cameras and software, this could very well be your next phone. How it actually stands up to far stiffer competition from Samsung this time around, it’s unclear how it will fare head-to-head, but Google has done a good job once again building a gorgeous foldable that fully delivers the Pixel experience in a much larger form factor.</p>

While the megapixel count isn’t quite as high as the Pixel 10 Pro or Pro XL, it’s still a “Pixel” camera, meaning you can expect solid photos thanks to Google’s renowned software processing.</p><div>

<p>In the box, you’ll find the usual minimal fare: a charging cable and documentation. Interestingly, unlike other Pixel 10 phones, the Fold <em>does</em> retain a physical SIM card slot alongside eSIM support.</p>
<p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold feels like more mature, polished foldable. For those who want the best of both a phone and a large-screen tablet in one pocketable device, combined with Pixel’s excellent cameras and software, this could very well be your next phone. How it actually stands up to far stiffer competition from Samsung this time around, it’s unclear how it will fare head-to-head, but Google has done a good job once again building a gorgeous foldable that fully delivers the Pixel experience in a much larger form factor.</p>

<p>In terms of current social media trends, vertical video is king. But since its launch, Google’s simple and powerful video creation tool, Google Vids, has had one major limitation: <strong>it was built exclusively for traditional, widescreen (16:9) videos.</strong> This made it a non-starter for anyone looking to create content for platforms like YouTube Shorts or Instagram Reels.</p>
<p>That limitation is now a thing of the past. In a much-needed update, <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/10/vertical-square-videos-google-vids.html" target="_blank">Google has announced</a> that it is now rolling out support for creating and editing videos in both <strong>vertical (9:16) and square (1:1) formats.</strong></p><div>

<p>This is a simple but essential update that gives creators far more flexibility to build content tailored for the platforms where people spend most of their time. Whether you’re making a quick video for YouTube Shorts, an Instagram Reel, or a TikTok, you can now build it from start to finish right within Google Vids. To make the process even easier, Google also announced that <strong>vertical and square templates</strong> will be coming soon.</p>
<p>The best part about this update is that it’s for everyone. This isn’t a premium, paid feature; it’s rolling out to <strong>all Google Workspace customers, Workspace Individual Subscribers, and users with personal Google accounts.</strong></p><div>

<p>When Google first announced that the Pixel Watch 4 was designed to be serviceable, we were optimistic but cautious. After all, “repairable” can mean a lot of things. But after an incredibly detailed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pQWBFBIU2U" target="_blank">new video teardown from the experts at <strong>iFixit,</strong></a> it’s official: Google didn’t just make a repairable smartwatch; they’ve set a new gold standard for the entire industry, earning a stunning <strong>9 out of 10 on the repairability scale.</strong></p>
<p>When <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/the-pixel-watch-4-is-finally-repairable-and-thats-a-huge-deal/">we first wrote about this,</a> the news was a huge deal in and of itself. But seeing the actual teardown process confirms that this isn’t just marketing speak—it’s a fundamental shift in product design.</p><div>

</div>
<p>So, how did Google create the most repairable smartwatch on the market? The secret is surprisingly simple: <strong>they used screws and gaskets instead of a mountain of adhesive.</strong> As the iFixit teardown shows, a pair of T2 screws hidden under the band lugs actuates a clever hinged mechanism that holds the back panel in place. Tiny O-ring gaskets provide the water resistance, not a layer of sticky, hard-to-remove glue.</p>
<p>This thoughtful, serviceable design extends throughout the entire device. The battery, now encased in a protective metal container, is held in by just a few more screws. The display is the same story, sealed with another O-ring in a mechanism iFixit likens to a mechanical watch. In all, you only need a few common screwdriver bits, a spudger, and a pair of tweezers to perform the most common repairs.</p><div>

</div>
<p>This isn’t just a minor improvement; it’s a complete reimagining of how a compact, water-resistant wearable can be constructed. For years, the assumption has been that you had to sacrifice repairability for a sleek, sealed design. <strong>Google has proven that doesn’t have to be the case.</strong></p>
<p>So, what does a 9/10 score mean for all of you who have already purchased this watch or are thinking about buying it? Well, it means that when your battery inevitably starts to fade in a few years, you won’t be forced to just get a new watch; instead, you’ll be looking at a simple, accessible battery swap. It transforms the Pixel Watch 4 from a disposable piece of tech into a long-term investment, which is a massive win for consumers and a huge step forward for sustainability.</p>
<p>While official parts aren’t available on iFixit just yet, <a href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14725410?sjid=14020469739181437412-NA#:~:text=Pixel%20Watch-,Pixel%20Watch%204,-Repair%20manual%20(41mm">Google has already published the official service manuals.</a> It’s reassuring to know that when the day comes for a repair, the Pixel Watch 4 is more than ready!</p><div>

In all, you only need a few common screwdriver bits, a spudger, and a pair of tweezers to perform the most common repairs.</p><div>

<p>This isn’t just a minor improvement; it’s a complete reimagining of how a compact, water-resistant wearable can be constructed. For years, the assumption has been that you had to sacrifice repairability for a sleek, sealed design. <strong>Google has proven that doesn’t have to be the case.</strong></p>
<p>So, what does a 9/10 score mean for all of you who have already purchased this watch or are thinking about buying it? Well, it means that when your battery inevitably starts to fade in a few years, you won’t be forced to just get a new watch; instead, you’ll be looking at a simple, accessible battery swap. It transforms the Pixel Watch 4 from a disposable piece of tech into a long-term investment, which is a massive win for consumers and a huge step forward for sustainability.</p>
<p>While official parts aren’t available on iFixit just yet, <a href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14725410?sjid=14020469739181437412-NA#:~:text=Pixel%20Watch-,Pixel%20Watch%204,-Repair%20manual%20(41mm">Google has already published the official service manuals.</a> It’s reassuring to know that when the day comes for a repair, the Pixel Watch 4 is more than ready!</p><div>

<p>In a fantastic new update, Google is rolling out a feature for Chrome that aims to solve the problem of overwhelming website notification overload by <strong>automatically revoking notification permissions for sites you haven’t interacted with recently.</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t just a random new feature; it’s a data-driven solution to a real problem. Google shared that their data indicates <strong>less than 1% of all website notifications receive any interaction from users.</strong> That’s a staggering amount of digital noise for very little benefit if you tend to opt-in for notifications on a regular basis.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>To combat this, Chrome will now intelligently identify sites that you don’t engage with but that send a high volume of notifications, and it will automatically and silently turn off their permission to bug you. This is an extension of the work Chrome’s Safety Check already does for other permissions like your camera and location.</p>
<h2>You are still in control</h2>
<p>If the idea of your browser automatically changing settings makes you a little nervous, don’t worry. Google has built in several important safeguards to ensure you remain in control.</p><div>
<h2>Featured Videos</h2>
</div>
<div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>First and most importantly, this feature will <strong>not revoke notifications for any of your installed web apps (PWAs).</strong> Your important, app-like notifications are safe.</p>
<p>Second, Chrome will <strong>inform you when it removes a permission,</strong> so you’ll never be in the dark. If the browser gets it wrong and revokes a permission you actually wanted to keep, you can easily re-grant it at any time. And if you don’t like the feature at all, you’ll be able to <strong>turn off the auto-revocation feature entirely.</strong></p>
<p>This is a brilliant, “set it and forget it” feature that should lead to a much cleaner and quieter browsing experience for everyone on both desktop and Android. It’s a great step forward in helping users manage online distractions and cut through the noise.</p><div>

<p>When I first unboxed the Logitech Casa Pop-Up Desk over a year and a half ago, I was immediately impressed. I thought it was a brilliant, well-crafted, and thoughtfully designed set of accessories. But if I’m being honest, it didn’t immediately find a permanent place in my daily workflow. At the time, I had a dedicated desk I returned to every day with a full monitor setup, so a portable kit—no matter how clever—felt a bit like a great-but-not-necessary gadget for my specific routine.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and my life and work routine look completely different. And that “nice-to-have” gadget? <strong>It’s now a piece of my everyday carry that I literally never leave home without.</strong></p><div>

<h2>A new, nomadic work life</h2>
<p>Over the six months, my work life has been completely upended. Our co-working office moved, and I launched a new, brick-and-mortar business – <a href="https://proofgolf.com/" target="_blank">Proof Golf</a> – that kept me out of a static office setting for months during the summer months. </p>
<p>Things have settled in a bit, and I’m back at the co-working space on a daily basis.  But even though I come to the same place to work each day, I don’t have a dedicated, permanent desk anymore. I’m still a bit of a nomad on the daily, setting up shop wherever I can land. <strong>And this new reality has made the Logitech Casa an absolute necessity.</strong></p><div>

<h2>The indispensable travel companion</h2>
<p>Having the Casa Pop-Up Desk in my bag makes any temporary space feel workable, comfortable, and productive in a matter of seconds. When I get to the office, a coffee shop, or wherever I’m settling in for the day, the first thing I do is open up and set up Casa. The stand instantly elevates my Chromebook to a more ergonomic level for longer work periods, and the included accessories are awesome.</p>
<p>The <strong>Casa Keys keyboard is simply fantastic to type on,</strong> offering a far more comfortable and tactile experience than most portable keyboards. And the <strong>Casa Touch trackpad,</strong> which had a few minor bugs with multi-finger gestures at launch, now <strong>works flawlessly.</strong> I’ve even settled into a great workflow where I use the large, smooth trackpad for general browsing and navigation, and keep my Logitech Pebble mouse handy for more intensive tasks like graphic design.</p>

<h2>The indispensable travel companion</h2>
<p>Having the Casa Pop-Up Desk in my bag makes any temporary space feel workable, comfortable, and productive in a matter of seconds. When I get to the office, a coffee shop, or wherever I’m settling in for the day, the first thing I do is open up and set up Casa. The stand instantly elevates my Chromebook to a more ergonomic level for longer work periods, and the included accessories are awesome.</p>
<p>The <strong>Casa Keys keyboard is simply fantastic to type on,</strong> offering a far more comfortable and tactile experience than most portable keyboards. And the <strong>Casa Touch trackpad,</strong> which had a few minor bugs with multi-finger gestures at launch, now <strong>works flawlessly.</strong> I’ve even settled into a great workflow where I use the large, smooth trackpad for general browsing and navigation, and keep my Logitech Pebble mouse handy for more intensive tasks like graphic design.</p>

</div>
<p>The Logitech Casa Pop-Up Desk really has gone from a clever accessory into an essential part of my mobile office. For anyone who finds themselves in a similar, non-traditional, nomadic style of work, I can’t recommend it enough. It’s been such a handy, easy-to-carry tool that I won’t be parting with anytime soon.</p><div>

<p>Today, <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/gemini-enterprise-is-googles-new-front-door-for-ai-at-work-and-its-more-than-just-a-chatbot/" target="_blank">Google unveiled <strong>Gemini Enterprise,</strong></a> its ambitious new platform designed to be the “new front door for AI in the workplace.” But what does that actually mean for the average employee? In a new, more detailed post, Google has broken down the four key ways this new AI-powered hub is designed to transform entire workflows and make work easier for everyone.</p>
<h2>1. An AI specialist for every team, no coding required</h2>
<p>The most powerful and democratizing aspect of Gemini Enterprise is its <strong>no-code workbench.</strong> This allows any user—from marketing to finance to HR—to build their own custom AI “agents” to handle their most tedious and time-consuming tasks, without needing to be a developer.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>For example, a marketing manager could ask an agent to generate creative concepts for a new product launch. Because the agent is securely connected to the company’s internal data, it already understands the product’s details and has access to all the approved brand assets. The agent can then generate a variety of high-quality, on-brand campaign ideas, complete with social media copy and visual mockups, in minutes instead of days.</p>
<h2>2. Unlocking and connecting all your business data</h2>
<p>A company’s most valuable information is often trapped in silos—spread across different spreadsheets, applications, and chat threads. Gemini Enterprise is designed to securely connect to all the systems your teams use every day, including <strong>Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and core business applications like Salesforce and SAP.</strong></p><div>
<h2>Featured Videos</h2>
</div>
<div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>This gives the AI agents the deep business context they need to move beyond simple web searches and provide truly intelligent, relevant results that are grounded in your company’s actual data and knowledge.</p>
<h2>3. Automating entire workflows, not just tasks</h2>
<p>The true promise of transformation comes from improving entire processes, not just single steps. By allowing users to combine pre-built, custom, and third-party agents, Gemini Enterprise can orchestrate complex, multi-step workflows across all those different connected systems, automating entire processes on a team’s behalf.</p>
<h2>4. AI that meets you where you work</h2>
<p>Finally, Google emphasizes that the best AI shouldn’t force you to switch contexts; it should meet you where you are. That’s why Gemini Enterprise is designed to work seamlessly across the platforms your teams already rely on, including both <strong>Google Workspace and Microsoft 365.</strong> This deep integration is where you’ll see multi-modal agents that can understand and create text, images, and video directly within the apps you use every day, like Google Vids transforming a presentation into a video with an AI-generated script and voiceover.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>This deeper look at Gemini Enterprise shows just how ambitious and comprehensive it truly is. It’s about moving beyond simple chatbots to create a single, AI-powered hub that can automate complex workflows and give people time back to focus on their most high-impact work.</p>

<p>While much of the AI conversation has focused on consumer-facing tools, the race to transform the modern workplace is just as intense. Today, at a special “Gemini at Work” event, <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/gemini-enterprise-sundar-pichai/" target="_blank">Google CEO Sundar Pichai officially unveiled</a> the company’s next major step in that race: <strong>Gemini Enterprise.</strong></p>
<p>Positioned as the “new front door for AI in the workplace,” this isn’t just another chatbot. It’s a comprehensive and deeply integrated platform designed to bring the full power of Google’s AI to every employee and every workflow.</p><div>

<h2>More than just a chatbot</h2>
<p>The core premise of Gemini Enterprise is that true business transformation requires more than a simple chatbot. To that end, Google has built an AI-powered conversational platform that is grounded in your company’s information and your personal context at work.</p>
<p>This allows Gemini Enterprise to go far beyond answering simple questions. It enables employees to <strong>chat with a company’s internal documents, data, and applications.</strong> It also provides the tools for businesses to <strong>build and deploy their own custom AI agents</strong> for specific, repetitive tasks, and it comes with a suite of pre-built agents to get started.</p><div>

</div>
<div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>It’s a vision for a single, secure place where all of a company’s data, tools, and people can come together to leverage the power of AI.</p>
<h2>The power of a full-stack approach</h2>
<p>Pichai framed Gemini Enterprise as the culmination of Google’s “full-stack” approach to AI, which gives it a unique advantage. This new platform is the single entry point for organizations to access all of Google’s innovations, from its powerful, purpose-built infrastructure (like the upcoming Ironwood TPUs) and world-class research to its industry-leading foundation models like Gemini 2.5 Pro.</p>
<p>We’re already seeing the real-world impact of this approach with customers like HCA Healthcare, which is piloting a Gemini-powered solution to save millions of hours on nurse handoff reports, and at Google itself, where nearly half of all new code is now generated by AI.</p><div>

<p>Gemini Enterprise is a massive and ambitious new offering from Google Cloud. It’s a clear signal that Google is thinking beyond simple feature integrations and is instead building a foundational platform for the next generation of the AI-powered workplace.</p>

Today, at a special “Gemini at Work” event, <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/gemini-enterprise-sundar-pichai/" target="_blank">Google CEO Sundar Pichai officially unveiled</a> the company’s next major step in that race: <strong>Gemini Enterprise.</strong></p>
<p>Positioned as the “new front door for AI in the workplace,” this isn’t just another chatbot. It’s a comprehensive and deeply integrated platform designed to bring the full power of Google’s AI to every employee and every workflow.</p><div>

</div>
<h2>More than just a chatbot</h2>
<p>The core premise of Gemini Enterprise is that true business transformation requires more than a simple chatbot. To that end, Google has built an AI-powered conversational platform that is grounded in your company’s information and your personal context at work.</p>
<p>This allows Gemini Enterprise to go far beyond answering simple questions. It enables employees to <strong>chat with a company’s internal documents, data, and applications.</strong> It also provides the tools for businesses to <strong>build and deploy their own custom AI agents</strong> for specific, repetitive tasks, and it comes with a suite of pre-built agents to get started.</p><div>

</div>
<p>It’s a vision for a single, secure place where all of a company’s data, tools, and people can come together to leverage the power of AI.</p>
<h2>The power of a full-stack approach</h2>
<p>Pichai framed Gemini Enterprise as the culmination of Google’s “full-stack” approach to AI, which gives it a unique advantage. This new platform is the single entry point for organizations to access all of Google’s innovations, from its powerful, purpose-built infrastructure (like the upcoming Ironwood TPUs) and world-class research to its industry-leading foundation models like Gemini 2.5 Pro.</p>
<p>We’re already seeing the real-world impact of this approach with customers like HCA Healthcare, which is piloting a Gemini-powered solution to save millions of hours on nurse handoff reports, and at Google itself, where nearly half of all new code is now generated by AI.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>Gemini Enterprise is a massive and ambitious new offering from Google Cloud. It’s a clear signal that Google is thinking beyond simple feature integrations and is instead building a foundational platform for the next generation of the AI-powered workplace.</p>

<p>Powering those pixels will reportedly be <strong>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 processor,</strong> a chip capable of driving 4.3K resolution per eye at a smooth 90 frames per second. This is all part of the grand collaboration between Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm to build the first true hardware and software competitor to Apple’s immersive computing platform.</p>
<p>Many of the other leaked details track with what we’ve heard and seen in the past. The device will reportedly be controlled via hand, eye, and voice tracking, with Gemini AI built in for assistance. The leak also mentions a dial to adjust the head strap, comfortable-looking cushioning, and detachable light shields to block out your environment.</p><div>

<p>However, the leak also points to what might be a potential weak spot: battery life. The report suggests the headset will get up to <strong>two hours of general use,</strong> or 2.5 hours of video playback from an external battery pack. At 545 grams, it’s a bit lighter than the Vision Pro, but that battery life appears to be about the same. </p>

<p>However, the leak also points to what might be a potential weak spot: battery life. The report suggests the headset will get up to <strong>two hours of general use,</strong> or 2.5 hours of video playback from an external battery pack.

<p>The leak also included a screenshot of the One UI XR interface, showing a mix of Samsung and Google apps, including the Play Store, YouTube, Google Maps, and even Netflix, signaling a strong content push from day one. With the rumored <strong>October 21st launch</strong> just a couple of weeks away, we won’t have to wait much longer to see how this impressive-looking spec sheet translates into a real-world experience!</p>

<p>After months of teases at events <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/after-those-android-show-teases-im-hoping-for-android-xr-hands-on-demos-at-i-o/" target="_blank">like Google I/O</a> and <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/samsungs-project-moohan-android-xr-headset-teased-yet-again-at-mwc-2025/" target="_blank">MWC,</a> followed by a <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/the-first-android-xr-headset-from-samsung-could-be-just-a-month-away/" target="_blank">rumored October 21st launch date,</a> we finally have our best look yet at the hardware powering Samsung’s first Android XR headset. A <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-xr">new leak from <em>Android Headlines</em></a> has detailed the core specs of the “Project Moohan” device, and it’s clear Samsung is aiming directly at the top of the market with a display that could be even sharper than what’s in the Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>The headline feature from this leak is undoubtedly the display. The report claims the headset will feature a <strong>4K micro-OLED display with a stunning 4,032 pixels per inch (ppi).</strong> For context, the highly praised display in the Apple Vision Pro comes in at 3,386 ppi. If this spec holds true, Samsung will have a hardware advantage in visual fidelity right out of the gate.</p><div>

<p>The leak also included a screenshot of the One UI XR interface, showing a mix of Samsung and Google apps, including the Play Store, YouTube, Google Maps, and even Netflix, signaling a strong content push from day one. With the rumored <strong>October 21st launch</strong> just a couple of weeks away, we won’t have to wait much longer to see how this impressive-looking spec sheet translates into a real-world experience!</p>

<p>For the past couple of years, it’s felt like Google’s smart display lineup has been in a drought. With the last Nest Hub refresh happening in 2021 and the Pixel Tablet’s recent discontinuation, the question on everyone’s mind has been a simple one: is the Nest Hub donezo? After months and months of silence, we finally have an answer. In a new interview, Google’s head of Home, Anish Kattukaran, has confirmed that the company is <strong>“definitely committed to smart displays.”</strong></p>
<p>Speaking on an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794298/new-nest-hub-smart-display-google-home-coming-soon" target="_blank">episode of <em>The Vergecast</em>,</a> Kattukaran addressed the future of the category head-on. While they cautioned that there’s no “explicit news about smart displays” just yet, their comments painted a very clear and optimistic picture of where Google is headed. Kattukaran sees the smart display as the perfect vehicle for the new, more powerful Gemini for Home AI.</p><div>

<p>As I see where Gemini for Home is going and Gemini more broadly… for me it feels like almost the ultimate form factor to be able to deliver a really great home experience. So, that’s why we are going to continue to invest in that category…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kattukaran explained that the combination of a microphone, a speaker, and a screen makes the smart display the ideal multi-modal device for an advanced AI that can both talk to you and show you information visually.</p>

<p>While there’s no new “Google Home Hub” (the likely new branding) to preorder just yet, this is the most hopeful sign we’ve had in years.

<p>Google’s “Virtual Try-On” technology for clothing has been a fascinating and surprisingly useful application of AI, giving shoppers a better idea of how a shirt or dress might actually look on their body type. <a href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/virtual-try-on-shoes/" target="_blank">Today, Google is expanding</a> this impressive tech in two big ways: the existing clothing try-on is rolling out to more countries, and it’s also coming to a brand-new, and notoriously difficult to shop for, category: <strong>shoes.</strong></p>
<h2>Try on shoes right from your couch</h2>
<p>That’s right, you can now use Google’s AI to help answer the age-old question: “Can I pull off these shoes?” The new feature, which is rolling out starting today for shoppers in the U.S., works in a simple and intuitive way.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>When you’re browsing for shoes on Google, you can tap on a product listing with the “try it on” button. From there, you just need to <strong><a href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/how-to-use-google-shopping-try-it-on/" target="_blank">add a full-length photo of yourself,</a></strong> and within moments, Google’s state-of-the-art AI will show you what you might look like in those new heels or sneakers. The technology is smart enough to accurately perceive shapes and depths, preserving the subtle details to give you a surprisingly realistic preview.</p>
<h2>Expanding around the globe</h2>
<p>Alongside the new shoe category, Google also announced that its original virtual try-on feature for clothing will be expanding beyond the U.S. In the coming weeks, shoppers in <strong>Australia, Canada, and Japan</strong> will also be able to start using the tool.</p><div>

<p>This is another fun and genuinely practical application of Google’s AI that makes the often-frustrating experience of online shopping a little less of a guessing game. If you’re in the U.S., be on the lookout for the new “try it on” button as you shop for your next pair of shoes.</p>

From there, you just need to <strong><a href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/how-to-use-google-shopping-try-it-on/" target="_blank">add a full-length photo of yourself,</a></strong> and within moments, Google’s state-of-the-art AI will show you what you might look like in those new heels or sneakers. The technology is smart enough to accurately perceive shapes and depths, preserving the subtle details to give you a surprisingly realistic preview.</p>
<h2>Expanding around the globe</h2>
<p>Alongside the new shoe category, Google also announced that its original virtual try-on feature for clothing will be expanding beyond the U.S. In the coming weeks, shoppers in <strong>Australia, Canada, and Japan</strong> will also be able to start using the tool.</p><div>

</div>
<p>This is another fun and genuinely practical application of Google’s AI that makes the often-frustrating experience of online shopping a little less of a guessing game. If you’re in the U.S., be on the lookout for the new “try it on” button as you shop for your next pair of shoes.</p>

<p>Google’s “Virtual Try-On” technology for clothing has been a fascinating and surprisingly useful application of AI, giving shoppers a better idea of how a shirt or dress might actually look on their body type. <a href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/virtual-try-on-shoes/" target="_blank">Today, Google is expanding</a> this impressive tech in two big ways: the existing clothing try-on is rolling out to more countries, and it’s also coming to a brand-new, and notoriously difficult to shop for, category: <strong>shoes.</strong></p>
<h2>Try on shoes right from your couch</h2>
<p>That’s right, you can now use Google’s AI to help answer the age-old question: “Can I pull off these shoes?” The new feature, which is rolling out starting today for shoppers in the U.S., works in a simple and intuitive way.</p><div>

<p>Just a couple of months ago, Google Labs unveiled one of its most exciting experiments in a long time: <strong>Opal,</strong> a tool that lets anyone build their own AI-powered mini-apps using just natural language—no coding required. After an initial, U.S.-only launch, the creativity of early adopters has made one thing clear: Google needs to get this powerful tool into the hands of more people.</p>
<p>Today, Google is doing just that. <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/opal-expansion/" target="_blank">In a new blog post,</a> the company has announced that it is <strong>expanding Opal to 15 new countries</strong> and rolling out some powerful new features to make building custom AI apps even easier and more reliable.</p><div>

</div>
<h2>Opal goes global</h2>
<p>After seeing the “sophisticated, practical and highly creative” apps built by its initial user base, Google is beginning to roll out Opal to a much wider audience. The expansion includes 15 more countries, with notable additions like <strong>Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, and Brazil.</strong> This is a huge step in getting this powerful, democratized AI tool into the hands of more creators around the world.</p>
<p>Alongside the global expansion, Opal is also getting some significant upgrades based on early user feedback. The two biggest improvements are:</p><div>

<div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced no-code debugging:</strong> Building a complex workflow can be tricky, and finding out why something isn’t working can be frustrating. Opal now features an improved, visual debugging tool that lets you run your workflow step-by-step and shows you in real-time the exact step where a failure occurred, eliminating the guesswork.</li>
<li><strong>Faster performance:</strong> Google has also made significant under-the-hood improvements to Opal’s speed. Creating new apps is now “dramatically” faster, and complex workflows can now run multiple steps in parallel, reducing the overall wait time for your app to execute.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a fantastic sign of momentum for what is arguably one of the most interesting projects to come out of Google Labs. By continuing to expand and refine Opal, Google is doubling down on its effort to democratize AI, giving more people the tools to build their own custom solutions without needing to write a single line of code.</p>

<p>With the recent arrival of the experimental “Desktop Mode” in Android 16, the dream of a true, productive desktop experience powered by your phone is closer than ever. But as anyone who has tried it will tell you, there’s one glaring, persistent annoyance: websites still default to their mobile versions, even when you’re on a larger external monitor.</p>
<p>It seems Google is already working on a fix for this, however. <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-desktop-site-on-external-displays-3605011/" target="_blank">As spotted by Mishaal Rahman over at <em>Android Authority,</em></a> a new feature flag has emerged in Chrome for Android that finally solves this problem, automatically loading the desktop version of every site when you’re in Desktop Mode.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>The ‘user agent’ problem on external displays</h2>
<p>The issue all comes down to something called a “user agent.” This is a little string of text your browser sends to a website to identify itself. Even when you’re in the new Desktop Mode on a big screen, Chrome for Android still tells every website that it is a phone. This is why so many sites load their cramped, mobile layouts, forcing you into the repetitive and frustrating task of manually checking the “Desktop site” box for every single tab.</p>
<h2>A simple flag for a much better experience</h2>
<p>The new solution is a simple Chrome flag: <strong><code>#request-desktop-user-agent-on-external-displays</code></strong>. When enabled, this flag tells Chrome to do the logical thing: if it’s running in Desktop Mode on an external monitor, it should automatically send a <em>desktop</em> user agent.</p><div>
<h2>Featured Videos</h2>
</div>
<div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>The result is exactly what you’d expect. Websites like YouTube and Reddit now load their full, proper desktop layouts by default, with sidebars, top navigation, and all the other elements you’re used to seeing on a laptop or desktop. No more manual toggling required.</p>

<h2>A small step towards a bigger goal</h2>
<p>This isn’t just a small bug fix; it’s a critical and necessary step in Google’s larger ambition to make Android a viable desktop platform. As Google prepares to bring Android to PCs and <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/its-official-google-says-the-android-and-chromeos-merger-is-coming-next-year/" target="_blank">merge the foundations of its two operating systems,</a> getting these desktop experience details right is absolutely crucial. It’s these small, thoughtful changes that will ultimately determine whether Android can be taken seriously as a true desktop competitor.</p>

<p>With the recent arrival of the experimental “Desktop Mode” in Android 16, the dream of a true, productive desktop experience powered by your phone is closer than ever. But as anyone who has tried it will tell you, there’s one glaring, persistent annoyance: websites still default to their mobile versions, even when you’re on a larger external monitor.</p>
<p>It seems Google is already working on a fix for this, however. <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-desktop-site-on-external-displays-3605011/" target="_blank">As spotted by Mishaal Rahman over at <em>Android Authority,</em></a> a new feature flag has emerged in Chrome for Android that finally solves this problem, automatically loading the desktop version of every site when you’re in Desktop Mode.</p><div>

</div>
<h2>The ‘user agent’ problem on external displays</h2>
<p>The issue all comes down to something called a “user agent.” This is a little string of text your browser sends to a website to identify itself. Even when you’re in the new Desktop Mode on a big screen, Chrome for Android still tells every website that it is a phone. This is why so many sites load their cramped, mobile layouts, forcing you into the repetitive and frustrating task of manually checking the “Desktop site” box for every single tab.</p>
<h2>A simple flag for a much better experience</h2>
<p>The new solution is a simple Chrome flag: <strong><code>#request-desktop-user-agent-on-external-displays</code></strong>. When enabled, this flag tells Chrome to do the logical thing: if it’s running in Desktop Mode on an external monitor, it should automatically send a <em>desktop</em> user agent.</p><div>

<p>The result is exactly what you’d expect. Websites like YouTube and Reddit now load their full, proper desktop layouts by default, with sidebars, top navigation, and all the other elements you’re used to seeing on a laptop or desktop. No more manual toggling required.</p>

<p>For years, those of us who use Logitech mice and keyboards with our Chromebooks have relied on the trusty Logitech Unifying Receiver Chrome App. It was a simple utility that let you pair, un-pair, and manage the devices connected to your Logi dongle.

<h2>And yes, it’s a PWA</h2>
<p>The best part? This isn’t just a website; it’s a full-fledged Progressive Web App (PWA). When you visit the site, you’ll see the familiar install icon in your URL bar. With one click, you can install the Logi Web Connect tool as a lightweight, standalone app on your Chromebook. It will live in your app launcher just like any other app, ready to go the next time you need to manage your devices.</p>
<p>This is a fantastic and modern solution to a problem that I know has frustrated many Chromebook users. It’s a perfect example of the power of the open web and PWAs to solve problems in a clean, platform-agnostic way. If you use any Logitech peripherals with a dongle, I highly recommend you go install this PWA right now.</p>

<p>For years, those of us who use Logitech mice and keyboards with our Chromebooks have relied on the trusty Logitech Unifying Receiver Chrome App. It was a simple utility that let you pair, un-pair, and manage the devices connected to your Logi dongle. But with the somewhat-recent deprecation of Chrome Apps, that tool is no longer a thing.</p>
<p>So when I found myself needing to pair a new Logitech mouse to an existing Unifying Receiver using only my Chromebook, I was stuck. For a moment, I almost admitted defeat and considered digging out a Windows laptop just for this one task. But on a whim, I searched for a “Logitech web pairing tool,” and to my absolute delight, <strong>it actually exists.</strong></p><div>

<h2>Meet the Logi Web Connect tool</h2>
<p>If you’ve been in a similar situation, allow me to introduce you to the new app to use for all connected Logitech accessories: <strong><a href="https://logiwebconnect.com/" target="_blank">logiwebconnect.com.</a></strong> This simple, no-frills website is the modern, web-based replacement for the old Chrome App.</p>
<p>The process is incredibly straightforward. You just plug in your Logitech Unifying or Logi Bolt receiver, visit the site, and follow the on-screen prompts to put your mouse or keyboard into pairing mode. From the tool, you can see all your connected devices, add new ones, and remove old ones. It’s a clean, simple, and effective solution.</p><div>

      <![CDATA[<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/chromeunboxed.com-fe37f4aef0.webp">
<p>The story of the upcoming MediaTek MT8189-powered Chromebooks just keeps getting more interesting. <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/evidence-emerges-of-new-chromebook-tablets-with-the-mediatek-mt8189-inside/" target="_blank">We recently uncovered</a> that the ‘Jedi’ baseboard and its first offshoot, ‘Padme’, are being developed specifically for a new generation of Chromebook tablets. The prospect of a new, powerful ARM-based tablet has been exciting enough on its own.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to some new commits in the Chromium Gerrit and messages on the Linux Kernel Mailing List, we have our first concrete hardware specification for ‘Padme’: <strong>its screen size and resolution. And it’s a larger display than we expected for sure.</strong></p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>

<div>
<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/chromeunboxed.com-a0c01068fd.png"><figcaption><a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/third_party/coreboot/+/7007778" target="_blank">via the Chromium Gerrit</a></figcaption></div>
<h2>12.1-inch QHD+ display</h2>
<p>The new code changes add support for a specific display panel (the Tianma TL121BVMS07_00C) to the ‘Jedi’ baseboard that ‘Padme’ is built on. Digging into the details (<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/9/30/393">here</a> and <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/9/30/395">here</a>) of this panel found on LKML.org, we can confirm the key specs for ‘Padme’s screen:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size:</strong> 12.1 inches</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> QHD+ 2560×1600</li>
<li><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> 16:10</li>
</ul>
<p>With a 12.1-inch screen, ‘Padme’ is a significant step up in size from some of the most popular Chromebook tablets of the past – like the excellent Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11″.</p><div>

<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>This larger, higher-resolution screen clearly positions ‘Padme’ not as a small, secondary content consumption device, but as a more premium, productivity-focused tablet that can be a true laptop replacement. A powerful and efficient processor like the MediaTek MT8189 deserves a large, high-resolution screen to go with it, and it looks like that’s exactly what we’re going to get.</p>
<p>The picture of ‘Padme’ is starting to become at least a tad clearer, but there are far more questions to be answered for sure. As always, we’ll continue tracking its development and will report back as soon as more hardware details emerge.</p>

<p>The story of the upcoming MediaTek MT8189-powered Chromebooks just keeps getting more interesting. <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/evidence-emerges-of-new-chromebook-tablets-with-the-mediatek-mt8189-inside/" target="_blank">We recently uncovered</a> that the ‘Jedi’ baseboard and its first offshoot, ‘Padme’, are being developed specifically for a new generation of Chromebook tablets. The prospect of a new, powerful ARM-based tablet has been exciting enough on its own.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to some new commits in the Chromium Gerrit and messages on the Linux Kernel Mailing List, we have our first concrete hardware specification for ‘Padme’: <strong>its screen size and resolution. And it’s a larger display than we expected for sure.</strong></p><div>

<h2>12.1-inch QHD+ display</h2>
<p>The new code changes add support for a specific display panel (the Tianma TL121BVMS07_00C) to the ‘Jedi’ baseboard that ‘Padme’ is built on. Digging into the details (<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/9/30/393">here</a> and <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/9/30/395">here</a>) of this panel found on LKML.org, we can confirm the key specs for ‘Padme’s screen:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size:</strong> 12.1 inches</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> QHD+ 2560×1600</li>
<li><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> 16:10</li>
</ul>
<p>With a 12.1-inch screen, ‘Padme’ is a significant step up in size from some of the most popular Chromebook tablets of the past – like the excellent Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11″.</p><div>

</div>
<p>This larger, higher-resolution screen clearly positions ‘Padme’ not as a small, secondary content consumption device, but as a more premium, productivity-focused tablet that can be a true laptop replacement. A powerful and efficient processor like the MediaTek MT8189 deserves a large, high-resolution screen to go with it, and it looks like that’s exactly what we’re going to get.</p>
<p>The picture of ‘Padme’ is starting to become at least a tad clearer, but there are far more questions to be answered for sure. As always, we’ll continue tracking its development and will report back as soon as more hardware details emerge.</p>

<p>When it comes to premium, thin-and-light Chromebooks, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus is in a class of its own. With its gorgeous screen, razor-thin aluminum chassis, and excellent keyboard, it’s one of the most well-built and enjoyable clamshell Chromebooks on the market.</p>
<p>And right now, this fantastic Chromebook Plus is on sale for just <strong>$599.99</strong> at both Samsung’s store and at Best Buy, but as I’ve said many times in the past, there are some nice perks to buying Chromebooks direct from the manufacturer.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>A quick recap of a fantastic Chromebook</h2>
<p>As a quick reminder, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus is a standout device. It features a beautiful <strong>15.6-inch FHD AMOLED display,</strong> an Intel Core 3 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB of SSD storage. It’s the combination of these solid Chromebook Plus specs with an impossibly thin and light all-metal build that makes this device feel so special.</p>

</div>
<p>Right now, you have two options to get this Chromebook for $599.99, but I’d steer you towards buying it directly from Samsung to take advantage of a few key benefits. First, Samsung offers the option to add extended warranty and accidental damage protection. Second, their return policy gives you a larger return window: 15 days to initiate a return and an additional 15 days to ship the device back. Finally, Samsung frequently leverages attractive trade-in offers that can lower the final cost quite a bit depending on the device you have around and are willing to part with.</p><div>

<p>Either way you choose, getting the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus for $599.99 is a fantastic deal that you don’t want to miss out on.  It’s a stellar Chromebook experience that is now at a super-attractive price point.  But this one is notorious for going on sale and having that discount disappear quickly.  Don’t miss this opportunity!</p>

<p>As the world continues to marvel at the creative and productive power of AI, there’s another, darker side to the story: bad actors are already exploring ways to use this same technology to create faster and more sophisticated cyberattacks. <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/ai-security-frontier-strategy-tools/" target="_blank">In a new announcement,</a> Google has laid out its strategy to get ahead of this threat – fight fire with fire.</p>
<p>Google is flipping the script, using its own powerful AI to create a “decisive advantage for cyber defenders.” The strategy includes an updated security framework and a new bug bounty program, but the star of the show is a stunning new AI-powered agent called <strong>CodeMender.</strong></p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>Meet CodeMender, the AI that finds and fixes code</h2>
<p>At its core, CodeMender is an AI agent that can <strong>autonomously find, patch, and validate fixes for critical code vulnerabilities.</strong> This isn’t just about finding bugs; it’s about fixing them, automatically.</p>
<p>The process is a brilliant showcase of AI collaboration. First, CodeMender uses Gemini’s advanced reasoning to perform a root cause analysis and find the fundamental source of a vulnerability. Then, it autonomously generates and applies a code patch to fix it. </p><div>

</div>
<div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, that patch is routed to specialized “critique” AI agents that act as automated peer reviewers, rigorously validating the fix for correctness and security before it’s ever proposed to a human for final sign-off. It’s a massive leap forward in proactive, automated cyber defense that could dramatically accelerate the time it takes to secure vulnerable software.</p>
<h2>A new bug bounty program and a framework for the future</h2>
<p>Alongside CodeMender, Google also announced two other key initiatives. First is a new, dedicated <strong>AI Vulnerability Reward Program (AI VRP),</strong> which will provide a clear and comprehensive set of rules and rewards to incentivize the global security research community to find and report high-impact flaws in Google’s AI systems.</p>
<p>Second, Google is updating its <strong>Secure AI Framework to version 2.0 (SAIF 2.0).</strong> This update specifically addresses the emerging risks of autonomous AI agents, with new guidance and a set of core principles to ensure they are built securely, including having well-defined human controllers and carefully limited powers.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>This is a significant and proactive announcement from Google that shows they are thinking deeply about the security implications of the AI era. It’s a clear commitment to using the power of AI to tip the scales in favor of the defenders, not the attackers, and it’s fantastic to see them leading the charge in building a safer AI future.</p>

<p>As the world continues to marvel at the creative and productive power of AI, there’s another, darker side to the story: bad actors are already exploring ways to use this same technology to create faster and more sophisticated cyberattacks. <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/ai-security-frontier-strategy-tools/" target="_blank">In a new announcement,</a> Google has laid out its strategy to get ahead of this threat – fight fire with fire.</p>
<p>Google is flipping the script, using its own powerful AI to create a “decisive advantage for cyber defenders.” The strategy includes an updated security framework and a new bug bounty program, but the star of the show is a stunning new AI-powered agent called <strong>CodeMender.</strong></p><div>

<h2>Meet CodeMender, the AI that finds and fixes code</h2>
<p>At its core, CodeMender is an AI agent that can <strong>autonomously find, patch, and validate fixes for critical code vulnerabilities.</strong> This isn’t just about finding bugs; it’s about fixing them, automatically.</p>
<p>The process is a brilliant showcase of AI collaboration. First, CodeMender uses Gemini’s advanced reasoning to perform a root cause analysis and find the fundamental source of a vulnerability. Then, it autonomously generates and applies a code patch to fix it. </p><div>

</div>
<div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, that patch is routed to specialized “critique” AI agents that act as automated peer reviewers, rigorously validating the fix for correctness and security before it’s ever proposed to a human for final sign-off. It’s a massive leap forward in proactive, automated cyber defense that could dramatically accelerate the time it takes to secure vulnerable software.</p>
<h2>A new bug bounty program and a framework for the future</h2>
<p>Alongside CodeMender, Google also announced two other key initiatives. First is a new, dedicated <strong>AI Vulnerability Reward Program (AI VRP),</strong> which will provide a clear and comprehensive set of rules and rewards to incentivize the global security research community to find and report high-impact flaws in Google’s AI systems.</p>
<p>Second, Google is updating its <strong>Secure AI Framework to version 2.0 (SAIF 2.0).</strong> This update specifically addresses the emerging risks of autonomous AI agents, with new guidance and a set of core principles to ensure they are built securely, including having well-defined human controllers and carefully limited powers.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>This is a significant and proactive announcement from Google that shows they are thinking deeply about the security implications of the AI era. It’s a clear commitment to using the power of AI to tip the scales in favor of the defenders, not the attackers, and it’s fantastic to see them leading the charge in building a safer AI future.</p>

<p>It has always been a bit of a strange omission; for years, if you wanted to give someone the gift of Google Play credit, you had to physically go to a store and buy a plastic gift card. In a world where everything is digital, it felt like a relic of a bygone era.</p>
<p>Well, that is finally changing. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/03/google-play-gift-cards/" target="_blank">As reported by <em>9to5Google,</em></a> a new update is rolling out to the Google Play Store on Android that finally allows you to <strong>directly buy and send digital gift cards</strong> right from the app.</p><div>

</div>
<h2>How the new feature works</h2>
<p>The new, long-overdue feature is simple and seamlessly integrated. If it has rolled out for you, you’ll find a new <strong>“Gift cards”</strong> item in your profile menu (when you tap your picture in the top-right corner).</p>
<p>From there, you can choose a Google Play gift card in values ranging from $15 to $100, or you can browse a carousel of gift cards from other top brands across categories like retail, dining, and entertainment. The sending process is just as easy as you’d hope. You simply:</p><div>

<li>Select a virtual card design.</li>
<li>Choose the amount.</li>
<li>Enter the recipient’s email address.</li>
<li>Add a custom gift message.</li>
</ol>
<p>The recipient will then get an email or text message with a link to their new gift card. The whole process is powered by a partnership with Blackhawk Network.</p>
<p>This is a fantastic and incredibly convenient feature that makes giving the gift of apps, games, movies, and books from the Play Store easier than ever. It’s a simple quality-of-life improvement that we’re thrilled to see finally arrive. The new feature is currently rolling out, so be sure to check your Play Store app for the new option.</p>

<p>It’s been about two weeks since ChromeOS 140 began rolling out to the stable channel, and if you’ve been waiting for a post from us detailing all the new features, you’re not alone. With every new milestone update, we get excited to dig in, flip some flags, and find all the latest goodies. <strong>But with ChromeOS 140, we’ve come up almost completely empty.</strong></p>
<p>And as it turns out, we’re not the only ones. Two weeks after its arrival, new features in ChromeOS 140 remain a bit of a mystery. We haven’t been able to discern any significant user-facing changes, and more tellingly, <strong>Google has yet to publish any official release notes for the update.</strong></p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>The silence is deafening</h2>
<p>Typically, within a day or two of a new version of ChromeOS arriving, we get the official release notes detailing the new additions. The complete absence of these notes for M140 is highly unusual and the clearest sign yet that there’s likely not anything really worth mentioning for most users in this update. Sure, there are always under-the-hood security patches and bug fixes, but the lack of any new features is most definitely notable and, frankly, a bit of a bummer.</p>
<h2>Is this the calm before the storm?</h2>
<p>This quiet update does have me wondering if it is indicative of what we can expect for the next little bit? With the massive, <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/its-official-google-says-the-android-and-chromeos-merger-is-coming-next-year/" target="_blank">foundational work being done to merge Android and ChromeOS,</a> it feels plausible that we could be entering a temporary lull in major, splashy feature drops for the current version of the OS.</p><div>

<p>As the development teams focus their energy on those huge, behind-the-scenes architectural changes, it’s possible that the next few milestone updates might be similarly quiet. While I’m not entirely sure that’s the case, the radio silence around ChromeOS 140 certainly makes it feel that way.</p>
<p>For now, the takeaway is simple: don’t expect any big, flashy new tricks from the ChromeOS 140 update. It appears to be a maintenance release, through and through. While the present might be a bit quiet on the feature front, we’re still incredibly excited about the big changes on the horizon for ChromeOS.</p>

<p>It’s been about two weeks since ChromeOS 140 began rolling out to the stable channel, and if you’ve been waiting for a post from us detailing all the new features, you’re not alone. With every new milestone update, we get excited to dig in, flip some flags, and find all the latest goodies. <strong>But with ChromeOS 140, we’ve come up almost completely empty.</strong></p>
<p>And as it turns out, we’re not the only ones. Two weeks after its arrival, new features in ChromeOS 140 remain a bit of a mystery. We haven’t been able to discern any significant user-facing changes, and more tellingly, <strong>Google has yet to publish any official release notes for the update.</strong></p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>The silence is deafening</h2>
<p>Typically, within a day or two of a new version of ChromeOS arriving, we get the official release notes detailing the new additions. The complete absence of these notes for M140 is highly unusual and the clearest sign yet that there’s likely not anything really worth mentioning for most users in this update. Sure, there are always under-the-hood security patches and bug fixes, but the lack of any new features is most definitely notable and, frankly, a bit of a bummer.</p>
<h2>Is this the calm before the storm?</h2>
<p>This quiet update does have me wondering if it is indicative of what we can expect for the next little bit? With the massive, <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/its-official-google-says-the-android-and-chromeos-merger-is-coming-next-year/" target="_blank">foundational work being done to merge Android and ChromeOS,</a> it feels plausible that we could be entering a temporary lull in major, splashy feature drops for the current version of the OS.</p><div>

<p>End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is the gold standard for secure communication, ensuring that only the sender and the intended recipient can ever read a message. But for email, implementing it has always been a clunky, complicated affair, especially when trying to communicate with someone outside of your own organization. It often involved exchanging encryption keys or using special software, creating a huge barrier to adoption.</p>
<p><a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/10/send-gmail-end-to-end-encrypted-emails-in-gmail.html" target="_blank">In a fantastic new update,</a> Google is rolling out a feature for its top-tier Workspace customers that finally solves this problem, allowing users with Gmail client-side encryption to send <strong>E2EE emails to anyone,</strong> regardless of their email provider.</p><div>

<h2>A seamless guest experience</h2>
<p>The brilliance of this new feature lies in its simplicity for the recipient. When an external user receives an E2EE email, they’ll get a notification and a link. Clicking that link allows them to <strong>easily access the encrypted message via a guest account</strong> in a restricted, secure version of the Gmail web interface.</p>
<p>This process completely removes the traditional hassle. There are no keys to exchange and no special software to install. It “just works,” removing all the underlying complexity to provide a seamless and secure experience for both the sender and the receiver.</p><div>

<h2>Who this is for</h2>
<p>Now, before you go looking for this in your personal Gmail account, it’s important to note that this is a very high-end, enterprise-level security feature. For now, this capability is only available for <strong>Google Workspace Enterprise Plus</strong> customers who also have the <strong>Assured Controls add-on.</strong></p>
<p>For the organizations that require this level of enhanced data sovereignty and security—think government, finance, or healthcare—this is a massive deal. It allows them to maintain the highest level of security while still being able to communicate easily with outside partners, clients, and vendors.</p>
<p>While this feature won’t be coming to the masses anytime soon, it’s a significant and impressive step forward in making true, high-level email security both practical and user-friendly. The feature is rolling out now for eligible organizations.</p><div>

<p>Just a couple of weeks ago, Google unveiled a massive suite of new AI features for the Chrome browser, with the “Gemini in Chrome” AI browsing assistant as the clear centerpiece. Today, the wait is over for business and education users, as <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/10/use-gemini-in-chrome-ai-browsing-assistant.html" target="_blank">Google is now beginning</a> the <strong>general availability roll-out of Gemini in Chrome for eligible Google Workspace customers.</strong> This is a huge move that brings one of the most powerful new AI productivity tools directly into the professional workflow for users on Mac, Windows, and iOS.</p>

<h2>What is Gemini in Chrome? A quick recap</h2>
<p>For those who missed <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/gemini-in-chrome-is-here-and-its-bringing-agentic-ai-to-help-wherever-you-are-on-the-web/">the initial announcement,</a> Gemini in Chrome is a deeply integrated AI assistant that lives in your browser. Its killer feature is the ability to understand and work with the context of what you’re doing, referencing <strong>up to 10 of your open browser tabs</strong> along with the Google Workspace app.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>This allows it to perform complex tasks like summarizing and comparing information across multiple websites, answering in-depth questions, and having two-way conversations via Gemini Live, all without you ever having to leave your flow.</p>
<h2>The important details for Workspace users</h2>
<p>For business and education users, this rollout comes with the necessary controls and protections. Google has confirmed that Gemini in Chrome for Workspace includes <strong>enterprise-grade data protections,</strong> meaning your content is not reviewed by humans or used for model training without permission.</p><div>
<h2>Featured Videos</h2>
</div>
<div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>Workspace administrators will also have granular control over the feature. It will be <strong>ON by default</strong> for organizations that already have the Gemini app enabled, but admins can turn it on or off at the domain, organizational unit, or group level.</p>
<p>It is important to note a few initial limitations for this launch. For now, the feature is available <strong>in the US and in English only,</strong> for users 18 and older. It is also <strong>blocked for customers who are under a HIPAA Business Associate Amendment (BAA).</strong></p>
<p>This is a fantastic and powerful new tool for Workspace users, and it’s exciting to see it begin to arrive. The feature is on an extended roll-out schedule, so it may take 15 days or more to appear for all eligible users.</p><div>

<p>Just a couple of weeks ago, Google unveiled a massive suite of new AI features for the Chrome browser, with the “Gemini in Chrome” AI browsing assistant as the clear centerpiece. Today, the wait is over for business and education users, as <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/10/use-gemini-in-chrome-ai-browsing-assistant.html" target="_blank">Google is now beginning</a> the <strong>general availability roll-out of Gemini in Chrome for eligible Google Workspace customers.</strong> This is a huge move that brings one of the most powerful new AI productivity tools directly into the professional workflow for users on Mac, Windows, and iOS.</p>

<h2>What is Gemini in Chrome? A quick recap</h2>
<p>For those who missed <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/gemini-in-chrome-is-here-and-its-bringing-agentic-ai-to-help-wherever-you-are-on-the-web/">the initial announcement,</a> Gemini in Chrome is a deeply integrated AI assistant that lives in your browser. Its killer feature is the ability to understand and work with the context of what you’re doing, referencing <strong>up to 10 of your open browser tabs</strong> along with the Google Workspace app.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>This allows it to perform complex tasks like summarizing and comparing information across multiple websites, answering in-depth questions, and having two-way conversations via Gemini Live, all without you ever having to leave your flow.</p>
<h2>The important details for Workspace users</h2>
<p>For business and education users, this rollout comes with the necessary controls and protections. Google has confirmed that Gemini in Chrome for Workspace includes <strong>enterprise-grade data protections,</strong> meaning your content is not reviewed by humans or used for model training without permission.</p><div>

<p>Let’s be honest: dealing with voicemails in 2025 can feel like a chore. Between spam calls and the time it takes to listen to a message, it’s often an inefficient way to communicate. In a fantastic new update, <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/take-a-message-pixel-10/" target="_blank">Google is rolling out</a> a feature on the Pixel 10 series called <strong>“Take a Message”</strong> that uses the best of its conversational AI to offer a far smarter way to handle your missed or declined calls.</p>
<p>This new feature is the perfect combination of two of the Pixel’s most beloved calling tools—Call Screen and Call Notes—to create the modern, intelligent voicemail system we’ve all been wanting all along.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>How ‘Take a Message’ works</h2>
<p>The process is simple but incredibly powerful. First, the feature runs entirely on-device and uses the same powerful <strong>spam detection model as Call Screen,</strong> filtering out the junk so you only have to deal with messages from legitimate callers.</p>
<p>For those real calls that you miss or have to decline, “Take a Message” then creates a <strong>real-time transcript</strong> of the voice message as it’s being left. This lets you quickly read the message at a glance instead of having to stop what you’re doing to listen to it.</p><div>
<h2>Featured Videos</h2>
</div>
<div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, after the call is over, the feature uses AI—just like the Call Notes feature—to generate <strong>suggested next steps.</strong> This ensures you don’t miss any critical details, like a phone number to call back or an appointment time to add to your calendar.</p>
<p>“Take a Message” is a brilliant and practical new addition to the Pixel 10’s software arsenal. It’s the logical evolution of the Pixel’s calling experience, taking the best parts of existing features and combining them to solve an everyday annoyance. As it has done in the past, Google is leveraging their smartphone capabilities on Pixel to do genuinely useful things that make users want to stick around, and this latest perk is now available on all of the new Pixel 10 phones.</p>

<p><a href="https://jules.google/" target="_blank">Jules, Google’s AI-powered coding agent,</a> has been a powerful tool for developers, helping with everything from generating code and fixing bugs to writing tests and improving performance. But until now, using it meant working primarily through its dedicated website or a GitHub interface. In a step toward making Jules a true, seamless collaborator, Google is now bringing its AI agent directly into the developer’s natural habitat with a new command-line interface and a powerful API.</p>
<p>The first major update is Jules Tools, a new lightweight command-line interface (CLI). This allows developers to bring Jules directly into their terminal, where they can start, stop, and verify tasks right alongside their own commands. This is a game-changer for workflow efficiency. It’s the simplest way to move from chatting with Jules on a website to having it work alongside you in your actual development environment, right where the coding happens.</p><div>

<p>For even deeper integration, Google is also opening up access to the Jules API. This makes it possible to wire Jules directly into your own systems and workflows. The company gives examples like triggering tasks automatically when a bug is filed in Slack or integrating Jules into a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and fixes. The API is all about putting Jules closer to the way development teams already build, making it a more organic part of the process. Support for Google Workspace users is also slated to arrive later this month.</p>

Over the past few weeks, Google has been focused on improving Jules’ reliability and quality, reducing latency, and fixing common setup issues. They’ve also <a href="https://jules.google/docs/changelog" target="_blank">rolled out key features</a> like a File Selector to provide tighter context in chat, Memory so Jules can remember your preferences over time, and a structured way for Jules to access Environment Variables.</p><div>

<p><a href="https://jules.google/" target="_blank">Jules, Google’s AI-powered coding agent,</a> has been a powerful tool for developers, helping with everything from generating code and fixing bugs to writing tests and improving performance. But until now, using it meant working primarily through its dedicated website or a GitHub interface. In a step toward making Jules a true, seamless collaborator, Google is now bringing its AI agent directly into the developer’s natural habitat with a new command-line interface and a powerful API.</p>
<p>The first major update is Jules Tools, a new lightweight command-line interface (CLI). This allows developers to bring Jules directly into their terminal, where they can start, stop, and verify tasks right alongside their own commands. This is a game-changer for workflow efficiency. It’s the simplest way to move from chatting with Jules on a website to having it work alongside you in your actual development environment, right where the coding happens.</p><div>

<p>For even deeper integration, Google is also opening up access to the Jules API. This makes it possible to wire Jules directly into your own systems and workflows. The company gives examples like triggering tasks automatically when a bug is filed in Slack or integrating Jules into a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and fixes. The API is all about putting Jules closer to the way development teams already build, making it a more organic part of the process. Support for Google Workspace users is also slated to arrive later this month.</p>

</div>
<p>These new access points are built on a foundation of recent improvements to the core experience. Over the past few weeks, Google has been focused on improving Jules’ reliability and quality, reducing latency, and fixing common setup issues. They’ve also <a href="https://jules.google/docs/changelog" target="_blank">rolled out key features</a> like a File Selector to provide tighter context in chat, Memory so Jules can remember your preferences over time, and a structured way for Jules to access Environment Variables.</p><div>

<p>The new Pixel Buds 2a, Google’s latest entry into the affordable earbud market, are not just a minor refresh. In a recent episode of the Made by Google podcast, host Rachid Finge sat down with Pixel Buds Product Manager Vanessa Pau to get the inside story behind these new earbuds; and it’s clear Google focused on delivering pro-level features at a more accessible price point.</p>
<p>The conversation revealed a thoughtful approach to balancing essential upgrades with smart trade-offs, making the Pixel Buds 2a a compelling option for many at a very reasonable price point.</p><div>

</div>
<h2>Pro-level Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)</h2>
<p>One of the biggest takeaways is the emphasis on <strong>Active Noise Cancellation (ANC).</strong> Vanessa Pau confirmed that the top request from users of the previous A-series was the addition of ANC. And Google didn’t just check a box. Thanks to the power of the <strong>Tensor A1 chip,</strong> the Pixel Buds 2a deliver “pro-level active noise cancellation” that is actually <strong>1.5 times stronger than the first-generation Pixel Buds Pro.</strong> This means serious immersion for your music and podcasts, even in noisy environments.</p>
<h2>Doubled battery life and a clever case</h2>
<p>Battery life was another key area of improvement. The Tensor A1 chip’s power efficiency contributes to longer listening times, but the case also plays a crucial role. The Pixel Buds 2a offer <strong>seven hours of listening with ANC on (10 hours with ANC off),</strong> effectively doubling the runtime of the original A-series.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>And speaking of the case, it holds another fantastic, user-first feature: a <strong>user-replaceable battery.</strong> Google designed the case so that with basic tools and a repair manual, users can swap out the battery themselves. They even added a “spearmint” colored pull tab to make the process easier, a new visual signal that signifies a user-serviceable component across the Pixel portfolio.</p>
<h2>Other notable features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved Transparency Mode:</strong> Allowing you to stay aware of your surroundings when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Custom-designed 11mm speaker drivers</strong> with a five-band customizable EQ for great sound quality.</li>
<li>A <strong>“twist-to-adjust” stabilizer</strong> inspired by the Pixel Buds Pro 2, allowing for a more secure or comfortable fit.</li>
<li><strong>AI-powered wind suppression</strong> and a <strong>voice call model</strong> that isolates your voice for clear calls, even in windy conditions.</li>
<li>A clever software solution for <strong>finding a misplaced case</strong> (it can ring the earbuds loudly even when the lid is closed).</li>
</ul>
<p>To meet the compelling price point ($129), some smart trade-offs were made, such as the absence of a speaker in the charging case. However, the Pixel Buds 2a still offer support for the new Android 16 Find Hub.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>The Pixel Buds 2a are a testament to Google’s ability to bring high-impact features to a more accessible price. With pro-level ANC, significantly improved battery life, and a focus on repairability, these earbuds offer a fantastic balance for everyday users that want a high-quality set of earbuds at a very fair price.</p><div>

<p>The ability to create custom, AI-generated backgrounds in Google Meet has been a fantastic feature for desktop users. It’s a fun way to express your personality, reinforce your company’s branding, or simply hide the messy room behind you during a video call. But until now, this fun tool has been a desktop-only affair.</p>
<p>That’s finally changing. <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/10/generate-ai-backgrounds-google-meet-mobile.html" target="_blank">In a new post</a> on the Workspace Updates blog, Google has announced that it is now rolling out the ability to <strong>create custom, AI-generated background images with Gemini directly from the Google Meet app on your Android or iOS device.</strong></p><div>

<p>This is a much-needed update that brings one of the web version’s best features to your phone. Whether you’re taking a call from a coffee shop, an airport, or your car, you can now use a simple text prompt to have Gemini generate a unique, high-quality background image for you on the fly.</p>
<p>It’s a great feature for adding a professional touch or a bit of personality to your meetings, even when you’re away from your desk.

<p>The ability to create custom, AI-generated backgrounds in Google Meet has been a fantastic feature for desktop users. It’s a fun way to express your personality, reinforce your company’s branding, or simply hide the messy room behind you during a video call. But until now, this fun tool has been a desktop-only affair.</p>
<p>That’s finally changing. <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/10/generate-ai-backgrounds-google-meet-mobile.html" target="_blank">In a new post</a> on the Workspace Updates blog, Google has announced that it is now rolling out the ability to <strong>create custom, AI-generated background images with Gemini directly from the Google Meet app on your Android or iOS device.</strong></p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>Your custom background, now on the go</h2>
<p>This is a much-needed update that brings one of the web version’s best features to your phone. Whether you’re taking a call from a coffee shop, an airport, or your car, you can now use a simple text prompt to have Gemini generate a unique, high-quality background image for you on the fly.</p>
<p>It’s a great feature for adding a professional touch or a bit of personality to your meetings, even when you’re away from your desk. This update brings the mobile Google Meet app to feature parity with the web, ensuring you have the same powerful and creative tools no matter where you’re joining from.</p><div>

<p>The new feature is available now for some users and will begin a wider, gradual roll-out for most others starting on <strong>October 8, 2025.</strong> It’s available to most paid Workspace subscribers, including <strong>Business Standard/Plus and Enterprise Standard/Plus,</strong> as well as users with the <strong>Google AI Pro for Education</strong> add-on.</p>

<p>After yesterday’s massive announcement of <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/googles-new-gemini-for-home-is-a-brilliant-ai-upgrade-but-the-best-features-will-cost-you/" target="_blank">Gemini for Home,</a> the big question on everyone’s mind was a simple one: <em>“Will my existing speakers and smart displays get this new, smarter assistant?”</em> We’ve all been burned by new software features being limited to the latest hardware, and many were bracing for bad news.</p>
<p>Well, the answer is here, and it is a resounding and very welcome <strong>yes.</strong> In an incredible show of long-term support for its hardware, Google has confirmed that <strong>every single Home speaker and Nest smart display released in the last decade will be upgraded to Gemini.</strong></p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>The free Gemini upgrade for everyone</h2>
<p>That’s right, <strong>even the original 2016 Google Home speaker</strong> is getting a massive brain transplant. The core Gemini for Home voice assistant—the part that brings more natural, contextual conversations, a better understanding of complex requests, and 10 new, less robotic voices—will be a <strong>free upgrade</strong> for a huge list of legacy devices. Here’s the full list of existing devices that will be upgraded to the base Gemini assistant, with the early access program set to begin at the <strong>end of October:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google Home (2016)</li>
<li>Google Home Mini (2017)</li>
<li>Google Home Max (2017)</li>
<li>Nest Mini (2019)</li>
<li>Nest Wifi point (2019)</li>
<li>Nest Audio (2020)</li>
<li>Nest Hub (2018)</li>
<li>Nest Hub Max (2019)</li>
<li>Nest Hub (2nd gen, 2021)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The catch: Gemini Live is for newer devices and subscribers</h2>
<p>As you might expect, the most computationally intensive new feature, <strong>Gemini Live,</strong> will not be coming to all of those older devices. Gemini Live is the “hotword-free” continuous conversation mode that allows for a more natural back-and-forth chat.<sup></sup></p><div>
<h2>Featured Videos</h2>
</div>
<div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>To use Gemini Live, you’ll need two things: a newer, more powerful device and a <strong>Google Home Premium subscription.<sup></sup></strong> The specific devices that will support Gemini Live are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nest Audio</li>
<li>Nest Hub Max</li>
<li>Nest Hub (2nd gen)</li>
<li>The upcoming Google Home Speaker (Spring 2026)</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, to see an eight-year-old smart speaker getting a free upgrade to the company’s latest and greatest AI is a huge, pro-consumer decision that deserves a lot of praise. While the most advanced features will require newer hardware and a subscription, the fact that the core, smarter Gemini experience is coming to everyone is a massive win for all Google Home users.</p>

<p>In the ongoing battle for browser dominance, it seems Google Chrome’s position is more secure than ever. According to the latest desktop market share <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share" target="_blank">data from Statcounter</a> <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/google-chrome-continues-crushing-other-browsers-reaches-new-all-time-high/" target="_blank">(via NeoWin)</a> for the month of September 2025, <strong>Google Chrome has not only widened its massive lead, but has also surged to a new, all-time high.</strong></p>
<p>This impressive growth comes at a time when all the major browsers are racing to integrate AI, and it’s a clear sign that Google’s strategy is resonating with users in a big way.</p><div>

<p>The latest report shows Chrome’s desktop market share has jumped to a whopping <strong>71.86%,</strong> a significant <strong>2.6-point increase</strong> in just a single month. This growth appears to have come directly at the expense of its main competitors, who all saw their share decline. Here’s how the desktop browser market looked at the end of September:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Chrome:</strong> 71.86%</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Edge:</strong> 10.37%</li>
<li><strong>Apple Safari:</strong> 5.69%</li>
<li><strong>Mozilla Firefox:</strong> 4.93%</li>
</ul>
<p>While Microsoft Edge holds onto a distant second place, both it and Safari saw notable drops. Perhaps most significantly, this new data shows Mozilla’s Firefox slipping below the 5% mark for the first time in a long while.</p><div>

<p>While other browsers are also adding their own AI features, it seems Google’s deep integration and powerful models are helping to not just maintain but accelerate Chrome’s dominance. With its market share now approaching three-quarters of the entire desktop browser landscape, Google Chrome is truly in a league of its own. </p>

<p>In the ongoing battle for browser dominance, it seems Google Chrome’s position is more secure than ever. According to the latest desktop market share <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share" target="_blank">data from Statcounter</a> <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/google-chrome-continues-crushing-other-browsers-reaches-new-all-time-high/" target="_blank">(via NeoWin)</a> for the month of September 2025, <strong>Google Chrome has not only widened its massive lead, but has also surged to a new, all-time high.</strong></p>
<p>This impressive growth comes at a time when all the major browsers are racing to integrate AI, and it’s a clear sign that Google’s strategy is resonating with users in a big way.</p><div>

<h2>The staggering numbers</h2>
<div>
<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/chromeunboxed.com-fe176dd5f8.webp"></div>
<p>The latest report shows Chrome’s desktop market share has jumped to a whopping <strong>71.86%,</strong> a significant <strong>2.6-point increase</strong> in just a single month. This growth appears to have come directly at the expense of its main competitors, who all saw their share decline. Here’s how the desktop browser market looked at the end of September:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Chrome:</strong> 71.86%</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Edge:</strong> 10.37%</li>
<li><strong>Apple Safari:</strong> 5.69%</li>
<li><strong>Mozilla Firefox:</strong> 4.93%</li>
</ul>
<p>While Microsoft Edge holds onto a distant second place, both it and Safari saw notable drops. Perhaps most significantly, this new data shows Mozilla’s Firefox slipping below the 5% mark for the first time in a long while.</p><div>

<h2>Winning in the new AI era</h2>
<p>This surge in market share comes right on the heels of Chrome’s biggest-ever AI update. The recent rollout of <strong>Gemini in Chrome,</strong> the smarter <strong>AI Mode</strong> in the omnibox, and the promise of new <strong>agentic capabilities</strong> have transformed the browser into a more proactive and intelligent tool.</p>
<p>While other browsers are also adding their own AI features, it seems Google’s deep integration and powerful models are helping to not just maintain but accelerate Chrome’s dominance. With its market share now approaching three-quarters of the entire desktop browser landscape, Google Chrome is truly in a league of its own. </p>

<p>Amidst all the exciting new first-party hardware announced at Google’s smart home event today, one of the most strategically important pieces of news was a fundamental shift in philosophy. Google has announced that it is <strong>opening up its Nest camera platform and all of its new Gemini features to third-party hardware makers.</strong></p>
<p>And this new era of openness is kicking off with a bang. The first partner in this new program is Walmart’s Onn brand, which is launching a new indoor camera with full Nest-level integration for the shockingly low price of just <strong>$22.96.</strong></p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>A new ‘Built for Google Home’ vision</h2>
<p>This is a massive and very welcome move away from the “walled garden” approach. Google stated that the best Gemini for Home experience “shouldn’t be limited to just one brand, form factor or price point,” signaling a new commitment to giving consumers more choice in their smart home hardware.</p>
<h2>Nest features at Wyze prices</h2>
<p>The first two products in this new partnership are available starting today, and their prices are incredibly aggressive.</p><div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Walmart Onn Indoor Camera Wired:</strong> <strong>$22.96</strong></li>
<li><strong>Walmart Onn Video Doorbell Wired:</strong> <strong>$49.86</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The most important part of this announcement is the level of integration. These are not just “Works with Google Home” devices. They will feature full, deep integration, meaning you’ll set them up and control them entirely within the Google Home app.</p>
<p>Even more impressively, they will have access to all the same core features as first-party Nest Cams, including the powerful <strong>new Gemini camera features</strong> (like AI Descriptions and Home Brief) and cloud video recording via the new <strong>Google Home Premium</strong> subscription. <strong>It’s a “Nest-level experience at a Wyze-level price,” and it’s a huge win for consumers.</strong></p>

These first two Onn cameras are available today, and Google says this is just the beginning of wider partnerships to come.</p><div>

<p>Alongside all the <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/google-unveils-new-2k-nest-cams-and-the-google-home-speaker-built-for-gemini/" target="_blank">new hardware</a> and the powerful <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/googles-new-gemini-for-home-is-a-brilliant-ai-upgrade-but-the-best-features-will-cost-you/" target="_blank">new Gemini for Home</a> intelligence, Google is rolling out the final, crucial piece of its smart home revitalization: a completely <strong>rebuilt and redesigned Google Home app.</strong> Based on user feedback, Google rebuilt the app from the ground up with three primary goals in mind: make it faster, more reliable, and finally, complete. This is the app that’s built to handle the new, powerful Gemini for Home experience, and it’s rolling out globally starting today.</p>
<h2>Finally, a fast and reliable foundation</h2>
<p>The number one piece of feedback Google heard from users was that before adding any new AI features, the app simply needed to be fast and reliable. This was Google’s top priority in the redesign, and the results are impressive.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>According to Google, the new app now loads significantly faster—<strong>over 70% faster on some Android devices</strong>—and app crashes are <strong>down by nearly 80%</strong> from just a few months ago. For camera users, live views now load <strong>30% faster,</strong> and scrolling through your video history is far smoother with a more than 6x higher frame rate. This is the stable, responsive foundation many of us have been waiting for.</p>
<h2>The best of the Nest app is now in one place</h2>
<p>The second goal was to create a truly unified app, and that meant finally bringing the best of the Nest app into the Google Home experience. With this new update, you’ll no longer need to switch between apps. Full support for your core Nest devices and features is now here, including:</p><div>
<h2>Featured Videos</h2>
</div>
<div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>All <strong>Nest Thermostat</strong> models since 2015, with features like schedules.</li>
<li>Emergency smoke and CO alerts for <strong>Nest Protect.</strong></li>
<li>Passcode management for the <strong>Nest x Yale Lock.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>A new design built for Gemini</h2>
<p>Finally, the app has been redesigned with a more intuitive layout that puts the power of Gemini at your fingertips. There’s a simplified <strong>three-tab layout</strong> (Home, Activity, Automations), and the <strong>“Ask Home”</strong> natural language command bar is now persistently accessible from the header as you move through the app. This makes it the central way to control devices, find camera clips, and even create complex automations just by describing what you want.</p>
<p>The camera experience has also been upgraded with rich, animated notification previews and new YouTube-like gestures, like double-tapping to fast-forward or rewind through your video history.</p>
<p>This is a massive and much-needed overhaul for the Google Home app. It’s faster, it’s unified, and it’s intelligently designed around the power of Gemini. The updates are starting to roll out globally today, so be sure to check your app for the new experience.</p><div>

<p>Finally, the app has been redesigned with a more intuitive layout that puts the power of Gemini at your fingertips.

<p>The camera experience has also been upgraded with rich, animated notification previews and new YouTube-like gestures, like double-tapping to fast-forward or rewind through your video history.</p>
<p>This is a massive and much-needed overhaul for the Google Home app. It’s faster, it’s unified, and it’s intelligently designed around the power of Gemini. The updates are starting to roll out globally today, so be sure to check your app for the new experience.</p><div>

<p>Alongside all the <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/google-unveils-new-2k-nest-cams-and-the-google-home-speaker-built-for-gemini/" target="_blank">new hardware</a> and the powerful <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/googles-new-gemini-for-home-is-a-brilliant-ai-upgrade-but-the-best-features-will-cost-you/" target="_blank">new Gemini for Home</a> intelligence, Google is rolling out the final, crucial piece of its smart home revitalization: a completely <strong>rebuilt and redesigned Google Home app.</strong> Based on user feedback, Google rebuilt the app from the ground up with three primary goals in mind: make it faster, more reliable, and finally, complete. This is the app that’s built to handle the new, powerful Gemini for Home experience, and it’s rolling out globally starting today.</p>
<h2>Finally, a fast and reliable foundation</h2>
<p>The number one piece of feedback Google heard from users was that before adding any new AI features, the app simply needed to be fast and reliable. This was Google’s top priority in the redesign, and the results are impressive.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>According to Google, the new app now loads significantly faster—<strong>over 70% faster on some Android devices</strong>—and app crashes are <strong>down by nearly 80%</strong> from just a few months ago. For camera users, live views now load <strong>30% faster,</strong> and scrolling through your video history is far smoother with a more than 6x higher frame rate. This is the stable, responsive foundation many of us have been waiting for.</p>
<h2>The best of the Nest app is now in one place</h2>
<p>The second goal was to create a truly unified app, and that meant finally bringing the best of the Nest app into the Google Home experience. With this new update, you’ll no longer need to switch between apps. Full support for your core Nest devices and features is now here, including:</p><div>

<p>While the new hardware was the star of today’s Google smart home event, the real story is the software that powers it all. Google has officially detailed <strong>Gemini for Home,</strong> a new “foundational intelligence” that will replace the Google Assistant and fundamentally upgrade the smarts of your entire home ecosystem, from your speakers to your cameras to the Google Home app itself.</p>
<p>This is a massive leap forward, moving beyond a simple, transactional voice assistant to a truly collaborative and conversational AI partner for your home.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>A more natural conversation with your home</h2>
<p>The most immediate change you’ll notice is in how you talk to your home. Gemini for Home introduces 10 new, more natural-sounding voices and, more importantly, a far better understanding of human conversation.</p>
<p>It can now <strong>maintain conversational context,</strong> so you don’t have to repeat yourself. If you ask about troubleshooting your dishwasher, your follow-up questions will be understood in that same context. It can also now handle <strong>complex requests with exceptions,</strong> a huge user request. You can finally say things like, “Hey Google, turn off all the lights, except for the office lights,” and it will just work. This new level of understanding extends to everything from finding a song based on a vague movie description to adding all the ingredients for a recipe to your shopping list with a single command.</p><div>

</div>
<div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>Your cameras finally get a brain</h2>
<p>One of the most significant upgrades is how Gemini transforms your smart cameras from simple motion detectors into interpreters that can understand what they’re seeing. It’s the difference between a generic “person detected” alert and a truly helpful notification that says, <strong>“a USPS delivery driver is placing a package on the porch.”</strong> This new intelligence unlocks three powerful new camera features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Descriptions:</strong> More detailed, narrative notifications that tell you the full story behind an alert.</li>
<li><strong>Home Brief:</strong> An automatic, digestible summary of your day’s important events, complete with relevant video clips, delivered each evening.</li>
<li><strong>Ask Home for Video History:</strong> You can now search your entire video history with natural language, asking things like, “Did I leave the car door open?”</li>
</ul>
<h2>‘Ask Home’ makes automation easy for everyone</h2>
<p>This new natural language understanding is also coming to the Google Home app with a feature called <strong>Ask Home.</strong> While you can use it to control devices, its most powerful new capability is creating automations. What was once a niche, power-user feature is now accessible to everyone. You can simply describe what you want in plain English—like <strong>“Create an automation to turn on the porch lights and lock the front door every day at sunset”</strong>—and Gemini will build it for you.</p>
<h2>How you’ll get it (and what it will cost)</h2>
<p>This is a massive update, and Google is rolling it out in a few different ways. The entire experience will begin with an <strong>early access program</strong> that you can sign up for in your Google Home app settings, with the rollout starting this month. Here’s how the features break down:</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Free Upgrade:</strong> The core <strong>Gemini for Home voice assistant</strong>—the more conversational, better-understanding AI with new voices—will be a <strong>free upgrade</strong> that replaces the Google Assistant on your existing speakers and displays.</li>
<li><strong>The Paid Subscription:</strong> The most advanced, proactive features will require a new <strong>Google Home Premium subscription</strong> starting at <strong>$10/month.</strong> This includes <strong>Gemini Live,</strong> all the new <strong>AI camera features</strong> (AI Descriptions, Home Brief, Ask Home for video), and the ability to <strong>create automations with Ask Home.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a huge and ambitious new chapter for the Google Home ecosystem. While the new subscription model is a significant change, the sheer power and utility of these new Gemini features make this the most exciting development for Google’s smart home in years.</p>

      <![CDATA[<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/chromeunboxed.com-fdc50efacd.webp">
<p>Today, Google made good on its promise to reinvest in the Nest ecosystem. The company just unveiled a whole new portfolio of devices built from the ground up for the new Gemini for Home experience, including three new <strong>2K Nest Cams and a Doorbell,</strong> and the brand-new <strong>Google Home Speaker.</strong></p>
<h2>New Nest Cams and Doorbell get a 2K Gemini-powered upgrade</h2>
<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/storage.googleapis.com-f85eb5277f.webp">
<p>The entire wired camera lineup has received a massive and much-needed hardware refresh. The new <strong>Nest Cam Indoor (3rd gen), Nest Cam Outdoor (2nd gen), and Nest Doorbell (wired, 3rd gen)</strong> all now feature <strong>2K HDR video,</strong> delivering the best image quality ever on a Nest camera.<sup></sup></p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>On top of the resolution bump, the new cameras also feature wider fields of view and greatly improved low-light performance thanks to new sensors.<sup></sup> This upgraded hardware is what unlocks the new, powerful Gemini for Home camera features, including more detailed notifications (like “dog jumps out of playpen”), the ability to search your video history with natural language (“What happened to the vase in the living room?”), and “Home Brief,” which summarizes hours of footage into a quick, digestible summary.<sup></sup></p>
<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/storage.googleapis.com-29cfd8cbc1.webp">
<p>Even better, Google is improving the features that are included right out of the box with no subscription required. All the new cameras now come with <strong>six hours of event video history,</strong> doubling the three hours offered on the previous generation.<sup></sup></p><div>

<p>Today, Google made good on its promise to reinvest in the Nest ecosystem. The company just unveiled a whole new portfolio of devices built from the ground up for the new Gemini for Home experience, including three new <strong>2K Nest Cams and a Doorbell,</strong> and the brand-new <strong>Google Home Speaker.</strong></p>
<h2>New Nest Cams and Doorbell get a 2K Gemini-powered upgrade</h2>
<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/storage.googleapis.com-f85eb5277f.webp">
<p>The entire wired camera lineup has received a massive and much-needed hardware refresh. The new <strong>Nest Cam Indoor (3rd gen), Nest Cam Outdoor (2nd gen), and Nest Doorbell (wired, 3rd gen)</strong> all now feature <strong>2K HDR video,</strong> delivering the best image quality ever on a Nest camera.<sup></sup></p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>On top of the resolution bump, the new cameras also feature wider fields of view and greatly improved low-light performance thanks to new sensors.<sup></sup> This upgraded hardware is what unlocks the new, powerful Gemini for Home camera features, including more detailed notifications (like “dog jumps out of playpen”), the ability to search your video history with natural language (“What happened to the vase in the living room?”), and “Home Brief,” which summarizes hours of footage into a quick, digestible summary.<sup></sup></p>
<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/storage.googleapis.com-29cfd8cbc1.webp">
<p>Even better, Google is improving the features that are included right out of the box with no subscription required. All the new cameras now come with <strong>six hours of event video history,</strong> doubling the three hours offered on the previous generation.<sup></sup></p><div>

<p>Ransomware is one of the most terrifying and destructive threats on the modern web. The idea that a malicious actor could encrypt all your important files and hold them hostage is a nightmare for both individuals and businesses. <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/09/ransomware-detection-file-restoration-google-drive.html" target="_blank">In a fantastic new update,</a> Google is rolling out two powerful new features for Google Drive, currently in beta, designed to detect a ransomware attack and help you recover your files with ease.</p>
<h2>How the new protection works</h2>
<p>The new system works with a smart, two-pronged approach for users of Google Drive for desktop. First is <strong>Ransomware detection.</strong> Drive will now monitor for suspicious activity on your computer. If it detects a potential ransomware attack in progress, it will automatically <strong>pause all file syncing.</strong> This is a crucial first step, as it quarantines the threat and prevents the encrypted, malicious files from overwriting the clean versions stored in your cloud. The user and their Workspace administrator will be notified immediately.</p><div>

</div>
<p>The second part is a new, user-friendly <strong>File restoration</strong> tool. In the event of an attack, this new interface allows a user to select multiple files at once and easily restore them to a clean, unencrypted version from a specific point in time <em>before</em> the attack happened. This gives users a powerful way to recover their data without having to consider paying a ransom.</p>

<h2>Who gets these new features?</h2>
<p>This is the most important part of the announcement. The powerful new <strong>file restoration</strong> tool will be available to <strong>all Google Drive users,</strong> including those with personal Google accounts and Workspace Individual subscribers. This is a massive win for everyone.</p><div>

<p>The proactive <strong>ransomware detection</strong> feature, however, will be limited to users on specific <strong>Google Workspace</strong> business and education plans, including Business Standard/Plus and Enterprise tiers.</p>
<p>These new features are a fantastic and much-needed security upgrade for Google Drive. The admin controls are rolling out now, and the detection and restoration tools will begin their gradual roll-out to end-users on <strong>October 14, 2025.</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/you-can-now-start-gemini-conversations-right-in-google-drive-about-specific-files/" target="_blank">“Collaborate with Gemini” feature in Google Drive</a> for the web is an incredibly powerful tool. The ability to have a conversation with your files—summarizing documents, synthesizing information across folders, and pulling out quick facts—has been a game-changer for research and productivity. But up until now, that power has been a desktop-only experience.</p>
<p>That’s finally changing. In a new post on the Workspace Updates blog, Google has announced that it is now <strong>extending Gemini’s full capabilities to the Google Drive apps for both Android and iOS.</strong></p><div>

<h2>Your AI research assistant, now on the go</h2>
<p>This is a fantastic update that makes Gemini in Drive a far more versatile and useful tool. The same powerful, conversational AI that can analyze your files and folders on the web is now available right on your phone, allowing you to be productive and find information no matter where you are. With this new mobile integration, you can use Gemini to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summarize a long document or an entire folder</strong> to quickly get the main points while you’re on the go.</li>
<li><strong>Discuss a topic</strong> by asking questions that require synthesizing information from multiple files in your Drive.</li>
<li><strong>Retrieve quick facts</strong> about a project or topic without having to manually hunt for and read through the relevant documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a much-needed update that brings one of Drive’s best AI features to the mobile apps where so many of us do our work. The feature is part of an extended roll-out that began on September 22nd, so it should be appearing for eligible users soon. It’s available to most paid Workspace subscribers, <strong>Google AI Pro for Education</strong> users, and <strong>Google One AI Premium</strong> subscribers.</p><div>

<p>We are just weeks away from the official arrival of the new Pixel Watch 4, which is expected to start shipping in October. And as we all know, the arrival of a new generation of hardware means one very exciting thing: <strong>it’s the beginning of deal season for the still-excellent last-gen model.</strong></p>
<p>Right on cue, Walmart has dropped a fantastic sale on the <strong>Google Pixel Watch 3, with some models seeing discounts of up to $150.</strong> This is one of the first big price drops we’ve seen as retailers begin to clear out stock, and it’s a great opportunity to pick up a top-tier wearable for a fantastic price.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>Why the Pixel Watch 3 is still a great buy</h2>
<p>While the Pixel Watch 4 will surely bring some nice upgrades, the Pixel Watch 3 is a mature, polished, and all-around fantastic Wear OS device. It’s a beautiful watch with smooth performance, deep integration with the Pixel ecosystem, and best-in-class health and fitness tracking thanks to its Fitbit integration. It will continue to be supported with software updates for years to come, and at a steep discount, it offers incredible value.</p>
<h2>The deal at Walmart</h2>
<p>The sale at Walmart is a bit of a mix-and-match situation, so the final discount will depend on the specific configuration and color you’re looking for. You’ll want to click through the link below and check the prices on the size (41mm or 45mm), color, and connectivity (Wi-Fi or LTE) that you’re interested in. With savings of up to $150 on some of the higher-end models, <strong>you can snag a flagship wearable for a mid-range price.</strong></p><div>

<p>The pace of AI feature roll-outs in Google Workspace has been relentless, and the latest update brings a massive upgrade to the creative tools in both <strong>Google Slides and Google Vids.</strong> A new, more powerful image editing model is here, and with it comes the much-anticipated ability to edit your images using custom, natural language prompts.</p>
<h2>A more powerful AI model under the hood</h2>
<p>First up, the underlying AI is getting a big power-up. Google is upgrading the image editing capabilities in Slides and Vids to its latest model, codenamed <strong>“Nano Banana.”</strong> This is the same state-of-the-art model that recently brought huge improvements to image editing in the main Gemini app, known for its higher-quality outputs and better character consistency.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>Edit images with your words</h2>
<p>The most exciting part of this update is the new feature this model unlocks: <strong>custom prompting.</strong> Instead of being limited to pre-set options and filters, you can now select any image in your presentation or video project, click “Edit image,” and simply type a description of the changes you want to make.</p>
<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/blogger.googleusercontent.com-7d35395ec5.gif">
<p>Google gives the perfect example: you can ask Gemini to <strong>“Place this product in a New York subway station,”</strong> and it will generate a new image with that background, which you can then insert directly into your slide. This is a massive leap forward in creative control, moving beyond simple tweaks to a truly open-ended editing experience right where you work.</p><div>

<p>The pace of AI feature roll-outs in Google Workspace has been relentless, and the latest update brings a massive upgrade to the creative tools in both <strong>Google Slides and Google Vids.</strong> A new, more powerful image editing model is here, and with it comes the much-anticipated ability to edit your images using custom, natural language prompts.</p>
<h2>A more powerful AI model under the hood</h2>
<p>First up, the underlying AI is getting a big power-up. Google is upgrading the image editing capabilities in Slides and Vids to its latest model, codenamed <strong>“Nano Banana.”</strong> This is the same state-of-the-art model that recently brought huge improvements to image editing in the main Gemini app, known for its higher-quality outputs and better character consistency.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<h2>Edit images with your words</h2>
<p>The most exciting part of this update is the new feature this model unlocks: <strong>custom prompting.</strong> Instead of being limited to pre-set options and filters, you can now select any image in your presentation or video project, click “Edit image,” and simply type a description of the changes you want to make.</p>
<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/blogger.googleusercontent.com-7d35395ec5.gif">
<p>Google gives the perfect example: you can ask Gemini to <strong>“Place this product in a New York subway station,”</strong> and it will generate a new image with that background, which you can then insert directly into your slide. This is a massive leap forward in creative control, moving beyond simple tweaks to a truly open-ended editing experience right where you work.</p><div>

<p>For the past decade, Google’s iconic, flat, four-color “G” has been a ubiquitous symbol across the web and our devices. It’s been a clean, simple, and instantly recognizable mark for the company. But as Google continues its massive shift into the new era of AI, its most prominent logo is now getting a refresh to match.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/gradient-g-logo-design/" target="_blank">In a new blog post,</a> Google has announced that it is officially adopting its <strong>brighter, four-color gradient “G” as the new company-wide icon,</strong> representing all of Google’s brand and corporate identity.</p><div>

<h2>Symbolizing the AI era</h2>
<p>If the new logo looks familiar, it’s because you’ve likely already seen it. Google first introduced this brighter, gradient style earlier this year to represent Google Search, and a similar design language was used for the Gemini spark icon. Now, that new look is officially taking over.</p>
<p>According to Google, this isn’t just a simple design refresh; it’s a symbolic move to “visually reflect our evolution in the AI era.” The company explains that the <strong>“brighter hues and gradient design symbolize the surge of AI-driven innovation and creative energy”</strong> across all its products. It’s a clear and very public signal of Google’s full commitment to an AI-first future, baked right into its core branding.</p><div>

<h2>Rolling out everywhere soon</h2>
<p>This change will be a bit of a gradual one. Google says it will continue to update the logo across more of its products, platforms, and services over the coming months. So get ready to see this new, brighter, and more dynamic “G” start popping up in more and more places as Google updates its massive ecosystem to reflect its new, AI-powered identity.</p>

<p>After first being unveiled at IFA 2025 last month, Anker’s most powerful portable battery is now officially available for purchase. The new Anker Prime Power Bank (26k, 300W) is a true powerhouse designed for travelers or anyone like me with multiple power-hungry devices. And to celebrate the launch, Anker is offering a solid introductory discount for the next six days, <a href="https://anker.pxf.io/XmeaQg" target="_blank">dropping the price from its $229.99 MSRP to just <strong>$184.</strong></a></p>
<p>What makes this portable power bank special is that Anker has packed an incredible amount of power into a travel-friendly package. The 26,250mAh capacity translates to 99.75Wh, keeping it just under the TSA’s 100Wh limit for carry-on luggage. </p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>But the real headline is the power delivery. This bank has a total output of 300W, delivered through two USB-C ports capable of 140W each, plus an additional 22.5W USB-A port. In practical terms, that’s enough juice to fast-charge two power-hungry Chromebooks and a phone all at the same time.</p>

</svg>
</button>
<p>Just as impressively, those USB-C ports are bi-directional, allowing for a combined input of 250W. Anker claims this can take the battery from empty to 80% in just 35 minutes, which is a game-changer. You can monitor all this activity on the battery’s built-in screen or via the Anker mobile app. </p><div>

<p>Anker seriously continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible with portable power, and this new Prime Power Bank looks to be an absolute beast. If you’re interested in picking one up, be sure to grab it while the limited-time launch discount is still active!</p>

And to celebrate the launch, Anker is offering a solid introductory discount for the next six days, <a href="https://anker.pxf.io/XmeaQg" target="_blank">dropping the price from its $229.99 MSRP to just <strong>$184.</strong></a></p>
<p>What makes this portable power bank special is that Anker has packed an incredible amount of power into a travel-friendly package. The 26,250mAh capacity translates to 99.75Wh, keeping it just under the TSA’s 100Wh limit for carry-on luggage. </p><div>

</div>
<p>But the real headline is the power delivery. This bank has a total output of 300W, delivered through two USB-C ports capable of 140W each, plus an additional 22.5W USB-A port. In practical terms, that’s enough juice to fast-charge two power-hungry Chromebooks and a phone all at the same time.</p>

<p>Just as impressively, those USB-C ports are bi-directional, allowing for a combined input of 250W.

<p>Over the last several years, I’ve done almost all of my reading on my phone. It’s convenient, sure, but it’s far from an ideal experience. That’s why I’ve recently found myself seriously considering a dedicated e-reader, with the Kindle Paperwhite sitting at the top of my list as the standard, go-to option. But just as I was getting ready to pull the trigger, a new device from TCL has popped up that has piqued my interest!</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.tcl.com/us/en/products/mobile/tcl-tab/tab-8-nxtpaper-5g" target="_blank">TCL TAB 8 NXTPAPER 5G</a> isn’t trying to be just an e-reader. Instead, it’s a compact, full-fledged Android tablet built around a unique, eye-friendly display. And while my primary use for it would be reading, it’s that added flexibility and versatility that has me completely rethinking my purchase.</p><div>

<h2><strong>The perfect Kindle competitor</strong>?</h2>
<p>With its unique display and compact size, TCL is clearly positioning the Tab 8 as a more flexible alternative to color e-readers like the Kindle Colorsoft. And on paper, the advantages are clear. At <strong>$199.99,</strong> it’s significantly cheaper than the $280 Kindle. Its upgraded LCD panel offers far better color reproduction than the Kindle’s muted E Ink screen. </p>
<p>And most importantly, because it runs Android 15, you have access to the entire Google Play Store. You can read books from the Kindle app, Kobo, or your local library, then switch over to watch a YouTube video or browse the web—something no dedicated e-reader can do.</p>
<p>But to hit that compelling price point, there are some expected trade-offs. The tablet is powered by an unspecified octa-core processor with just <strong>4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage,</strong> which is on the low end for a modern Android device. This isn’t a tablet for high-end gaming or heavy multitasking.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>The other major trade-off is battery life.</strong> While TCL touts a respectable 16 hours of mixed usage from the 6,000mAh battery, that’s a far cry from the multi-week battery life of a dedicated e-reader. But that’s the core of the compromise: the Tab 8 does far more than an e-reader, so it naturally requires more power.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://www.verizon.com/tablets/tcl-tab-8-nxtpaper-5g/" target="_blank">$199.99 exclusively at Verizon</a> (coming soon to Total Wireless), the TCL TAB 8 NXTPAPER 5G is not trying to be the most powerful tablet on the market. Instead, it’s carving out a fascinating new niche for users like me who want a single, portable, and connected device for reading, light media consumption, and browsing, all with a strong focus on eye comfort. </p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/chromeunboxed.com-eb6928c286.webp">
<p>Over the last several years, I’ve done almost all of my reading on my phone. It’s convenient, sure, but it’s far from an ideal experience. That’s why I’ve recently found myself seriously considering a dedicated e-reader, with the Kindle Paperwhite sitting at the top of my list as the standard, go-to option. But just as I was getting ready to pull the trigger, a new device from TCL has popped up that has piqued my interest!</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.tcl.com/us/en/products/mobile/tcl-tab/tab-8-nxtpaper-5g" target="_blank">TCL TAB 8 NXTPAPER 5G</a> isn’t trying to be just an e-reader. Instead, it’s a compact, full-fledged Android tablet built around a unique, eye-friendly display. And while my primary use for it would be reading, it’s that added flexibility and versatility that has me completely rethinking my purchase.</p><div>

<h2><strong>A display that does things differently</strong></h2>
<p>The star of the show here is the 8.7-inch NXTPAPER 4.0 display. Unlike a standard glossy tablet screen, the glass is etched with a fine pattern, giving it a matte finish that dramatically reduces glare and reflections. </p>
<p>And with the press of a dedicated key, you can cycle the display through different modes: full color, a warmer reading mode with muted tones, and a fully monochromatic black-and-white mode that mimics the look of an e-ink screen.</p><div>

<h2><strong>The perfect Kindle competitor</strong>?</h2>
<p>With its unique display and compact size, TCL is clearly positioning the Tab 8 as a more flexible alternative to color e-readers like the Kindle Colorsoft. And on paper, the advantages are clear. At <strong>$199.99,</strong> it’s significantly cheaper than the $280 Kindle. Its upgraded LCD panel offers far better color reproduction than the Kindle’s muted E Ink screen. </p>
<p>And most importantly, because it runs Android 15, you have access to the entire Google Play Store. You can read books from the Kindle app, Kobo, or your local library, then switch over to watch a YouTube video or browse the web—something no dedicated e-reader can do.</p>
<p>But to hit that compelling price point, there are some expected trade-offs. The tablet is powered by an unspecified octa-core processor with just <strong>4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage,</strong> which is on the low end for a modern Android device. This isn’t a tablet for high-end gaming or heavy multitasking.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>The other major trade-off is battery life.</strong> While TCL touts a respectable 16 hours of mixed usage from the 6,000mAh battery, that’s a far cry from the multi-week battery life of a dedicated e-reader. But that’s the core of the compromise: the Tab 8 does far more than an e-reader, so it naturally requires more power.</p>

<p>Following their big debut at the Made by Google 2025 event, the exciting new software features for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are now <a href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/thread/375867777/pixel-buds-pro-2-what-s-included-in-the-latest-rollout?hl=en&amp;sjid=14406221014074194487-NC" target="_blank">officially rolling out.</a> A new firmware update <strong>(version 4.467)</strong> is beginning to arrive for users, and it’s a true Feature Drop, bringing a host of smart new capabilities that make Google’s flagship earbuds even better.</p>
<h2>Meet ‘Adaptive Audio’ and Loud Noise Protection</h2>
<p>The headline feature of this update is a brand-new noise control mode called <strong>Adaptive Audio.</strong> Sitting alongside the existing Noise Cancellation and Transparency modes, Adaptive Audio is an intelligent middle ground. It dynamically reduces the volume of unwanted, sustained background noises—like the hum of a metro or the clatter of a gym—while still keeping you aware of your immediate surroundings.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>When Adaptive Audio is active, it also enables <strong>Loud Noise Protection,</strong> a fantastic feature that automatically reduces the volume of sudden, loud sounds like a passing fire truck’s siren to help protect your hearing.</p>
<h2>Truly hands-free with new head gestures</h2>
<p>This update also introduces a truly hands-free way to interact with calls and texts. With new <strong>head gestures,</strong> you can now simply <strong>nod your head to answer an incoming call</strong> or reply to a text message, and <strong>shake your head to decline a call</strong> or dismiss the reply. It’s a brilliant addition for those moments when your hands are full. It is worth noting, however, that Google says this specific feature will be rolling out over the next few weeks, so it may not be available immediately after your firmware is updated.</p><div>

<h2>Clearer conversations with Gemini Live</h2>
<p>Finally, the update brings an improvement to your interactions with Gemini. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 will now use advanced audio processing to better prioritize your voice and eliminate background noise, ensuring your conversations with <strong>Gemini Live are clearer and more uninterrupted,</strong> even when you’re in a noisy environment.</p>
<p>This is a fantastic and feature-packed update that makes the Pixel Buds Pro 2 smarter and more capable than ever. The new firmware will roll out to all users automatically over time, but you can check for it manually in the Pixel Buds app by heading to <strong>More settings &gt; Firmware update</strong> and looking for version <strong>4.467.</strong></p>

It is worth noting, however, that Google says this specific feature will be rolling out over the next few weeks, so it may not be available immediately after your firmware is updated.</p><div>

<h2>Clearer conversations with Gemini Live</h2>
<p>Finally, the update brings an improvement to your interactions with Gemini. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 will now use advanced audio processing to better prioritize your voice and eliminate background noise, ensuring your conversations with <strong>Gemini Live are clearer and more uninterrupted,</strong> even when you’re in a noisy environment.</p>
<p>This is a fantastic and feature-packed update that makes the Pixel Buds Pro 2 smarter and more capable than ever. The new firmware will roll out to all users automatically over time, but you can check for it manually in the Pixel Buds app by heading to <strong>More settings &gt; Firmware update</strong> and looking for version <strong>4.467.</strong></p>

<p>While the ad-free experience is the main draw for most YouTube Premium subscribers, the service also comes with a host of other perks and experimental features designed to enhance your viewing experience. <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/376145315/bringing-our-latest-premium-features-to-more-places" target="_blank">In a new announcement,</a> YouTube has confirmed that several of these great features are now graduating from their experimental phase and expanding to more of the devices you use every day.</p>
<h2>Better viewing on the big screen and the web</h2>
<p>Some of the most exciting expansions are coming to the non-mobile YouTube experience. First up, the fantastic <strong>“Jump ahead”</strong> feature, which uses AI to let you seamlessly skip to the most interesting or relevant parts of a video, is now fully available on <strong>Smart TVs and Gaming Consoles.</strong> This is a huge quality-of-life improvement for the living room experience.</p><div>
<div><a href="/join"><span>X</span>remove ads</a></div>
</div>
<p>For those of you who watch on a desktop or Chromebook, the more granular <strong>faster playback speeds</strong> are now fully available on the <strong>web.</strong> This allows you to fine-tune playback up to 4x speed in precise 0.05 increments, a feature that was previously only available on mobile.</p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>“High-quality audio”</strong> option, which provides a richer listening experience for official music videos, is now a standard, fully available feature for both <strong>Android and iOS</strong> in the main YouTube app, graduating from its experimental status.</p><div>

<h2>New Shorts perks for iOS users</h2>
<p>Premium subscribers who use an iPhone are also getting a couple of great new features for Shorts, bringing the iOS app to parity with its Android counterpart. <strong>Shorts Smart Downloads,</strong> which automatically saves Shorts for offline viewing based on your watch history, is now fully available on iOS. Additionally, <strong>Shorts Picture-in-Picture (PiP)</strong> is also making its full debut, allowing you to keep a Short playing in a small window while you browse other content.</p>
<p>This is a great set of updates that adds even more value to the YouTube Premium subscription. It’s fantastic to see YouTube continuing to roll out thoughtful, useful perks for its paying members across all the different platforms we use to watch.</p>

<p>For many of us, writing complex spreadsheet formulas can feel like learning a new language. It can be an intimidating and frustrating process of trial and error. <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/09/smarter-natural-formula-generation-gemini-sheets.html" target="_blank">In a fantastic new update,</a> Google is making that process a whole lot easier by rolling out a significant upgrade to formula generation in Gemini for Sheets. This new version isn’t just smarter at writing formulas; <strong>it can now explain how they work and even fix them when they break.</strong></p>
<h2>Your personal AI formula tutor</h2>
<p>The first part of this upgrade turns Gemini into your personal formula tutor. Now, when you ask Gemini to generate a complex formula, it can also return a <strong>detailed, step-by-step explanation</strong> of how the formula works. This is a huge learning tool that helps you understand the logic behind the calculation, making it easier for you to trust the result and adapt the formula for future use.</p><div>

<h2>An AI that can explain and fix formula errors</h2>
<p>This next part is a game-changer for anyone who has ever stared at a <code>#REF!</code> or <code>#VALUE!</code> error in frustration. Gemini can now <strong>explain why a formula failed</strong> in plain, natural language (e.g., “the date in A1 is formatted as text”).</p>
<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/blogger.googleusercontent.com-6e2d181b28.gif">
<p>Even better, in a follow-up turn, it can use that error message to <strong>generate a corrected formula</strong> that solves the underlying issue. This interactive troubleshooting will save users a massive amount of time and headaches.</p><div>

<h2>More than one way to solve a problem</h2>
<p>Finally, for more complex tasks where there might be several ways to get the same result, Gemini can now provide you with <strong>multiple different formula options.</strong> This gives you more flexibility and control over how your spreadsheet works.</p>
<img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-Fulltext-20240420/file-cache/blogger.googleusercontent.com-e7b241871c.gif">
<p>This is a fantastic set of upgrades that makes Gemini in Sheets an even more powerful and accessible tool. The focus on not just generating formulas but also helping users understand and troubleshoot them is a brilliant move. The best part is this update is <strong>already available</strong> for all eligible users, which includes most paid Workspace subscribers, <strong>Google AI Pro for Education</strong> users, and <strong>Google AI Pro and Ultra</strong> subscribers.</p>

<p>Bryson DeChambeau is known as “The Scientist” of golf for a reason. He’s one of the biggest names in the sport, not just for his major wins, but for his relentless, methodical, and meticulous approach to optimizing every single aspect of his game. From custom-designed club heads to AI-powered biomechanics analysis, DeChambeau is always pushing the boundaries.</p>
<p>Now, he’s taking that pursuit to the next level by partnering with <strong>Google Cloud to explore how AI can revolutionize sports performance.</strong> And the goal isn’t just to help him; it’s to put that same advanced AI coaching power into the hands of every golfer.</p><div>

<h2>AI that can refine your swing in minutes</h2>
<p>DeChambeau has already been using an AI coaching tool that studies the finest points of his biomechanics. But the partnership with Google Cloud aims to expand these AI aspirations even further, with a specific focus on developing a version of this AI coach that could <strong>run on a smartphone.</strong></p>
<p>The vision is to provide near-instant, on-course feedback that can help golfers make real-time adjustments. As DeChambeau puts it, he’s “making interpretations and iterating on my golf swing with the data that’s presented to me, minutes before my tee time.” Imagine having that kind of precise, data-driven insight available instantly.</p><div>

<h2>Bringing complex AI to the masses</h2>
<p>This partnership highlights the incredible potential of Google Cloud’s AI to move beyond massive datasets and into personalized, on-demand applications. By leveraging Google’s powerful AI models, the goal is to take a technology that was once complex and exclusive and make it far more accessible.</p>
<p>While DeChambeau is applying this to his golf swing, the implications are huge. This kind of mobile, real-time AI coaching could be applied to virtually any sport or physical activity, democratizing access to expert-level analysis and feedback. It’s a fascinating collaboration that could fundamentally change how athletes of all levels train and perform.</p>
<p>You can learn more about this exciting partnership <a href="https://cloud.google.com/transform/the-ai-crusher-bryson-dechambeau-on-his-experiments-with-ai-and-the-future-of-sports-performance" target="_blank">on Google Cloud’s “Transform” blog</a> that showcases the initiative. It’s a great example of how cutting-edge AI can be applied to push the boundaries of human performance.</p><div>
