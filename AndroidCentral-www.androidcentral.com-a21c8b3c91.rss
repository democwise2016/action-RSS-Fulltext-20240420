      <![CDATA[<p>It's hard to believe we're already in new flagship phone season again, but Honor isn't wasting any time getting its new Magic 8 Pro ready for its domestic China launch this month. Honor sent me a pre-production unit ahead of the launch, and my hands-on impressions are based on that model.</p><p>This one is a China model running a global version of Honor's Magic OS 10 software, which is based on Android 16. It's got the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> silicon from Qualcomm, a cutting-edge camera system, a lovely, refined build that's lighter than ever, and the most massive battery I've ever seen in a flagship phone, despite the reduction in weight.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-pro-specs-pricing-and-availability"><span>Honor Magic 8 Pro: Specs, pricing, and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5DJ2dGcN8xPkq78sumyjtK" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-magic-os-10" alt="The Magic OS 10 update screen on an Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5DJ2dGcN8xPkq78sumyjtK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Honor Magic 8 Pro is launching in China in October 2025, debuting there first before it heads to international markets, including Europe, later this year in Sunrise Gold, Sky Cyan, and Black colorways.</p><p>The phone is available in a single 12GB RAM and 512GB storage SKU at launch with a 7,200mAh battery.  The European model will launch with a 6,270mAh battery, likely due to European battery size regulations.</p><p>In the box, Honor includes a pre-installed film screen protector on the phone, a clear TPU case, a 100W charger, and a USB cable.

The soft, brushed metal sides of the phone are not only smoother than ever (in a non-slippery way, weird as that sounds), but they also naturally curve into the front and back of the chassis, providing impressive weight relief compared to last year.</p><p>I don't like most phones with flat edges, but Honor seems to have struck a nice balance between the flat side trend and a more comfortable set of curves. The display is flatter than ever, only pushing the very edges of the corners into a curve.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mxboUo5a58cnT8MtZ2LyAW" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-camera-island-02" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Pro's textured camera island" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mxboUo5a58cnT8MtZ2LyAW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="g6z9i9XKD4M5DE3gVpn7BW" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-side" alt="The left side of the Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g6z9i9XKD4M5DE3gVpn7BW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8cQBpSJhMNDcgvfdke6pBW" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-camera-island-01" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Pro's camera island and camera sensors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8cQBpSJhMNDcgvfdke6pBW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qvS9Fef3YSRBJGhG8Yu87d" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-back-logo" alt="The back of the Sunrise Gold Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qvS9Fef3YSRBJGhG8Yu87d.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MZJYXq9H8H62phiCy9t3Cd" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-back-04" alt="The back of the Sunrise Gold Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MZJYXq9H8H62phiCy9t3Cd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>A new AI button is the marketed highlight of the new design, though it is located about two-thirds of the way down the right side of the phone. This long button is flush with the frame and primarily functions as an AI button out of the box, although it also works as a camera control button, including swipe-to-zoom functionality.</p><p>Long-pressing the button will activate the YOYO video AI functionality in China, with functionality that at least mirrors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> in some respects. International models will likely have this function with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> instead of YOYO, but Honor hasn't announced those plans yet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dhdxpUvjU8r9H8NrE2pEPd" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-ai-memories" alt="Searching for "Harry Potter" in the AI memories app on an Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dhdxpUvjU8r9H8NrE2pEPd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also customize a single or double press of this button to launch the AI memories center, launch the camera, or take a screenshot for storage in AI memories.</p><p>It's this last feature that I loved the most, as it made it easy to catalog information throughout my day. For example, as I was scrolling through Instagram, I saw a local post about a Harry Potter event happening at the end of the month. Tapping the AI button stored the screenshot of this event in my AI memories, and I can simply search for "Harry Potter" in the AI memories app to find it.</p><p>This sort of context-sensitive information searching is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots app</a> and is my favorite way to find information these days. On the Chinese models, you can even ask YOYO to "find all my screenshots and delete the blurry ones." The implementation here doesn't feel overbearing at all and is completely ignorable if you don't want to use it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="njhnDQraZJh9ttghLaQkDj" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-display-outdoor-visibility" alt="Zooming in on a macro photo of a flower, which was taken with the Honor Magic 8 Pro's camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/njhnDQraZJh9ttghLaQkDj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even if you don't care at all about the new AI button, you <em>will</em> care about the new battery. The Magic 8 Pro packs in the largest battery I've ever seen in a traditional flagship phone, sporting Honor's latest silicon-carbon battery tech that boasts an unbelievable 7,100mAh capacity, and yet the phone weighs less than last year's despite the capacity upgrade.</p><p>This battery tech <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/electric-car-battery-tech-will-supercharge-your-next-smartphone">was in the Honor Magic V5</a>, and it also boasted a similar capacity upgrade. I went two full days without charging and still had just under 20% left at the start of the third day in my testing so far, so this isn't "empty capacity" or something. It's the real deal.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-pro-holy-smokes-this-camera"><span>Honor Magic 8 Pro: Holy smokes this camera</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="K9txp2Du9LVF6zLFUtkc6" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-camera-flowers" alt="Taking a photo of pink mums with the Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K9txp2Du9LVF6zLFUtkc6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I took the Honor Magic 8 Pro out for a fall fun day and was impressed with every shot I took. As I've come to expect from Honor phones, this one does particularly well when using portrait mode, capturing motion, or using the telephoto camera. Even Honor's more affordable phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-400-pro-camera-review-passing-the-test-with-full-honors">take stunning portrait mode shots</a>, so it's no surprise to see that elevated here with even better sensors.</p><p>Photos taken using any of the 2x, 3.7x, or 10x presets in the viewfinder are exceptional. Every scenario I put the camera through delivered excellent results, and I'm not sure I can expect more from any camera in the under 10x zoom range.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

      <![CDATA[<p>It's hard to believe we're already in new flagship phone season again, but Honor isn't wasting any time getting its new Magic 8 Pro ready for its domestic China launch this month. Honor sent me a pre-production unit ahead of the launch, and my hands-on impressions are based on that model.</p><p>This one is a China model running a global version of Honor's Magic OS 10 software, which is based on Android 16. It's got the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> silicon from Qualcomm, a cutting-edge camera system, a lovely, refined build that's lighter than ever, and the most massive battery I've ever seen in a flagship phone, despite the reduction in weight.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-pro-specs-pricing-and-availability"><span>Honor Magic 8 Pro: Specs, pricing, and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5DJ2dGcN8xPkq78sumyjtK" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-magic-os-10" alt="The Magic OS 10 update screen on an Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5DJ2dGcN8xPkq78sumyjtK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Honor Magic 8 Pro is launching in China in October 2025, debuting there first before it heads to international markets, including Europe, later this year in Sunrise Gold, Sky Cyan, and Black colorways.</p><p>The phone is available in a single 12GB RAM and 512GB storage SKU at launch with a 7,200mAh battery.

The soft, brushed metal sides of the phone are not only smoother than ever (in a non-slippery way, weird as that sounds), but they also naturally curve into the front and back of the chassis, providing impressive weight relief compared to last year.</p><p>I don't like most phones with flat edges, but Honor seems to have struck a nice balance between the flat side trend and a more comfortable set of curves.

This long button is flush with the frame and primarily functions as an AI button out of the box, although it also works as a camera control button, including swipe-to-zoom functionality.</p><p>Long-pressing the button will activate the YOYO video AI functionality in China, with functionality that at least mirrors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> in some respects. International models will likely have this function with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> instead of YOYO, but Honor hasn't announced those plans yet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dhdxpUvjU8r9H8NrE2pEPd" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-ai-memories" alt="Searching for "Harry Potter" in the AI memories app on an Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dhdxpUvjU8r9H8NrE2pEPd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also customize a single or double press of this button to launch the AI memories center, launch the camera, or take a screenshot for storage in AI memories.</p><p>It's this last feature that I loved the most, as it made it easy to catalog information throughout my day. For example, as I was scrolling through Instagram, I saw a local post about a Harry Potter event happening at the end of the month. Tapping the AI button stored the screenshot of this event in my AI memories, and I can simply search for "Harry Potter" in the AI memories app to find it.</p><p>This sort of context-sensitive information searching is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots app</a> and is my favorite way to find information these days. On the Chinese models, you can even ask YOYO to "find all my screenshots and delete the blurry ones."

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's hard to believe we're already in new flagship phone season again, but Honor isn't wasting any time getting its new Magic 8 Pro ready for its domestic China launch this month. Honor sent me a pre-production unit ahead of the launch, and my hands-on impressions are based on that model.</p><p>This one is a China model running a global version of Honor's Magic OS 10 software, which is based on Android 16. It's got the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> silicon from Qualcomm, a cutting-edge camera system, a lovely, refined build that's lighter than ever, and the most massive battery I've ever seen in a flagship phone, despite the reduction in weight.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-pro-specs-pricing-and-availability"><span>Honor Magic 8 Pro: Specs, pricing, and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5DJ2dGcN8xPkq78sumyjtK" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-magic-os-10" alt="The Magic OS 10 update screen on an Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5DJ2dGcN8xPkq78sumyjtK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Honor Magic 8 Pro is launching in China in October 2025, debuting there first before it heads to international markets, including Europe, later this year in Sunrise Gold, Sky Cyan, and Black colorways.</p><p>The phone is available in a single 12GB RAM and 512GB storage SKU at launch with a 7,200mAh battery.

International models will likely have this function with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> instead of YOYO, but Honor hasn't announced those plans yet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dhdxpUvjU8r9H8NrE2pEPd" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-ai-memories" alt="Searching for "Harry Potter" in the AI memories app on an Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dhdxpUvjU8r9H8NrE2pEPd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also customize a single or double press of this button to launch the AI memories center, launch the camera, or take a screenshot for storage in AI memories.</p><p>It's this last feature that I loved the most, as it made it easy to catalog information throughout my day. For example, as I was scrolling through Instagram, I saw a local post about a Harry Potter event happening at the end of the month. Tapping the AI button stored the screenshot of this event in my AI memories, and I can simply search for "Harry Potter" in the AI memories app to find it.</p><p>This sort of context-sensitive information searching is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots app</a> and is my favorite way to find information these days. On the Chinese models, you can even ask YOYO to "find all my screenshots and delete the blurry ones." The implementation here doesn't feel overbearing at all and is completely ignorable if you don't want to use it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="njhnDQraZJh9ttghLaQkDj" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-display-outdoor-visibility" alt="Zooming in on a macro photo of a flower, which was taken with the Honor Magic 8 Pro's camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/njhnDQraZJh9ttghLaQkDj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even if you don't care at all about the new AI button, you <em>will</em> care about the new battery. The Magic 8 Pro packs in the largest battery I've ever seen in a traditional flagship phone, sporting Honor's latest silicon-carbon battery tech that boasts an unbelievable 7,100mAh capacity, and yet the phone weighs less than last year's despite the capacity upgrade.</p><p>This battery tech <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/electric-car-battery-tech-will-supercharge-your-next-smartphone">was in the Honor Magic V5</a>, and it also boasted a similar capacity upgrade. I went two full days without charging and still had just under 20% left at the start of the third day in my testing so far, so this isn't "empty capacity" or something. It's the real deal.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-pro-holy-smokes-this-camera"><span>Honor Magic 8 Pro: Holy smokes this camera</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="K9txp2Du9LVF6zLFUtkc6" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-camera-flowers" alt="Taking a photo of pink mums with the Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K9txp2Du9LVF6zLFUtkc6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I took the Honor Magic 8 Pro out for a fall fun day and was impressed with every shot I took. As I've come to expect from Honor phones, this one does particularly well when using portrait mode, capturing motion, or using the telephoto camera. Even Honor's more affordable phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-400-pro-camera-review-passing-the-test-with-full-honors">take stunning portrait mode shots</a>, so it's no surprise to see that elevated here with even better sensors.</p><p>Photos taken using any of the 2x, 3.7x, or 10x presets in the viewfinder are exceptional. Every scenario I put the camera through delivered excellent results, and I'm not sure I can expect more from any camera in the under 10x zoom range.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

For instance, when liking a music video, the platform states users may see the Like button light up with a music note.</p><p>Videos about sports are also expected to get a similar treatment.</p><p>YouTube states these updates are rolling out across all devices this week, so users should begin noticing them soon.</p><p>The platform's been busy behind the scenes, more so after it announced that users can now join "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-labs-wants-you-to-test-the-future-of-ai-starting-with-music">YouTube Labs</a>." This labs experience is reminiscent of Search Labs from Google, where testers can join and experiment with its in-development AI features before it hits a stable launch. The first YouTube Labs test is out, and brings users into a YouTube Music test for "AI music hosts."</p>]]></content:encoded>

If you remember, its predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-fold-durability-test-woes">snapped in half</a>, and this time around, things just got worse.</p><p>At first, things seemed as usual. Pixel 10 Pro Fold's cover screen (Gorilla Glass Victus 2) got scratches, on level 6 of the Mohs Hardness Scale, and 'deeper grooves' at level seven, much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-changed-my-mind-about-foldables-but-i-still-prefer-flip-phones">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VCf2vReryTS9cFi53N6EUD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-impressions-6" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold on Pixelsnap charger with screen open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VCf2vReryTS9cFi53N6EUD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The inner screen can be scratched with something as simple as a fingernail (a good reason to invest in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-screen-protectors">Pixel 10 Pro Fold screen protector</a>), but the good news is that the inner screen is protected when folded, so you don't really have to worry about accidental nicks. He also scraped the outer rims of the phone, which made the color coating come off.</p><p>Following this was the dust-resistance test, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold prides itself on being the first smartphone to get an IP68 dust and water resistance. After throwing some sand and dust on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's inner screen, Nelson says the screen is definitely dust-proof. However, the phone's hinge didn't handle the sand well, with particles crunching within it.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uS90jakOuw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Nelson also put the phone through his usual burn test; however, things get interesting when he gets to the bend test. Google says that its 10 Pro Fold can handle a decade's worth of folding inward, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/engineering-behind-pixel-10-pro-fold-hinge">its redesigned hinge mechanism</a>. However, much like last year, the phone snapped in half when folded the opposite way; however, it didn't break at the hinge but along the antenna lines on the left side of the phone.</p><p>Nelson noted how he wanted Google to change the placement of these antenna lines this time around and criticized the tech giant every chance he got for leaving them in the same place.</p><p>That said, things get worse for this foldable when Nelson tried to bend the device even more after it snapped, with the phone smoking up and essentially exploding on camera.</p><p>"The battery decides itâs had enough. Surprisingly, in the decade that Iâve been durability testing phones, I have never had a smartphone explode before,â Nelson added. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold became the first-ever phone to go up in smoke in his videos, and fails the durability test "catastrophically." But despite one side of the device being charred, Nelson continued to test the device's other panel with the camera array.</p><p>That said, we should note that if your phone is noticeably or excessively bent, you should stop using it and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/magazine/repaircenter?hl=en-US">have it checked out</a> before things get worse.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Released in 2015, this operating system introduced a dramatic shift away from the "Metro" interface of Windows 8 and 8.1. It's also been regularly maintained despite Windows 11's introduction in 2011, with millions of users still relying on it for their daily computing needs.</p><p>So, with Microsoft ending the chapter on Windows 10, what does that actually mean? For starters, it's not like your laptop or computer will just stop working altogether. Those with compatible computers will likely eventually upgrade to Windows 11, but what if your computer doesn't meet the requirements? Well, you're in luck, as you can install ChromeOS Flex and not worry about buying something brand new when your current laptop works fine.</p><h2 id="what-is-chromeos-flex-2">What is ChromeOS Flex</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="rHKWqM4dXR3ZAb5VjozRci" name="install-chromeos-flex-screen" alt="Install or try out ChromeOS Flex during the initial setup process" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rHKWqM4dXR3ZAb5VjozRci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chrome-os-flex">ChromeOS Flex</a> has been around for quite some time, as it was originally known as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-try-chromeos-virtual-machine-you-buy-chromebook">CloudReady</a> and was developed by Neverware. It allowed you to install and use a modified version of ChromeOS on a virtual machine, adding a layer of versatility to your computing arsenal. Back in 2020, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-just-bought-neverware-makers-free-cloudready-upgrade">Google acquired Neverware</a>, before eventually re-releasing and rebranding CloudReady as ChromeOS Flex.</p><p>In doing so, Google also announced that it was making it possible to install ChromeOS Flex on select laptops and computers as a way to replace whatever current operating system you were running. This list has continued to expand over the years, as there are now thousands of laptops and computers that are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=16143057431931141904-NA">Certified to work</a> with the platform.

See, while you'll still be able to use Windows 10 on your computer, technically, until the end of time, there are a couple of problems that could arise. Arguably, the most important thing is that you'll no longer receive regular security updates, which could leave your computer open to malware and viruses due to vulnerabilities in the software.</p><p>Although you could rely on third-party apps to help keep your Windows 10 machine as virus-free as possible, there's another issue that lies ahead. There's a pretty good chance that whatever app or service you decide to use will eventually drop support for Windows 10 machines, putting you right back at square one.</p><div><blockquote><p>You don't have to worry about viruses on ChromeOS Flex. </p></blockquote></div><p>By installing ChromeOS Flex, there's a good chance you'll be able to extend the life of your machine for at least a few more years. In some instances, the Windows 10 laptop you're currently using could have its lifespan extended by another six or seven years with ChromeOS Flex. Not to mention that it's <em>almost</em> impossible to get a virus on ChromeOS or ChromeOS Flex, with the only real threat coming in the form of installing rogue or nefarious Chrome extensions.</p><h2 id="replace-windows-10-with-chromeos-flex-2">Replace Windows 10 with ChromeOS Flex</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5013px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bq3EQxMrgCdfurPuTri3LB" name="android-tablet-ui-on-surface-pro-11" alt="Android tablet UI on Microsoft Surface Pro 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bq3EQxMrgCdfurPuTri3LB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5013" height="2820" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the best things about ChromeOS Flex is that it's extremely simple to install. We've already written a complete <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-install-chromeos-flex">ChromeOS Flex install guide</a> for you to follow, but here are the cliff notes:</p><ul><li>Backup all of your important files and documents either to the cloud (i.e., Google Drive) or an external drive.</li><li>Verify that your laptop/computer is supported</li><li>Install the Chromebook Recovery Utility from the Chrome Web Store.</li><li>Use a USB drive and follow the steps to install the ChromeOS Flex image.</li><li>Boot your computer from the USB.</li><li>Install ChromeOS Flex.</li><li>Enjoy!</li></ul><p>The prospect of installing a new operating system on your laptop or computer might seem daunting, but as long as you follow the steps, it's really pretty easy. If anything, I'd recommend looking up how to boot from a USB, as some computers rely on a boot menu, while others require you to enter the BIOS in order to change the boot order. But beyond that, it's so easy that a caveman could do it.</p><p>And who knows. Maybe you'll mess around with ChromeOS Flex and decide that you prefer it over Windows. And maybe when it comes time to actually replace your computer, you'll first take a look at a Chromebook as opposed to anything else. After all, there are some great Chromebook models out there, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on">Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14</a>.</p>]]>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Today is a sad day for millions around the world, as Microsoft has officially ended support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/news/live/windows-10-end-of-life-latest-update-options">Windows 10</a>. Released in 2015, this operating system introduced a dramatic shift away from the "Metro" interface of Windows 8 and 8.1. It's also been regularly maintained despite Windows 11's introduction in 2011, with millions of users still relying on it for their daily computing needs.</p><p>So, with Microsoft ending the chapter on Windows 10, what does that actually mean? For starters, it's not like your laptop or computer will just stop working altogether. Those with compatible computers will likely eventually upgrade to Windows 11, but what if your computer doesn't meet the requirements? Well, you're in luck, as you can install ChromeOS Flex and not worry about buying something brand new when your current laptop works fine.</p><h2 id="what-is-chromeos-flex-2">What is ChromeOS Flex</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="rHKWqM4dXR3ZAb5VjozRci" name="install-chromeos-flex-screen" alt="Install or try out ChromeOS Flex during the initial setup process" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rHKWqM4dXR3ZAb5VjozRci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chrome-os-flex">ChromeOS Flex</a> has been around for quite some time, as it was originally known as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-try-chromeos-virtual-machine-you-buy-chromebook">CloudReady</a> and was developed by Neverware. It allowed you to install and use a modified version of ChromeOS on a virtual machine, adding a layer of versatility to your computing arsenal. Back in 2020, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-just-bought-neverware-makers-free-cloudready-upgrade">Google acquired Neverware</a>, before eventually re-releasing and rebranding CloudReady as ChromeOS Flex.</p><p>In doing so, Google also announced that it was making it possible to install ChromeOS Flex on select laptops and computers as a way to replace whatever current operating system you were running. This list has continued to expand over the years, as there are now thousands of laptops and computers that are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=16143057431931141904-NA">Certified to work</a> with the platform. Plus, Google regularly updates the list of compatible models, so you can easily figure out whether ChromeOS Flex will work on your computer.</p><p>To put it more simply, ChromeOS Flex is just a modified version of ChromeOS tweaked to work on laptops and computers that aren't <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks </a>or Chromeboxes. This means Windows or Mac computers are eligible, transforming them into a new machine with a new operating system.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-chromeos-flex-2">What are the benefits of ChromeOS Flex?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1098px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="KoPLJmWvNNX3n2CDBNDfJJ" name="chromeos-virus-protection-graphic" alt="Virus and Malware graphic for ChromeOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KoPLJmWvNNX3n2CDBNDfJJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1098" height="618" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most obvious benefit of ChromeOS Flex for those dealing with the end of Windows 10 is that it gives your computer a new lease on life. See, while you'll still be able to use Windows 10 on your computer, technically, until the end of time, there are a couple of problems that could arise. Arguably, the most important thing is that you'll no longer receive regular security updates, which could leave your computer open to malware and viruses due to vulnerabilities in the software.</p><p>Although you could rely on third-party apps to help keep your Windows 10 machine as virus-free as possible, there's another issue that lies ahead. There's a pretty good chance that whatever app or service you decide to use will eventually drop support for Windows 10 machines, putting you right back at square one.</p><div><blockquote><p>You don't have to worry about viruses on ChromeOS Flex. </p></blockquote></div><p>By installing ChromeOS Flex, there's a good chance you'll be able to extend the life of your machine for at least a few more years. In some instances, the Windows 10 laptop you're currently using could have its lifespan extended by another six or seven years with ChromeOS Flex. Not to mention that it's <em>almost</em> impossible to get a virus on ChromeOS or ChromeOS Flex, with the only real threat coming in the form of installing rogue or nefarious Chrome extensions.</p><h2 id="replace-windows-10-with-chromeos-flex-2">Replace Windows 10 with ChromeOS Flex</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5013px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bq3EQxMrgCdfurPuTri3LB" name="android-tablet-ui-on-surface-pro-11" alt="Android tablet UI on Microsoft Surface Pro 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bq3EQxMrgCdfurPuTri3LB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5013" height="2820" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the best things about ChromeOS Flex is that it's extremely simple to install.

Whatever the case may be, this reminds us of the whole USB-C push for phones.</p><p>Every phone features a USB-C, and users can effectively just ask their buddy for their charger if they're low. You're not exactly fretting the fact that they've got a Samsung charger, but you've got a Motorola. This Buds 2 Pro/2a case swap is giving similar vibes. The publication theorizes that Google couldâif they'd likeâmove into this worldview with their earbuds, but who knows.</p><p>The Pixel Buds Pro 2 just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-update-rolls-out-head-gestures-adaptive-audio-android">received a huge update</a> toward the end of September that brought Head Gestures and Adaptive Audio to all users. For the gestures, after installing the patch, Buds Pro 2 users can now nod their heads to answer calls and texts, while shaking their heads will decline those options. The Adaptive Audio update was also joined by Loud Noise Protection.</p><p>The former will automatically alter your sound's volume to filter out unwanted background noises. The latter helps to protect your hearing from sudden loud bursts of sound.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FBjhQRide_8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><ul><li><strong>Earbuds deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/headphone-and-speaker-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/electronics/shop-headphones-by-type/3944_133251_1095191_1230614?sort=best_match&cat_id=3944_133251_1095191_1230614_1230476&stores=3081&ps=40"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=earbuds&crid=2RWE1G9N1EIF&sprefix=earbuds%2Caps%2C161&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/audio/all-audio/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/earbuds"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

Who gets to see it? What are companies doing with them?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Any insight?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks.</strong></em></p><p>Whoa. This is an awesome question that should concern all of us. Thanks so much for sending it in and sharing it with us.</p><p>It's also hard to answer in many ways, confusing is plenty of others, and a little disturbing when talking about some companies. Let's dig into it.</p><p>First things first: a computer, but not necessarily a person, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-how-enable-sensitive-content-warnings">looks over every single image you upload anywhere</a>. It's for a good reason, because there are photographs that shouldn't have ever been taken and aren't "normal" for anyone to save. Pictures that exploit children are a great example, as are certain types of photos saved or shared with the wrong intentions. Nobody should have a problem wiping all that mess off the face of the planet.</p><p>Sometimes â and <em>I stress sometimes </em>â a person will need to check a photo that was flagged as not permitted. I happen to know someone who does this for a living, and she tells me it's extremely disturbing seeing what some people are trying to save. It sounds like this is, unfortunately, a necessary evil.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XvzChEfU2W2oZfxt7JdZCG" name="Instagram-logo-wide.jpg" alt="Instagram logo on a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvzChEfU2W2oZfxt7JdZCG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some companies do more, of course. Meta is a prime example. In July 2025, it was discovered that the company had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242789/meta-training-ai-models-facebook-instagram-photo-post-data" target="_blank">trained its AI on every photo uploaded to Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram since 2007</a>. The company states it no longer trains current AI models this way, but never outright says that it stopped analyzing photos.</p><p>It's important that this is <strong>only for uploaded photos</strong>. Meta also has an opt-in service that randomly grabs photos from your on-device library and uploads them to be analyzed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="XeWENyMzgGmkw6az5JBUc5" name="New-twitter-logo.jpg" alt="X logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XeWENyMzgGmkw6az5JBUc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other companies make sure to explain that they do not do anything similar. Google Photos, for example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/15344015?visit_id=638682604172372293-2305795082&p=photos-gemini-privacy&rd=1" target="_blank">states it doesn't train any AI using your photos,</a> and they would be used for such only if shared with other third parties at your request.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's not so cut-and-dried in most cases. Tech companies have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/read-the-fine-print">privacy policies</a> that they mostly follow, but these are often written in language that's hard to understand, are so long that nobody would need them, and are subject to changes at any time, even after you've agreed to the terms.</p><p>It's almost impossible to tell what happens to pictures you share, let alone the ones you save in the cloud and don't intend to share in most cases.</p><h2 id="assume-the-worst-2">Assume the worst</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jYwbQzWRXHzs44yo4aBUNk" name="Reddit-homepage-1.jpg" alt="Reddit homepage on a laptop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jYwbQzWRXHzs44yo4aBUNk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What most of us need to do is assume that everything we have ever posted online, publicly or privately, isn't ours alone. With the dawn of AI-everywhere, there is a good chance that every word you type and every image you upload is being used to make it all work.</p><p>It's easy to assume that X, for example, is using your posts to train AI, because they are closely tied to an AI company. But most AI companies also buy data. That message you posted in the lobby of some silly phone game you downloaded is probably saved and offered as part of an AI-training package for sale to the highest bidder.</p><p>This isn't a big deal to a lot of people, but for others, it is. Only you can decide if Google or OpenAI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/reddits-sale-user-data-ai-training-draws-ftc-investigation/#:~:text=Reddit%20has%20been%20licensing%20data,has%20a%20stake%20in%20Reddit." target="_blank">using all of your Reddit posts</a> matters to you (they do). It's also not going to change any time soon in many places: remember, data privacy laws apply, so if you live in the EU, for example, there are different rules for your data than there are in the U.S.</p><p>Assume everything you do online is out there for the rest of us to see if you want to be proactive. You can't scrub it away, no matter how hard you try, so be thoughtful before you share anything. No matter how much we may not like it, it will be OK.</p>]]>

Additionally, even with a smaller battery, the S25 Edge offers all-day battery life and 25W charging, which takes around 80 minutes to fully replenish the battery.</p><p>All in all, this is a really good pick at this price, and it's tough to say how long this discount will last.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,219.99" data-dimension48="$1,219.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVMVZSY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="6qR9jhpW8ExE78Mxtp6TGf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-official-render-titanium-jetblack" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6qR9jhpW8ExE78Mxtp6TGf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge (512GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVMVZSY" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,219.99" data-dimension48="$1,219.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,219.99</del> <strong>$729.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge is currently just $730 at Amazon, representing a massive 40% discount that brings the phone down to the cheapest price point it's ever seen. The S25 Edge is an impressively thin phone, and while it lacks a bit on cameras and charging speeds, it's a solid phone that's especially competitive at this low sticker price.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVMVZSY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,219.99" data-dimension48="$1,219.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>âRecommended if: </strong>you like having a super-thin phone that still feels like a durable build; you have other Samsung Galaxy devices and you want optimal compatibility between them; you value having smooth, powerful performance on your phones but you don't want to pay a premium price tag.</p><p><strong>âSkip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a phone with industry-leading cameras and you'd rather consider upgrading to one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones </a>available; you prefer a phone with super-fast charging capabilities; you don't really care about having a phone with a thin design.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is a solid phone that typically retails at over $1,200. This particular deal is for the 512GB storage version of the phone, and it's available in Titanium Jet Black, Titanium Silver, and Titanium Icy Blue.</p><p>The powerful performance on the S25 Edge is backed by the capable Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy CPU, as well as 12GB of RAM that supports high levels of performance-intensive multitasking.</p><p>It's worth noting that the Edge doesn't include a telephoto lens, and the rest of its cameras feel a touch less sharp than the rest of the S25 lineup. But if that isn't a dealbreaker for you, this is a really good price and might be worth your consideration.</p>]]>

It's 120Hz capable and doesn't have huge bezels everyone seems to hate, but it's an LCD. Blacks aren't as black, and viewing angles matter.

You don't have to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi</a> (maybe you want to try it, though), but you need to be in a place where Fi sells phones to get this one. That's a bummer because Google still hasn't figured out how to sell everything everywhere.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>So, should you buy one? No.</p><p><strong>You should think about buying </strong><em><strong>two</strong></em>.</p><p>Look, I'm a happy, well-adjusted cheapskate and hate spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on a phone. Normally, I would never say to buy a phone you don't need. But at $50, this turns into a device you can set up, stick in the drawer, and use as a backup when things go bad.</p><p>You expect some clamshell dumbphone burner on the shelf at Walmart to be in the $50 range. You do not expect a capable, full-featured 2025 Android phone at that price. It may not be the best phone available right now, but it is 100% the best value in phones available right now.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a3c68494-b783-4956-bc2e-c1106964449d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Moto G 2025: $170" data-dimension48="Moto G 2025: $170" href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/moto-g-2025?srsltid=AfmBOord72tlWzTlSuCXZD7Lq_2xVcLEu7U4XVMBdfojkh99PI2ONzXd&pli=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="me2qPx2NzQbBwusYJWb4gK" name="moto g 5g 2025 square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/me2qPx2NzQbBwusYJWb4gK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Moto G 2025: </strong><a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/moto-g-2025?srsltid=AfmBOord72tlWzTlSuCXZD7Lq_2xVcLEu7U4XVMBdfojkh99PI2ONzXd&pli=1" target="_blank" data-dimension112="a3c68494-b783-4956-bc2e-c1106964449d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Moto G 2025: $170" data-dimension48="Moto G 2025: $170" data-dimension25=""><del>$170</del><strong> $50 at Google Fi</strong></a></p><p>Motorola's budget phone comes in at the perfect price.

Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV" name="lloyd-should-you-buy_720" caption="" alt="Lloyd going shopping!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">So many tech products!

We're here to help you do just that!</p></div></div><p>Often, it's good to take a step back and see what you're going to get inside that pretty package. Was it worth what you paid for it? Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p>Should you buy a brand-new 2025 Moto G for $50? Because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/moto-g-2025?srsltid=AfmBOord72tlWzTlSuCXZD7Lq_2xVcLEu7U4XVMBdfojkh99PI2ONzXd&pli=1" target="_blank">Google wants to sell you one</a>.</p><p>In 2025, fifty dollars doesn't buy much. Inflation has gone crazy in the past 12 months; everything is going up except the paycheck, and money still doesn't grow on trees. There's a good chance you'll spend more than $50 at the gas pump nowadays.</p><p>But you can get a phone, a brand-spanking new one, for $50 from Google Fi. They're selling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">2025 Moto G</a> unlocked for $49.99 plus those pesky taxes and such.

It's not a tiny phone or one of those thin phones that somehow became cool again, but it's not some gargantuan beast like the Galaxy S Ultra either. Regardless, it has a 5,000 mAh battery inside that <strong>will</strong> last you all day. This time, you can believe them when they say all-day battery life.</p><p><strong>It has 5G</strong>. It's unlocked and will work almost anywhere on earth. Does it have support for every radio band? Nope.

It's a 720 x 1604 pixel, 20:9 ratio display that checks in at a respectable 262 ppi (pixels-per-inch) density, so things don't look like fuzzy garbage.</p><p><strong>It has an SD card slot</strong>.

However, artificial intelligence features seem like the one area where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> objectively take the crown. Google is firing on all cylinders in AI development, and the switch from Google Assistant to Gemini resulted in generally positive feedback.</p><p>Apple Intelligence, meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pokes-fun-at-apples-iphone-17-ai-capabilities">has hit snags and roadblocks at every turn</a>. Core features advertised years ago still haven't arrived, and the ChatGPT integration aims to bail out Apple for stalling AI progress. So, is this as clear-cut as it may seem? Here's how Apple Intelligence on iPhone compares to using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> on Android.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gemini-vs-siri-does-ios-or-android-have-the-best-assistant"><span>Gemini vs. Siri: Does iOS or Android have the best assistant?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kwUHPFz8WXsE5EnhhQz4j8" name="Apple-Intelligence-vs-Gemini" alt="The Apple Intelligence & Siri menu beside a Pixel running Gemini." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwUHPFz8WXsE5EnhhQz4j8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Siri, the digital assistant on iPhone, is intertwined with Apple Intelligence features. It's worth noting that the revamped version of Siri teased at a prior Apple Worldwide Developers Conference hasn't actually shipped yet. By comparison, Google is in the process of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">replacing Google Assistant with Gemini</a> as Android's digital assistant of the future.</p><p>Siri and Gemini both have two different modes of interaction: voice and text. iPhone users can call up Siri with a long press of the side button, a double-tap of the gesture bar, or the wake word "Hey Siri." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Android users can access Gemini</a> with a long press of the side button or the wake word "Hey Google." As Gemini is a full-fledged chatbot, it has better access to the web and is powered by large language models for context and AI processing.</p><p>That enables unique features for Gemini that Siri can't match. While both digital assistants support text commands, only Gemini can accept file uploads for additional context. Gemini is also better at responding to basic questions in natural language, whereas Siri will frequently direct users to a search engine if it can't come up with a response.</p><p>Keep in mind that users of Siri and Gemini have reported unreliability in some use cases, like while managing device settings or controlling smart home systems. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-is-dialing-back-more-assistant-features-on-android-and-nest-devices">Gemini lacks a few core Google Assistant features</a> that were either deprecated or have not yet been added to the AI digital assistant.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gemini-live-vs-visual-intelligence-which-multimodal-ai-is-best"><span>Gemini Live vs. Visual Intelligence: Which multimodal AI is best?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DBpTh8fifHXNyQzbx6AePW" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-5" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DBpTh8fifHXNyQzbx6AePW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android users gain access to a popular multimodal AI interface called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live</a>, which is available on most Android phones across brands and generations.

This multimodal solution allows you to share what's on your screen or in your surroundings and ask questions about it. As the "live" branding suggests, this all happens in real time, with only brief delays to account for cloud processing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vpw87wtM83SgZTReTiwuG8" name="Visual-Intelligence-2" alt="Visual Intelligence in iOS 26 on an iPhone Air." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vpw87wtM83SgZTReTiwuG8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Visual Intelligence might look similar, but it's much different. The feature functions more akin to uploading a photo to Gemini for context than using Gemini Live. With Visual Intelligence, you can snap a photo and converse with ChatGPT about it over text. Or, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">search Google for the photo using Lens</a>. Either way, Visual Intelligence doesn't support the "live" component and is limited compared to Gemini Live.</p><p>Gemini Live is the more helpful and versatile option here â I've used it for everything from tending to plants to designing apartments. The good news for iPhone users is that Gemini Live <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/hey-siri-wheres-apple-intelligence-gemini-is-now-the-top-free-app-on-ios">can also be enjoyed on iOS via the Gemini app</a>.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-magic-eraser-vs-clean-up-who-has-better-image-editing"><span>Magic Eraser vs. Clean Up: Who has better image editing?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="voRDNE9qQds8gvhTYmT6gM" name="apple-clean-up-iphone-16-pro-max-magic-eraser-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Google Magic Eraser on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Apple Clean Up on iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/voRDNE9qQds8gvhTYmT6gM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple and Google each offer their own generative editing features that leverage AI, known as Clean Up and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>. Samsung has its own, too, but we'll compare Clean Up to Magic Eraser since the latter is available on all Android phones. Google has been doing object removal and generative fill for longer than Apple, so it's better, right?</p><p>That actually might not be the case. In our latest test, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/revisiting-apple-clean-up-vs-google-magic-eraser">comparing outputs between Clean Up and Magic Eraser</a> led to mixed results. Clean Up successfully removed certain objects, like a dog's leash, in a way that looked natural and impressive. In another instance, Clean Up and Magic Eraser removed people from a photo that passed the eye test at a distance â but lacked quality up close. And in some cases, Clean Up would fail to correctly remove objects it removed just a few minutes before.</p><p>In other words, Clean Up and Magic Eraser are both less-than-stellar ways to remove unwanted people or objects from photos on an iPhone or Android device. They work in some situations and underwhelm in others. Neither is replacing Photoshop anytime soon, and thus, this battle between generative AI editors ends in a draw.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3tn6pkJubocvn8g4G4umMM" name="pixel-studio-pixel-9-pro-xl-2.jpg" alt="Pixel Studio app on Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tn6pkJubocvn8g4G4umMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond generative removal and fill, both Android and iPhone have AI image generation support. On the Android side, it'll depend on your phone manufacturer.

For example, Google Pixel phones have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a>, while Samsung Galaxy phones have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a>. iPhone users get Image Playground, but all of these image generation clients are effectively the same.</p><p>They all leverage text-to-image AI models to generate photos, some of which are better than others. Generally, the model's safeguards will affect their handiness. Image Playground has strict guardrails preventing it from creating lifelike images, whereas Pixel Studio can now generate images of people.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-vs-iphone-security-and-privacy"><span>Android vs. iPhone: Security and privacy</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4KJrf2twULD4748vqe4wCJ" name="Galaxy-S25-On-Device-AI" alt="The 'process data only on device' page in Samsung settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KJrf2twULD4748vqe4wCJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Security and privacy are the one area where iPhones have the edge. Most Gemini features require cloud processing and include extensive data sharing policies. By default, your data stored by Google is retained for 18 months before being deleted. Anything that human reviewers looked at is kept for up to three years, even if you manually delete your data.</p><p>As such, you need to keep privacy at the forefront when using Gemini on Android. You wouldn't want to share anything you wouldn't be fine handing over to Google or its employees.</p><p>Apple treats Apple Intelligence differently â it processes AI tasks on-device or using its Private Cloud Compute servers. They're run using a custom operating system that is made public so independent security researchers can verify there are zero vulnerabilities. With Private Cloud Compute, not even Apple has access to your data.</p><p>The notable exception is that using ChatGPT integration will share queries with OpenAI, but you'll need to give permission every time you choose to tap into those resources.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-vs-iphone-verdict"><span>Android vs. iPhone: Verdict</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the moment, Android has the clear edge when it comes to mobile AI. Gemini is a better digital assistant than Siri, and Gemini Live blows Visual Intelligence out of the water. Image generation is a toss-up, and better security and privacy policies aren't enough to pull Apple Intelligence ahead. Apple's weak foundation models mean users will need to use external sources like ChatGPT more often, negating privacy benefits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Beware, nothing is official yet, so we don't know exactly how the Galaxy S26 Edge will look. Leaks and rumors give us a solid idea, though, so let's dive in!</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Pricing and availability </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1416px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.20%;"><img id="v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-2" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1416" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> came about five months after the main trio of Galaxy S25 models, including the base, Plus, and Ultra versions. Samsung is said to be switching things up this year, though it's unclear exactly how. Multiple rumors claim the South Korean tech giant is axing the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus and releasing the Galaxy S26 Edge in its place. However, one recent prediction states that both the Edge and Plus models will be released in January 2026.</p><p>Either way, we expect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Edge</a> to be priced the same as its predecessor at $1,099. This will either net you 256GB or 512GB of base storage, but the former is a safe bet. There will certainly be a few color options, although we don't know what they'll be just yet.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge officially launched on May 30, 2025, priced at $1,099 for the 256GB model. It's available in Silver, Jet Black, and Icy Blue colorways. The phone has received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-the-galaxy-s25-edge-at-usd400-off-its-normal-price">major post-launch discounts</a> and isn't hard to find well under the $1,000 mark at the time of publishing.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-4" alt="The front of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge feels like an <em>honest</em> thin phone. It has a sleek design and is 5.8mm nearly all the way around, except for the smallest of rear camera bumps. Meanwhile, it's easy to see competitors like the iPhone Air as <em>cheating</em> their thinness a bit.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> in particular employs a large camera plateau to slim the body down to 5.6mm. According to the latest leaks and rumors, Samsung will take this strategy and run with it on the Galaxy S26 Edge. Current design renders show a gigantic camera island on the back that spans the upper-third section of the phone. Presumably, this will not only hold the Galaxy S26 Edge's two rear cameras but also some internal components.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Galaxy S25 Edge has a cleaner back than the iPhone Air, that'll flip with the Galaxy S26 Edge, which will likely have a camera island that's more than double the size of the iPhone's camera plateau. However, Samsung is rumored to ship the Galaxy S26 Edge with a 5.5mm thickness, partially beating the iPhone Air at its own game.</p><p>Otherwise, the Galaxy S26 Edge may look and feel much like the Galaxy S25 Edge. You can expect to see a matte titanium frame and a frosted glass back, and a few basic colorways. As for which one will look better, that'll depend on your taste. I prefer the minimalist look of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge based on early renders, but these aren't final.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1434px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.04%;"><img id="uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-1" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1434" height="818" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Moving to the display, the Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to have a similar, if not identical, screen. It'll measure around 6.7 inches, use AMOLED tech, and support 120Hz refresh rates. The current Galaxy S25 Edge offers a peak brightness rating of 2,600 nits, but this could be improved on the new model.</p><p>Keep in mind that although Samsung is using the "Edge" branding, both models will have a flat glass display.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.22%;"><img id="NEUQQEbKbj4ayGpmX98QRZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-3" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NEUQQEbKbj4ayGpmX98QRZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1426" height="816" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is already a top performer, delivering a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> chipset paired with 12GB of RAM. Still, the Galaxy S26 Edge is said to switch things up. Samsung might be moving to a dual-chip strategy with the Galaxy S26 Edge, offering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> in some regions and the Exynos 2600 in others.</p><p>Rumors also suggest that Samsung might bump the internal memory from 12GB to 16GB on the Galaxy S26 Edge. This, paired with a chip upgrade, might help the Galaxy S26 Edge perform better for gaming and on-device AI processing.</p><p>Otherwise, the key upgrades are in battery life and charging. Samsung is thought to be bumping the Galaxy S26 Edge's battery capacity to 4,200mAh, up from 3,900mAh on the Galaxy S25 Edge. This would address a crucial pain point of the Galaxy S25 Edge, which drains power quickly. While wired charging is expected to stay the same at 25W, Samsung might add <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 magnetic support</a> on the new model.</p><div ><table><caption>Rumored specs breakdown</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Category</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge (rumored/expected)</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8.5 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+</p><p>Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO</p><p>2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+</p><p>Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO</p><p>2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide, f/1.7, 24mm, OIS, PDAF, 0.6Âµm</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide, f/1.7, 24mm, OIS, PDAF, 0.6Âµm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 13mm, PDAF, 1.4Âµm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP, f/2.2, 26mm, PDAF</p></td><td  ><p>12MP, f/2.2, 26mm, PDAF</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>3,900mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W</p></td><td  ><p>25W</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 75.7 x 5.5mm</p></td><td  ><p>158.2 x 75.6 x 5.8mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>~163g</p></td><td  ><p>163g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Icyblue, Titanium Silver, Titanium Jetblack</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>We're also looking forward to an exciting camera upgrade. The main camera isn't rumored to get a boost this year, but that likely won't be a problem. The current Galaxy S25 Edge already has a 200MP main sensor that performs fantastically in most situations. However, the secondary 12MP ultrawide could use improvement. With the Galaxy S26 Edge, Samsung is expected to retain the 200MP primary lens, but add a 50MP ultrawide shooter.</p><p>The upgrade to the ultrawide lens will add detail to your photos while maintaining a similar expanded field-of-view. On the front, there will likely be the same 12MP, f/2.2 selfie camera with auto focus.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-should-you-wait-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Should you wait?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZZ7ebw29CUwDkre7qif2qY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-3" alt="An angled view of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZ7ebw29CUwDkre7qif2qY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a current Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge owner and user, I'd strongly recommend waiting for the Galaxy S26 Edge, with one major exception. If you need a thin phone <em>today</em> and have a tighter budget, buying a Galaxy S25 Edge now at a sweet discount â or waiting for Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales â seems to be your best option. Otherwise, hold off.</p><p>You see, the Galaxy S25 Edge has notable drawbacks. It doesn't have great battery life, the cameras could be better, and it lacks magnets. It's not even quite as thin as the iPhone Air. The great news is that Samsung plans to address all these points in the Galaxy S26 Edge, if rumors are any indication.</p><p>For me, the biggest potential Galaxy S26 Edge upgrade is the inclusion of Qi2 magnets. With thin phones, you know you're going to need a midday charge at some point. It might not be an everyday occurrence, but it will be necessary on long travel days and the like. These midday charges are painful without Qi2/MagSafe support, but with it, they're as easy as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">snapping on a power bank</a>.</p><p>That perk alone, plus all the other rumored upgrades, is reason enough to hold out for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ecc7c7ca-0859-47fd-ad69-7cd69d32a288">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UuNfEhb6YPDD2Hq8LNhJX.jpg' alt="A sample Galaxy S26 Edge render from OnLeaks and Android Headlines."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Worth waiting for</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is only a few months old, and the Galaxy S26 Edge is only a few months away.

While the original Galaxy S25 Edge launched over the summer, the upcoming Galaxy S26 Edge might debut alongside the rest of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series in January 2026.</p><p>If you're in the market for a thin phone, you have quite a few options: buying the Galaxy S25 Edge now, waiting for the Galaxy S26 Edge, or throwing a curveball and choosing the iPhone Air instead.</p><p>To help you make that decision, let's compare the current Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge specs with the Galaxy S26 Edge's rumored improvements. Beware, nothing is official yet, so we don't know exactly how the Galaxy S26 Edge will look. Leaks and rumors give us a solid idea, though, so let's dive in!</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Pricing and availability </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1416px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.20%;"><img id="v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-2" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1416" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> came about five months after the main trio of Galaxy S25 models, including the base, Plus, and Ultra versions. Samsung is said to be switching things up this year, though it's unclear exactly how. Multiple rumors claim the South Korean tech giant is axing the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus and releasing the Galaxy S26 Edge in its place. However, one recent prediction states that both the Edge and Plus models will be released in January 2026.</p><p>Either way, we expect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Edge</a> to be priced the same as its predecessor at $1,099. This will either net you 256GB or 512GB of base storage, but the former is a safe bet. There will certainly be a few color options, although we don't know what they'll be just yet.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge officially launched on May 30, 2025, priced at $1,099 for the 256GB model. It's available in Silver, Jet Black, and Icy Blue colorways. The phone has received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-the-galaxy-s25-edge-at-usd400-off-its-normal-price">major post-launch discounts</a> and isn't hard to find well under the $1,000 mark at the time of publishing.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-4" alt="The front of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge feels like an <em>honest</em> thin phone. It has a sleek design and is 5.8mm nearly all the way around, except for the smallest of rear camera bumps. Meanwhile, it's easy to see competitors like the iPhone Air as <em>cheating</em> their thinness a bit.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> in particular employs a large camera plateau to slim the body down to 5.6mm. According to the latest leaks and rumors, Samsung will take this strategy and run with it on the Galaxy S26 Edge. Current design renders show a gigantic camera island on the back that spans the upper-third section of the phone. Presumably, this will not only hold the Galaxy S26 Edge's two rear cameras but also some internal components.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Galaxy S25 Edge has a cleaner back than the iPhone Air, that'll flip with the Galaxy S26 Edge, which will likely have a camera island that's more than double the size of the iPhone's camera plateau. However, Samsung is rumored to ship the Galaxy S26 Edge with a 5.5mm thickness, partially beating the iPhone Air at its own game.</p><p>Otherwise, the Galaxy S26 Edge may look and feel much like the Galaxy S25 Edge. You can expect to see a matte titanium frame and a frosted glass back, and a few basic colorways. As for which one will look better, that'll depend on your taste. I prefer the minimalist look of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge based on early renders, but these aren't final.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1434px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.04%;"><img id="uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-1" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1434" height="818" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Moving to the display, the Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to have a similar, if not identical, screen. It'll measure around 6.7 inches, use AMOLED tech, and support 120Hz refresh rates. The current Galaxy S25 Edge offers a peak brightness rating of 2,600 nits, but this could be improved on the new model.</p><p>Keep in mind that although Samsung is using the "Edge" branding, both models will have a flat glass display.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.22%;"><img id="NEUQQEbKbj4ayGpmX98QRZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-3" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NEUQQEbKbj4ayGpmX98QRZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1426" height="816" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is already a top performer, delivering a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> chipset paired with 12GB of RAM. Still, the Galaxy S26 Edge is said to switch things up. Samsung might be moving to a dual-chip strategy with the Galaxy S26 Edge, offering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> in some regions and the Exynos 2600 in others.</p><p>Rumors also suggest that Samsung might bump the internal memory from 12GB to 16GB on the Galaxy S26 Edge. This, paired with a chip upgrade, might help the Galaxy S26 Edge perform better for gaming and on-device AI processing.</p><p>Otherwise, the key upgrades are in battery life and charging. Samsung is thought to be bumping the Galaxy S26 Edge's battery capacity to 4,200mAh, up from 3,900mAh on the Galaxy S25 Edge. This would address a crucial pain point of the Galaxy S25 Edge, which drains power quickly. While wired charging is expected to stay the same at 25W, Samsung might add <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 magnetic support</a> on the new model.</p><div ><table><caption>Rumored specs breakdown</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Category</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge (rumored/expected)</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8.5 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+</p><p>Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO</p><p>2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+</p><p>Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO</p><p>2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide, f/1.7, 24mm, OIS, PDAF, 0.6Âµm</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide, f/1.7, 24mm, OIS, PDAF, 0.6Âµm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 13mm, PDAF, 1.4Âµm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP, f/2.2, 26mm, PDAF</p></td><td  ><p>12MP, f/2.2, 26mm, PDAF</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>3,900mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W</p></td><td  ><p>25W</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 75.7 x 5.5mm</p></td><td  ><p>158.2 x 75.6 x 5.8mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>~163g</p></td><td  ><p>163g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Icyblue, Titanium Silver, Titanium Jetblack</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>We're also looking forward to an exciting camera upgrade. The main camera isn't rumored to get a boost this year, but that likely won't be a problem. The current Galaxy S25 Edge already has a 200MP main sensor that performs fantastically in most situations. However, the secondary 12MP ultrawide could use improvement. With the Galaxy S26 Edge, Samsung is expected to retain the 200MP primary lens, but add a 50MP ultrawide shooter.</p><p>The upgrade to the ultrawide lens will add detail to your photos while maintaining a similar expanded field-of-view. On the front, there will likely be the same 12MP, f/2.2 selfie camera with auto focus.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-should-you-wait-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Should you wait?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZZ7ebw29CUwDkre7qif2qY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-3" alt="An angled view of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZ7ebw29CUwDkre7qif2qY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a current Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge owner and user, I'd strongly recommend waiting for the Galaxy S26 Edge, with one major exception. If you need a thin phone <em>today</em> and have a tighter budget, buying a Galaxy S25 Edge now at a sweet discount â or waiting for Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales â seems to be your best option. Otherwise, hold off.</p><p>You see, the Galaxy S25 Edge has notable drawbacks. It doesn't have great battery life, the cameras could be better, and it lacks magnets. It's not even quite as thin as the iPhone Air. The great news is that Samsung plans to address all these points in the Galaxy S26 Edge, if rumors are any indication.</p><p>For me, the biggest potential Galaxy S26 Edge upgrade is the inclusion of Qi2 magnets. With thin phones, you know you're going to need a midday charge at some point. It might not be an everyday occurrence, but it will be necessary on long travel days and the like. These midday charges are painful without Qi2/MagSafe support, but with it, they're as easy as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">snapping on a power bank</a>.</p><p>That perk alone, plus all the other rumored upgrades, is reason enough to hold out for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ecc7c7ca-0859-47fd-ad69-7cd69d32a288">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UuNfEhb6YPDD2Hq8LNhJX.jpg' alt="A sample Galaxy S26 Edge render from OnLeaks and Android Headlines."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Worth waiting for</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is only a few months old, and the Galaxy S26 Edge is only a few months away.

While the original Galaxy S25 Edge launched over the summer, the upcoming Galaxy S26 Edge might debut alongside the rest of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series in January 2026.</p><p>If you're in the market for a thin phone, you have quite a few options: buying the Galaxy S25 Edge now, waiting for the Galaxy S26 Edge, or throwing a curveball and choosing the iPhone Air instead.</p><p>To help you make that decision, let's compare the current Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge specs with the Galaxy S26 Edge's rumored improvements. Beware, nothing is official yet, so we don't know exactly how the Galaxy S26 Edge will look. Leaks and rumors give us a solid idea, though, so let's dive in!</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Pricing and availability </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1416px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.20%;"><img id="v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-2" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1416" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> came about five months after the main trio of Galaxy S25 models, including the base, Plus, and Ultra versions. Samsung is said to be switching things up this year, though it's unclear exactly how. Multiple rumors claim the South Korean tech giant is axing the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus and releasing the Galaxy S26 Edge in its place. However, one recent prediction states that both the Edge and Plus models will be released in January 2026.</p><p>Either way, we expect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Edge</a> to be priced the same as its predecessor at $1,099. This will either net you 256GB or 512GB of base storage, but the former is a safe bet. There will certainly be a few color options, although we don't know what they'll be just yet.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge officially launched on May 30, 2025, priced at $1,099 for the 256GB model. It's available in Silver, Jet Black, and Icy Blue colorways. The phone has received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-the-galaxy-s25-edge-at-usd400-off-its-normal-price">major post-launch discounts</a> and isn't hard to find well under the $1,000 mark at the time of publishing.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-4" alt="The front of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge feels like an <em>honest</em> thin phone. It has a sleek design and is 5.8mm nearly all the way around, except for the smallest of rear camera bumps. Meanwhile, it's easy to see competitors like the iPhone Air as <em>cheating</em> their thinness a bit.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> in particular employs a large camera plateau to slim the body down to 5.6mm. According to the latest leaks and rumors, Samsung will take this strategy and run with it on the Galaxy S26 Edge. Current design renders show a gigantic camera island on the back that spans the upper-third section of the phone. Presumably, this will not only hold the Galaxy S26 Edge's two rear cameras but also some internal components.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Galaxy S25 Edge has a cleaner back than the iPhone Air, that'll flip with the Galaxy S26 Edge, which will likely have a camera island that's more than double the size of the iPhone's camera plateau. However, Samsung is rumored to ship the Galaxy S26 Edge with a 5.5mm thickness, partially beating the iPhone Air at its own game.</p><p>Otherwise, the Galaxy S26 Edge may look and feel much like the Galaxy S25 Edge. You can expect to see a matte titanium frame and a frosted glass back, and a few basic colorways. As for which one will look better, that'll depend on your taste. I prefer the minimalist look of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge based on early renders, but these aren't final.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1434px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.04%;"><img id="uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-1" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1434" height="818" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Moving to the display, the Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to have a similar, if not identical, screen. It'll measure around 6.7 inches, use AMOLED tech, and support 120Hz refresh rates. The current Galaxy S25 Edge offers a peak brightness rating of 2,600 nits, but this could be improved on the new model.</p><p>Keep in mind that although Samsung is using the "Edge" branding, both models will have a flat glass display.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.22%;"><img id="NEUQQEbKbj4ayGpmX98QRZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-3" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NEUQQEbKbj4ayGpmX98QRZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1426" height="816" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is already a top performer, delivering a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> chipset paired with 12GB of RAM. Still, the Galaxy S26 Edge is said to switch things up. Samsung might be moving to a dual-chip strategy with the Galaxy S26 Edge, offering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> in some regions and the Exynos 2600 in others.</p><p>Rumors also suggest that Samsung might bump the internal memory from 12GB to 16GB on the Galaxy S26 Edge. This, paired with a chip upgrade, might help the Galaxy S26 Edge perform better for gaming and on-device AI processing.</p><p>Otherwise, the key upgrades are in battery life and charging. Samsung is thought to be bumping the Galaxy S26 Edge's battery capacity to 4,200mAh, up from 3,900mAh on the Galaxy S25 Edge. This would address a crucial pain point of the Galaxy S25 Edge, which drains power quickly. While wired charging is expected to stay the same at 25W, Samsung might add <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 magnetic support</a> on the new model.</p><div ><table><caption>Rumored specs breakdown</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Category</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge (rumored/expected)</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8.5 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+</p><p>Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO</p><p>2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+</p><p>Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO</p><p>2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide, f/1.7, 24mm, OIS, PDAF, 0.6Âµm</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide, f/1.7, 24mm, OIS, PDAF, 0.6Âµm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 13mm, PDAF, 1.4Âµm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP, f/2.2, 26mm, PDAF</p></td><td  ><p>12MP, f/2.2, 26mm, PDAF</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>3,900mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W</p></td><td  ><p>25W</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 75.7 x 5.5mm</p></td><td  ><p>158.2 x 75.6 x 5.8mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>~163g</p></td><td  ><p>163g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Icyblue, Titanium Silver, Titanium Jetblack</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>We're also looking forward to an exciting camera upgrade. The main camera isn't rumored to get a boost this year, but that likely won't be a problem. The current Galaxy S25 Edge already has a 200MP main sensor that performs fantastically in most situations. However, the secondary 12MP ultrawide could use improvement. With the Galaxy S26 Edge, Samsung is expected to retain the 200MP primary lens, but add a 50MP ultrawide shooter.</p><p>The upgrade to the ultrawide lens will add detail to your photos while maintaining a similar expanded field-of-view. On the front, there will likely be the same 12MP, f/2.2 selfie camera with auto focus.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-should-you-wait-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Should you wait?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZZ7ebw29CUwDkre7qif2qY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-3" alt="An angled view of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZ7ebw29CUwDkre7qif2qY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a current Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge owner and user, I'd strongly recommend waiting for the Galaxy S26 Edge, with one major exception. If you need a thin phone <em>today</em> and have a tighter budget, buying a Galaxy S25 Edge now at a sweet discount â or waiting for Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales â seems to be your best option. Otherwise, hold off.</p><p>You see, the Galaxy S25 Edge has notable drawbacks. It doesn't have great battery life, the cameras could be better, and it lacks magnets. It's not even quite as thin as the iPhone Air. The great news is that Samsung plans to address all these points in the Galaxy S26 Edge, if rumors are any indication.</p><p>For me, the biggest potential Galaxy S26 Edge upgrade is the inclusion of Qi2 magnets. With thin phones, you know you're going to need a midday charge at some point. It might not be an everyday occurrence, but it will be necessary on long travel days and the like. These midday charges are painful without Qi2/MagSafe support, but with it, they're as easy as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">snapping on a power bank</a>.</p><p>That perk alone, plus all the other rumored upgrades, is reason enough to hold out for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ecc7c7ca-0859-47fd-ad69-7cd69d32a288">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UuNfEhb6YPDD2Hq8LNhJX.jpg' alt="A sample Galaxy S26 Edge render from OnLeaks and Android Headlines."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Worth waiting for</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is only a few months old, and the Galaxy S26 Edge is only a few months away.

While Google hasnât made every component of Android 16 (notably QPR1) public, the LineageOS team didnât wait around and launched using whatâs already accessible.</p><p>Because Google delayed releasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> QPR1 source, LineageOS couldnât merge those updates. Thatâs why this release is labeled 23.0 instead of 23.1, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lineageos-23-release-3604073/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>'s Mishaal Rahman. The team opted not to sit idle, deciding that providing users with a baseline Android 16 build was better than holding everything until Google catches up.</p><p>As for features: everything from Android 16âs original stable release is included, such as predictive back navigation, enforced edge-to-edge display, better app adaptivity, and support for advanced protection devices.</p><p>On top of that, several built-in apps are revamped. The camera app Aperture now supports Ultra HDR, RAW capture, a redesigned notification island, and added indicators. The music app Twelve gets a shuffle mode, a more informative Now Playing screen, extended Jellyfin integration, and related improvements.</p><p>For TV setups, thereâs a new ad-free launcher called Catapult, designed to be clean and fast. Under the hood, thereâs groundwork for bigger things: QEMU-based virtualization, better support for devices running mainline Linux kernels, and more robust infrastructure to help future compatibility.</p><h2 id="some-gaps-remain-2">Some gaps remain</h2><p>That said, some features are held back or partially implemented: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a>, for example, and Desktop Mode have limited presence here because they rely on components from QPR1. Security updates pose another hurdle. Googleâs shift to risk-based security bulletins means only high-risk vulnerabilities are disclosed monthly; the rest get tucked into quarterly releases. Since many patches arenât publicly released right away, LineageOS is forced to wait and then integrate them later.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>, which once got âday-oneâ treatment, no longer enjoy privileged status.

Previously, each paid result had its own individual label. The best part is that Google is adding a "Hide sponsored results" button below the section, letting you collapse those results and remove them from view instantly.</p><h2 id="2"></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yGQtdjgzdB7Q6JyFBWwGwN" name="google-hide-sponsored-results" alt="Hiding sponsored results in Google Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGQtdjgzdB7Q6JyFBWwGwN.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a small but meaningful change for anyone who prefers a cleaner search experience focused only on organic results. The option doesn't persist across searches â meaning the sponsored block will reappear each time you search for something new â but it's still a step toward decluttering Google Search.</p><p>The company also notes that tapping the button will also allow users to conveniently jump back to the top of the page after hiding the section. Google says that the update is currently rolling out globally to desktop and mobile users.</p><p>Google, of course, isn't giving up on ads anytime soon since they remain a core part of its business model. But providing this option still makes Search feel cleaner and more user-friendly.</p><p>In a time when the Search experience has become increasingly cluttered, this feels like a move in the right direction, especially for those, like me, who prefer the classic, organic search view over the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-finds-new-shortcut-google-digs-deep-with-its-search-model">AI Mode</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overview-save-feature-expansion">AI Overviews</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It's unlikely Samsung will upgrade these to IP69, though.</p></article></section><p>For as long as I can remember, Samsung flagship phones have been water-resistant. The Galaxy S5 was the first Samsung phone with IP67 water and dust resistance, and the Galaxy S7 upgraded that to IP68 just two years later.</p><p>Since then, basically every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a> has featured either IP67 or IP68 water and dust resistance, even including Samsung's most affordable Galaxy A-series phones.</p><p>While companies like Honor and OnePlus have started upgrading their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">latest flagship phones</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a>, it's unlikely that Samsung will be making the move any time soon. To date, no rumors or leaks point to Samsung adding IP69 resistance to the Galaxy S26 family.</p><h2 id="waterproof-vs-water-resistant-2">Waterproof vs water-resistant</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zrK2oJANH5u3D24ZByoeP5" name="Honor-Magic-7-Pro-Dishwasher" alt="The Honor Magic 7 Pro durability tested in a kitchen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zrK2oJANH5u3D24ZByoeP5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>IP68 and IP69 ratings are tricky. In an IP rating, the first number covers dust resistance, while the second number covers water resistance. Phones like the OnePlus 13 and Honor Magic 7 Pro are <em>both</em> IP68 and IP69 rated because these ratings cover two different things:</p><ul><li><strong>IP6X</strong>: Complete protection against dust ingress. In other words, <strong>Dustproof</strong>.</li><li><strong>IPX8</strong>: Protection against continuous immersion in non-salt water beyond 1 meter. <strong>Water-resistant, not waterproof.</strong></li><li><strong>IPX9</strong>: Protection against high-pressure, high-temperature water jets.</li><li><strong>Water-resistant, not waterproof.</strong></li></ul><p>Put these together and you get a phone that's completely dustproof but still only <em>water-resistant</em>. A phone like the OnePlus 13 or Honor Magic 7 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-phone-makers-want-your-smartphone-to-survive-a-kitchen-nightmare">can withstand a kitchen nightmare</a>, but it's not 100% guaranteed to be waterproof in the event of deep or prolonged submersion.</p><p>These phones aren't built to stay in water any deeper or longer than what Samsung offers on its phones, and it seems Samsung has decided that most users aren't going to put their phones in a dishwasher to clean them, so the additional IP69 rating isn't worth the hassle.</p><p>In summary, no, the Galaxy S26 family will <strong>not</strong> be waterproof, but they will almost certainly be IP69 water and dust-resistant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

And these suggest the charging speed will remain mostly unchanged from the existing Samsung Galaxy S25 series phones, tapping out at 45W or 60W for the Ultra variation and 25W for the Pro.</p></article></section><h2 id="how-fast-will-the-samsung-galaxy-s26-charging-speed-be-2">How fast will the Samsung Galaxy S26 charging speed be?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="A9GqkkimZwh3f7Z2iYn7iW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A9GqkkimZwh3f7Z2iYn7iW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's disappointing to learn that, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-rumors-crush-any-hope-for-faster-charging-on-samsungs-next-flagships">according to leaks</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Samsung Galaxy S26 series phones</a> won't have many upgrades in charging speed. Sources suspect that the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro and S26 Edge will tap out at 25W wired charging, which is the same speed as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-fast-samsung-galaxy-s25-charging-speed">S25 series variants</a>.</p><p>The positive news is that the battery is said to be increased from 4,000mAh on the S25 and 3,900mAh on the S25 Edge to 4,200mAh on the upcoming S26. This means the phones may last a bit longer. But when you're ready to charge them, they'll still take the same amount of time, potentially even longer, to get from the red to full.</p><p>What about the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra? That model is said to top out at 45W, the same as the S25 generation Ultra device, although some rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">claim that a bump to 60W</a> may be in the cards. That would be a notable upgrade, but it's a far cry from other Android phone makers that offer bigger batteries, longer life, and faster charging, like models from OnePlus and Xiaomi.</p><p>The upcoming OnePlus 15, for example, is rumored to offer 120W wired charging and 50W wireless, even if it remains unchanged from the existing OnePlus 13, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14" target="_blank">already offers up to 100W wired charging</a>.</p><p>That said, the expected charging speeds of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series phones are still in line with competitors like Google. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-charging-speed">Google Pixel 10 charges at 29W</a>, up from 27W in the Google Pixel 9, while the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL charge at 39W, up from 37W. Outside of the Android camp, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">Apple iPhone 17</a> supports a 40W charger and 25W MagSafe or Qi2 wireless charging.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4026px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-11" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus with a case on and an ESR Qi2 charger attached to the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4026" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for wireless charging, Samsung phones, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review" target="_blank">the S25 Series,</a> have long supported 15W wireless charging and 4.5W reverse wireless. While unconfirmed, it's expected that the Galaxy S26 Series phones will continue this trend. What's unclear is if Samsung will follow suit with Google and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Google Pixel 10 Series</a> and finally integrate magnets into the devices to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">support Qi2 charging</a> without the need for a compatible case or ring accessory. That would at least mark a significant upgrade for those who value wireless charging.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series phones rank among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones in 2025</a>, and the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S26 series will likely snag a spot for 2026 as well.

      <![CDATA[<p>Music streaming services are fantastic at doing a lot of things. They're generally affordable, they offer millions of songs a tap away, and they are superb for discovery and socialization. That's why services like Spotify have nearly 700 million monthly active users, and competitors like Apple Music have over 140 million monthly active users.</p><p>The way you interact with these streaming services is usually through a first-party app, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="spotify android central">Spotify</a> or Tidal on the Google Play Store or Music on iOS. There's one small problem with that, though. When streaming services try to cater their app to meet the needs of nearly a billion people, these apps are unlikely to meet the specific needs of <em>you</em>.</p><p>That's why you should consider keeping your preferred music streaming provider, but giving your music player app a facelift. Usually, we think of custom music player apps from Android as being alternatives to streaming. That doesn't have to be the case.</p><p>There are apps that can tap into services like Spotify, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-music-android">Apple Music</a>, Tidal, Deezer, YouTube Music, and many more â all while providing a more custom and thoughtful listening experience. That's in addition to classic options that leverage audio files stored locally on your device. Over the past few months, I've slowly replaced multiple default music streamers with third-party alternatives, and I think they're worth your time.</p><h2 id="poweramp-is-a-fantastic-on-device-music-player-2">Poweramp is a fantastic on-device music player</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="suadQ2MZjfURMZeMpVmjGE" name="Android-Music-Player-Apps-9" alt="Music player apps running on various Android phones and iPhones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/suadQ2MZjfURMZeMpVmjGE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong></strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxmpz.audioplayer&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Download Poweramp on the Google Play Store</strong></a><strong></strong></li></ul><p>Starting simple, Poweramp is an excellent and well-known local music player for Android. It's ideal for people who don't depend on streaming services for music playback. It could come in handy if you have a large physical media collection that you've transitioned to digital, or for those who prefer high-fidelity source material, like FLACs or ALACs.</p><p>In other words, if you already have the files, Poweramp can play them â no streaming service required. There's a free app, but you'll probably want the paid version that costs a few bucks. It's a one-time fee compared to the perpetual charges from a streaming service.</p><p>Poweramp comes with a lot of features that span use cases far beyond what I require. I opened up my wallet for Poweramp because of its customizable user interface and design language, which includes options to overemphasize, deemphasize, or disable Material You colors entirely. Of course, I also enjoy the complete support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-fi audio</a>, since most of my files are 24-bit, 44.1KHz ALAC.</p><p>It's impossible to list music player alternatives without mentioning Poweramp. However, it's definitely more of a local player than a streamer, even if it does support radio streaming. Considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Google Pixel phones</a> don't have a default music player app and Samsung Music isn't pre-installed on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> anymore, there's a need for a third-party option now more than ever.</p><h2 id="echo-is-a-free-open-source-app-for-streamers-2">Echo is a free, open-source app for streamers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FbycD5tp9MB7TPVG34ANKF" name="Android-Music-Player-Apps-7" alt="Music player apps running on various Android phones and iPhones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FbycD5tp9MB7TPVG34ANKF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong></strong><a href="https://github.com/brahmkshatriya/echo/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank"><strong>Download Echo on GitHub</strong></a><strong></strong></li></ul><p>For streamers, the alternative music player app I recommend is Echo. It's free and open-source, and really is the best of all worlds when it comes to music playback. Echo can handle on-device playback from local files, and is built upon integrations with streaming services as well. The app is extension-based, and you can install extensions for streamers, lyric providers, social apps, and more.</p><p>Echo offers extensions for Deezer, iHeartRadio, Radio Browser, Saavn, Spotify, TuneIn, and YouTube Music. There's Jellyfin support, so you can stream music from your home server or NAS with the Echo app for Android.</p><p>Integration with Lastfm means you can sync data between the Echo player and the tracking service. Rounding out the experience is a long list of lyric database extensions, including Musixmatch and Genius.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hdvo5hsX4Wh23Dpz8hpB7E" name="Android-Music-Player-Apps-8" alt="Music player apps running on various Android phones and iPhones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hdvo5hsX4Wh23Dpz8hpB7E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's fantastic about the Echo app is how it offers quick access to a variety of streamers in one place. You can see your on-device files and streaming library all in one place, or choose to only view specific extensions. So, I can tap the Spotify extension to view my library there, or switch to YouTube Music, or rely on my saved offline files. That's all in just one app.</p><p>The customization features are another benefit, as I detest the look of certain streamers, like YouTube Music and Spotify. With Echo, there's one look for all my streamers. Personally, I think this is the best way to play music on Android, especially if you use multiple music sources.</p><h2 id="albums-is-an-apple-music-client-that-puts-your-catalog-first-2">Albums is an Apple Music client that puts your catalog first</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q5PkrthYGQm9aa4vEec4FF" name="Android-Music-Player-Apps-5" alt="Music player apps running on various Android phones and iPhones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q5PkrthYGQm9aa4vEec4FF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong></strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-music-library-player/id1469948986" target="_blank"><strong>Download Albums on the App Store</strong></a><strong></strong></li></ul><p>I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Albums, the Apple Music client for iOS that sent me down this rabbit hole in the first place. I've almost completely replaced the stock Music app on iOS with a beta version of Albums, which is essentially a remote control for your Apple Music library.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gkQRyD6wLqVaYL8338rmoF" name="Android-Music-Player-Apps-6" alt="Music player apps running on various Android phones and iPhones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gkQRyD6wLqVaYL8338rmoF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An iPhone Air running Albums 2 (left) beside an iPhone 17 Pro running the standard Apple Music app (right).  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It puts the emphasis on albums and their covers, rather than social clutter and discovery features.

They're primarily centered around discovery of new music and social features that cultivate sharing â the more you find and share, the longer you'll stay subscribed and the more likely your friends will, too. It's why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-gets-dms-messages-for-music-lovers-sharing-tracks-and-podcasts">Spotify shipped DMs</a> before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/how-to-enable-spotify-lossless-audio">lossless audio</a>.</p><p>That's why we should get back to the basics with a new music player, like Poweramp, Albums, or Echo. You can have all the perks of streaming without the drawbacks, or use both a default and third-party app in tandem.</p>]]>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Music streaming services are fantastic at doing a lot of things. They're generally affordable, they offer millions of songs a tap away, and they are superb for discovery and socialization. That's why services like Spotify have nearly 700 million monthly active users, and competitors like Apple Music have over 140 million monthly active users.</p><p>The way you interact with these streaming services is usually through a first-party app, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="spotify android central">Spotify</a> or Tidal on the Google Play Store or Music on iOS. There's one small problem with that, though. When streaming services try to cater their app to meet the needs of nearly a billion people, these apps are unlikely to meet the specific needs of <em>you</em>.</p><p>That's why you should consider keeping your preferred music streaming provider, but giving your music player app a facelift. Usually, we think of custom music player apps from Android as being alternatives to streaming. That doesn't have to be the case.</p><p>There are apps that can tap into services like Spotify, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-music-android">Apple Music</a>, Tidal, Deezer, YouTube Music, and many more â all while providing a more custom and thoughtful listening experience. That's in addition to classic options that leverage audio files stored locally on your device. Over the past few months, I've slowly replaced multiple default music streamers with third-party alternatives, and I think they're worth your time.</p><h2 id="poweramp-is-a-fantastic-on-device-music-player-2">Poweramp is a fantastic on-device music player</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="suadQ2MZjfURMZeMpVmjGE" name="Android-Music-Player-Apps-9" alt="Music player apps running on various Android phones and iPhones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/suadQ2MZjfURMZeMpVmjGE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong></strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxmpz.audioplayer&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Download Poweramp on the Google Play Store</strong></a><strong></strong></li></ul><p>Starting simple, Poweramp is an excellent and well-known local music player for Android. It's ideal for people who don't depend on streaming services for music playback. It could come in handy if you have a large physical media collection that you've transitioned to digital, or for those who prefer high-fidelity source material, like FLACs or ALACs.</p><p>In other words, if you already have the files, Poweramp can play them â no streaming service required. There's a free app, but you'll probably want the paid version that costs a few bucks. It's a one-time fee compared to the perpetual charges from a streaming service.</p><p>Poweramp comes with a lot of features that span use cases far beyond what I require. I opened up my wallet for Poweramp because of its customizable user interface and design language, which includes options to overemphasize, deemphasize, or disable Material You colors entirely. Of course, I also enjoy the complete support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-fi audio</a>, since most of my files are 24-bit, 44.1KHz ALAC.</p><p>It's impossible to list music player alternatives without mentioning Poweramp.

The Galaxy S25 Ultra remains at the top of its class in performance, largely thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>. This is paired with 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage.</p><p>It's likely to be much of the same story with the Galaxy S26 Ultra, with one obvious change. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> was recently announced at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit, and we expect this to be the chip powering Samsung's 2026 flagship. The only difference is that we also expect it to be slightly tweaked, while sporting the "for Galaxy" branding.</p><p>Here's a look at the expected specs of the Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. the Galaxy S25 Ultra:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB / 16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 1TB UFS 4.0 (or UFS 4.1)</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB / 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>12MP 3x telephoto</p></td><td  ><p>10MP 3x telephoto</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 4</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 5x telephoto</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 5x telephoto</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP wide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6GHz, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, UWB, Bluetooth 6.0</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6GHz, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, UWB, Bluetooth 5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>45W or 60W wired, Qi 2.2 Magnetic Compatibility w/ 25W wireless speeds</p></td><td  ><p>45W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>163.4 x 77.9 x 7.9mm</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>217 grams</p></td><td  ><p>218 grams</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8.5 w/ Android 16 QPR2</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8 w/ Android 16</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>There is another rumored change: the Galaxy S26 Ultra is offered with 16GB of RAM instead of 12GB. Doing so would put it in line with Google's Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, and could provide some "wiggle room" for any future Gemini or Galaxy AI features in the pipeline.</p><p>Another area where we're hoping to see Samsung match up with Google is in charging capabilities. Although the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Z Fold 7 are Qi2 compatible, they aren't equipped with faster wireless charging speeds or built-in magnets. Instead, you still currently need to rely on a case (or adapter) if you want to enjoy magnetic accessories.</p><p>Some rumors suggest this will be rectified with the S26 Ultra, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">it's said to support the Qi 2.2 standard</a>. With that, we could have proper magnetic accessory compatibility, along with faster 25W wireless charging speeds, and potentially even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">60W wired charging</a>. However, it's also worth noting that while many signs point to faster charging, Samsung will likely stick to the 5,000mAh battery size.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-3" alt="Close-up on Galaxy S25 Ultra camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>More changes are likely to come to the Galaxy S26 Ultra's camera system, and not just in the slight differences in the rear camera alignment. On paper, the S26 Ultra may share a similar quad rear-camera setup, with a 200MP main wide-angle lens, a 3x telephoto, 50MP 5x telephoto, and 50MP ultrawide sensors.</p><p>It's likely that Samsung will implement the latest version of its 200MP main lens; there was excitement for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-points-to-a-sweet-camera-upgrade-for-your-close-up-shots">potential upgrade</a> to the 3x telephoto camera. It was said that Samsung would be using an upgraded 12MP lens, offering more detail and capturing more light than before.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And while multiple rumors agree that the 12MP will be implemented, it won't provide the upgrade we had hoped. Instead, it's said that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-hints-downgrades-3x-zoom-camera">Samsung will crop</a> the 12MP sensor down to 10MP. Not only that, but as a result of cropping to a smaller sensor, this could mean fewer details and light would be captured than what the Galaxy S25 Ultra can produce.</p><p>It's not all disappointing news, however, with rumors pointing to Samsung introducing its own "APV codec." This stands for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-advanced-professional-video-codec-is-coming-with-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-do-you-need-this">Advanced Professional Video</a>, and is said to "preserve far better than existing options while keeping storage demands in check."

Especially considering that we'll likely see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-best-prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-big-deal-days-2025">variety of deals</a> for the Galaxy S25 Ultra that make it as cheap, if not cheaper, than the pre-order deals were available.</p><p>Not to mention that we don't know if Samsung is planning on any surprise price hikes, as that seems to be a going trend nowadays. However, even if the Galaxy S26 Ultra is more expensive than the S25 Ultra was at launch, we can't imagine it would be by more than $100. And while that's not an insignificant amount, there likely aren't many groundbreaking upgrades to warrant anything more.</p><p>All of this is to say, if you want the absolute best that Android has to offer, wait a couple more months. If Samsung's past schedule is anything to go by, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should likely arrive sometime in late January or early February. At which point, you'll be able to see all of the cards in the deck, plus, if you'd still prefer the S25 Ultra, it'll probably be even less expensive.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7dd3ce3f-c778-45f1-9592-70dea57b39ee">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7aPuds4bUohAeDeEDRcqi.jpg' alt="samsung galaxy s25 ultra square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The incumbent</strong></em></p><p>If you're looking to upgrade, now might seem to be the best time to grab the Galaxy S25 Ultra.

The Galaxy S25 Ultra remains at the top of its class in performance, largely thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>. This is paired with 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage.</p><p>It's likely to be much of the same story with the Galaxy S26 Ultra, with one obvious change. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> was recently announced at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit, and we expect this to be the chip powering Samsung's 2026 flagship. The only difference is that we also expect it to be slightly tweaked, while sporting the "for Galaxy" branding.</p><p>Here's a look at the expected specs of the Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. the Galaxy S25 Ultra:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB / 16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 1TB UFS 4.0 (or UFS 4.1)</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB / 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>12MP 3x telephoto</p></td><td  ><p>10MP 3x telephoto</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 4</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 5x telephoto</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 5x telephoto</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP wide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6GHz, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, UWB, Bluetooth 6.0</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6GHz, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, UWB, Bluetooth 5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>45W or 60W wired, Qi 2.2 Magnetic Compatibility w/ 25W wireless speeds</p></td><td  ><p>45W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>163.4 x 77.9 x 7.9mm</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>217 grams</p></td><td  ><p>218 grams</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8.5 w/ Android 16 QPR2</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8 w/ Android 16</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>There is another rumored change: the Galaxy S26 Ultra is offered with 16GB of RAM instead of 12GB. Doing so would put it in line with Google's Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, and could provide some "wiggle room" for any future Gemini or Galaxy AI features in the pipeline.</p><p>Another area where we're hoping to see Samsung match up with Google is in charging capabilities. Although the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Z Fold 7 are Qi2 compatible, they aren't equipped with faster wireless charging speeds or built-in magnets. Instead, you still currently need to rely on a case (or adapter) if you want to enjoy magnetic accessories.</p><p>Some rumors suggest this will be rectified with the S26 Ultra, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">it's said to support the Qi 2.2 standard</a>. With that, we could have proper magnetic accessory compatibility, along with faster 25W wireless charging speeds, and potentially even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">60W wired charging</a>. However, it's also worth noting that while many signs point to faster charging, Samsung will likely stick to the 5,000mAh battery size.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-3" alt="Close-up on Galaxy S25 Ultra camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>More changes are likely to come to the Galaxy S26 Ultra's camera system, and not just in the slight differences in the rear camera alignment. On paper, the S26 Ultra may share a similar quad rear-camera setup, with a 200MP main wide-angle lens, a 3x telephoto, 50MP 5x telephoto, and 50MP ultrawide sensors.</p><p>It's likely that Samsung will implement the latest version of its 200MP main lens; there was excitement for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-points-to-a-sweet-camera-upgrade-for-your-close-up-shots">potential upgrade</a> to the 3x telephoto camera. It was said that Samsung would be using an upgraded 12MP lens, offering more detail and capturing more light than before.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And while multiple rumors agree that the 12MP will be implemented, it won't provide the upgrade we had hoped. Instead, it's said that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-hints-downgrades-3x-zoom-camera">Samsung will crop</a> the 12MP sensor down to 10MP. Not only that, but as a result of cropping to a smaller sensor, this could mean fewer details and light would be captured than what the Galaxy S25 Ultra can produce.</p><p>It's not all disappointing news, however, with rumors pointing to Samsung introducing its own "APV codec." This stands for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-advanced-professional-video-codec-is-coming-with-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-do-you-need-this">Advanced Professional Video</a>, and is said to "preserve far better than existing options while keeping storage demands in check."

However, even if the Galaxy S26 Ultra is more expensive than the S25 Ultra was at launch, we can't imagine it would be by more than $100. And while that's not an insignificant amount, there likely aren't many groundbreaking upgrades to warrant anything more.</p><p>All of this is to say, if you want the absolute best that Android has to offer, wait a couple more months. If Samsung's past schedule is anything to go by, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should likely arrive sometime in late January or early February. At which point, you'll be able to see all of the cards in the deck, plus, if you'd still prefer the S25 Ultra, it'll probably be even less expensive.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7dd3ce3f-c778-45f1-9592-70dea57b39ee">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7aPuds4bUohAeDeEDRcqi.jpg' alt="samsung galaxy s25 ultra square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The incumbent</strong></em></p><p>If you're looking to upgrade, now might seem to be the best time to grab the Galaxy S25 Ultra.

Or should you wait until the Galaxy S26 Ultra is unveiled first?</p><p>Since Samsung has yet to make it official, all we currently have to go on is a combination of leaks, rumors, and intuition, but we hope to help you decide.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-lineup" alt="CAD renders of the Galaxy S26 lineup including the Ultra and Pro models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the past couple of years, Samsung has been ditching the curved edges and flattening out its flagship smartphone.

The Galaxy S25 Ultra remains at the top of its class in performance, largely thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>. This is paired with 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage.</p><p>It's likely to be much of the same story with the Galaxy S26 Ultra, with one obvious change. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> was recently announced at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit, and we expect this to be the chip powering Samsung's 2026 flagship.

Doing so would put it in line with Google's Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, and could provide some "wiggle room" for any future Gemini or Galaxy AI features in the pipeline.</p><p>Another area where we're hoping to see Samsung match up with Google is in charging capabilities. Although the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Z Fold 7 are Qi2 compatible, they aren't equipped with faster wireless charging speeds or built-in magnets. Instead, you still currently need to rely on a case (or adapter) if you want to enjoy magnetic accessories.</p><p>Some rumors suggest this will be rectified with the S26 Ultra, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">it's said to support the Qi 2.2 standard</a>. With that, we could have proper magnetic accessory compatibility, along with faster 25W wireless charging speeds, and potentially even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">60W wired charging</a>. However, it's also worth noting that while many signs point to faster charging, Samsung will likely stick to the 5,000mAh battery size.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-3" alt="Close-up on Galaxy S25 Ultra camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>More changes are likely to come to the Galaxy S26 Ultra's camera system, and not just in the slight differences in the rear camera alignment. On paper, the S26 Ultra may share a similar quad rear-camera setup, with a 200MP main wide-angle lens, a 3x telephoto, 50MP 5x telephoto, and 50MP ultrawide sensors.</p><p>It's likely that Samsung will implement the latest version of its 200MP main lens; there was excitement for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-points-to-a-sweet-camera-upgrade-for-your-close-up-shots">potential upgrade</a> to the 3x telephoto camera. It was said that Samsung would be using an upgraded 12MP lens, offering more detail and capturing more light than before.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And while multiple rumors agree that the 12MP will be implemented, it won't provide the upgrade we had hoped. Instead, it's said that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-hints-downgrades-3x-zoom-camera">Samsung will crop</a> the 12MP sensor down to 10MP. Not only that, but as a result of cropping to a smaller sensor, this could mean fewer details and light would be captured than what the Galaxy S25 Ultra can produce.</p><p>It's not all disappointing news, however, with rumors pointing to Samsung introducing its own "APV codec." This stands for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-advanced-professional-video-codec-is-coming-with-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-do-you-need-this">Advanced Professional Video</a>, and is said to "preserve far better than existing options while keeping storage demands in check." If that sounds kind of familiar, it's not all that dissimilar to what Apple ProRes offers when recording video on the iPhone.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-is-it-worth-waiting-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Is it worth waiting?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CJ3tKHPmEXBczgC7e3A7iW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJ3tKHPmEXBczgC7e3A7iW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are plenty of questions that even the rumors and leaks have yet to answer regarding the Galaxy S26 Ultra, making the decision that much more difficult. Especially considering that we'll likely see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-best-prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-big-deal-days-2025">variety of deals</a> for the Galaxy S25 Ultra that make it as cheap, if not cheaper, than the pre-order deals were available.</p><p>Not to mention that we don't know if Samsung is planning on any surprise price hikes, as that seems to be a going trend nowadays. However, even if the Galaxy S26 Ultra is more expensive than the S25 Ultra was at launch, we can't imagine it would be by more than $100. And while that's not an insignificant amount, there likely aren't many groundbreaking upgrades to warrant anything more.</p><p>All of this is to say, if you want the absolute best that Android has to offer, wait a couple more months. If Samsung's past schedule is anything to go by, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should likely arrive sometime in late January or early February. At which point, you'll be able to see all of the cards in the deck, plus, if you'd still prefer the S25 Ultra, it'll probably be even less expensive.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7dd3ce3f-c778-45f1-9592-70dea57b39ee">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7aPuds4bUohAeDeEDRcqi.jpg' alt="samsung galaxy s25 ultra square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The incumbent</strong></em></p><p>If you're looking to upgrade, now might seem to be the best time to grab the Galaxy S25 Ultra.

      <![CDATA[<p>There's no question that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo's X200 Pro</a> continues one of the best phones of 2025. The design is elegant, it has top-notch hardware, a massive battery, and of the best camera systems on any phone today. I liked the X200 Pro so much that I used it more than any other device this year.</p><p>If there was one thing that Vivo needed to address, it was the software. While Funtouch OS 15 got a fresh coat of paint, it was clear that the interface was lagging behind OriginOS, Vivo's China-exclusive software.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the X300 and X300 Pro, Vivo is addressing that issue â these devices mark the global debut of OriginOS. There are other changes to the X300 and X300 Pro that make the phones stand out from their predecessors. I used both the X300 and X300 Pro for the better part of a day ahead of the global launch in Shanghai, China; I got the Chinese unit of the X300, and the global model of the X300 Pro that will make its way to select regions globally in the coming weeks.</p><p>While Vivo didn't share global pricing just yet, we know what these devices cost in China. The X300 starts at 4,399RMB ($618), and the X300 Pro debuts at 5,299RMB ($745). Both phones start with 256GB of storage, and go up to 1TB.</p><h2 id="same-great-design-even-better-2">Same great design, even better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SkJd3oXedDy6DRE5ftWQER" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SkJd3oXedDy6DRE5ftWQER.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo hasn't changed the design of the X300 Pro too much, and it looks similar to its predecessor. That's a good thing, and what I like is that mid-frame has a matte texture now, making it easier to hold and use the device. On that note, the back also has a matte finish, and the in-hand feel is noticeably better than the X200 Pro.

However, I didn't notice that because of the oversized camera island that dominates the design at the back. The island juts out considerably, but it is centered, so there isn't any wobble when using the phone.</p><h2 id="cameras-that-shine-2">Cameras that shine </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q26dKzSJ2Y3eDB7mbDm4PR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q26dKzSJ2Y3eDB7mbDm4PR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In fact, the camera island is nearly identical to that on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>, and this is by design.

There are other changes to the X300 and X300 Pro that make the phones stand out from their predecessors. I used both the X300 and X300 Pro for the better part of a day ahead of the global launch in Shanghai, China; I got the Chinese unit of the X300, and the global model of the X300 Pro that will make its way to select regions globally in the coming weeks.</p><p>While Vivo didn't share global pricing just yet, we know what these devices cost in China. The X300 starts at 4,399RMB ($618), and the X300 Pro debuts at 5,299RMB ($745). Both phones start with 256GB of storage, and go up to 1TB.</p><h2 id="same-great-design-even-better-2">Same great design, even better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SkJd3oXedDy6DRE5ftWQER" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SkJd3oXedDy6DRE5ftWQER.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo hasn't changed the design of the X300 Pro too much, and it looks similar to its predecessor.

The X300 Pro is a smidgen shorter and narrower than the X200 Pro, and coming in at 7.9mm, it is thinner as well. However, I didn't notice that because of the oversized camera island that dominates the design at the back. The island juts out considerably, but it is centered, so there isn't any wobble when using the phone.</p><h2 id="cameras-that-shine-2">Cameras that shine </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q26dKzSJ2Y3eDB7mbDm4PR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q26dKzSJ2Y3eDB7mbDm4PR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In fact, the camera island is nearly identical to that on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>, and this is by design.

The wide-angle lens is still the 50MP JN1, which is unchanged for two years now. You get the same JN1 module acting as the selfie lens as well, similar to last year.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row

While Funtouch OS 15 got a fresh coat of paint, it was clear that the interface was lagging behind OriginOS, Vivo's China-exclusive software.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the X300 and X300 Pro, Vivo is addressing that issue â these devices mark the global debut of OriginOS. There are other changes to the X300 and X300 Pro that make the phones stand out from their predecessors. I used both the X300 and X300 Pro for the better part of a day ahead of the global launch in Shanghai, China; I got the Chinese unit of the X300, and the global model of the X300 Pro that will make its way to select regions globally in the coming weeks.</p><p>While Vivo didn't share global pricing just yet, we know what these devices cost in China. The X300 starts at 4,399RMB ($618), and the X300 Pro debuts at 5,299RMB ($745). Both phones start with 256GB of storage, and go up to 1TB.</p><h2 id="same-great-design-even-better-2">Same great design, even better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SkJd3oXedDy6DRE5ftWQER" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SkJd3oXedDy6DRE5ftWQER.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo hasn't changed the design of the X300 Pro too much, and it looks similar to its predecessor.

The wide-angle lens is still the 50MP JN1, which is unchanged for two years now.

      <![CDATA[<p>Enjoy our content? Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Like clockwork, Apple introduced a new set of iPhones this September. But the highlight of the "Awe Dropping" keynote for me wasn't the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 lineup</a> or even the Apple Watch Series 11. It was the new AirPods Pro 3.</p><p>As an Android user for the past few years, I've always been a bit envious of how seamlessly the AirPods work within the Apple ecosystem. You can effortlessly switch between devices, enjoy that sleek connection animation every time you open the case, and experience some of the best active noise cancellation on any earbuds.</p><p>Sure, Android has plenty of strong contenders, too. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> and Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are both excellent wireless earbuds, and there are equally impressive options from brands like Bose and Sony, including the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/i-used-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-for-a-month">QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2</a> and Sony WF-1000XM5.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xoiyRb6NYBZqjTiHQuqhgM" name="airpods-pro-3-3" alt="AirPods Pro 3 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xoiyRb6NYBZqjTiHQuqhgM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/airpods-pro-3-vs-google-pixel-buds-pro-2-best-for-live-translate">AirPods Pro 3</a> were the turning point for me. After avoiding them for years, I finally bought them â and there's no doubt they're impressive. The active noise cancellation is truly top-tier.</p><p>I took two flights wearing them, and there was virtually no cabin noise at all. My Pixel Buds Pro 2 have been great at cutting down ambient sounds during travel, but this was on another level.</p><p>But that's not the feature I want other brands to copy. Earbuds will keep getting better at noise cancellation with each new generation, but the feature that genuinely blew me away on the AirPods Pro 3 is the built-in heart rate tracking.</p><h2 id="airpods-pro-3-can-now-track-your-workouts-too-2">AirPods Pro 3 can now track your workouts too</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uZ4AesiDxXvTXU5RJkY4KM" name="airpods-pro-3-2" alt="AirPods Pro 3 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uZ4AesiDxXvTXU5RJkY4KM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the new features Apple has added to the AirPods Pro 3 is an optical heart rate sensor. This means you can now use the AirPods Pro 3 to track your workouts. Similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">other fitness trackers</a>, the heart rate sensor flashes light to measure blood flow through the ear canal and shares that data with the iPhone's Fitness app.</p><p>The app then uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> to calculate workout metrics such as calories burned, steps taken, and distance covered. Apple even claims that the AirPods Pro 3 can track over fifty workouts, including running, yoga, and strength training.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SsTamjCr8e93Gcjk5FX9qJ" name="airpods-pro-3-workout-tracking-1" alt="Workout tracking in AirPods Pro 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SsTamjCr8e93Gcjk5FX9qJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And while it may sound strange to track workouts using earbuds instead of traditional fitness trackers or smartwatches, it's actually a pretty smart idea. The ear is actually a pretty stable location for heart rate monitoring, as the sensors are close to major arteries and less affected by movement during intense activity.</p><p>Apple also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-airpods-pro-3-the-ultimate-audio-experience/">says</a> that when both the AirPods Pro 3 and an Apple Watch are connected to your iPhone, the system automatically uses data from whichever device provides the most accurate readings at any given moment. This ensures the best coverage and accuracy throughout your workout.</p><p>That said, I decided to use the AirPods Pro 3 as my only health-tracking device for over a week, comparing it directly with a dedicated fitness tracker. And here's how the AirPods performed and whether they can really be considered reliable fitness trackers.</p><h2 id="how-reliable-is-the-airpods-pro-3-s-heart-rate-tracking-2">How reliable is the AirPods Pro 3's heart rate tracking?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="88t4GthGxRsZAT3pe46LzM" name="airpods-pro-3-1" alt="AirPods Pro 3 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/88t4GthGxRsZAT3pe46LzM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since I already wear the AirPods Pro 3 throughout my workout sessions, being able to track workouts means I can skip fitness wearables on my wrist, which feels like a win-win for me.</p><p>To truly assess whether the AirPods Pro 3 is a reliable fitness tracker, I tested them against another fitness tracker, the Huawei Watch Fit 4 Pro, which I paired with a different smartphone to prevent my iPhone from mixing the data.

This ensures the best coverage and accuracy throughout your workout.</p><p>That said, I decided to use the AirPods Pro 3 as my only health-tracking device for over a week, comparing it directly with a dedicated fitness tracker. And here's how the AirPods performed and whether they can really be considered reliable fitness trackers.</p><h2 id="how-reliable-is-the-airpods-pro-3-s-heart-rate-tracking-2">How reliable is the AirPods Pro 3's heart rate tracking?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="88t4GthGxRsZAT3pe46LzM" name="airpods-pro-3-1" alt="AirPods Pro 3 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/88t4GthGxRsZAT3pe46LzM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since I already wear the AirPods Pro 3 throughout my workout sessions, being able to track workouts means I can skip fitness wearables on my wrist, which feels like a win-win for me.</p><p>To truly assess whether the AirPods Pro 3 is a reliable fitness tracker, I tested them against another fitness tracker, the Huawei Watch Fit 4 Pro, which I paired with a different smartphone to prevent my iPhone from mixing the data. My goal was to see if the two devices recorded similar results, and the outcome was surprisingly close.</p><p>For context, my workouts usually include a mix of strength training, cardio, and stretching. Even on other fitness devices, I typically select the "Other" workout mode so I don't have to switch between multiple modes during my hour-long sessions.</p><p>I followed the same setup for this test. I started my workout on both devices at the same time and compared their heart rate and calorie readings throughout.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="evoBgYHUXT39hDQHvExdMD" name="airpods-pro-3-vs-fitness-tracker-2" alt="AirPods Pro 3 vs a fitness tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/evoBgYHUXT39hDQHvExdMD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4ws5MsQLnvywNzfr9UAWKD" name="airpods-pro-3-vs-fitness-tracker-3" alt="AirPods Pro 3 vs a fitness tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ws5MsQLnvywNzfr9UAWKD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rnZQ4ZrTvRh4Q9jVJdHELD" name="airpods-pro-3-vs-fitness-tracker-4" alt="AirPods Pro 3 vs a fitness tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rnZQ4ZrTvRh4Q9jVJdHELD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TPXhjb8iqjmcxiycAZUVCD" name="airpods-pro-3-vs-fitness-tracker-1" alt="AirPods Pro 3 vs a fitness tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TPXhjb8iqjmcxiycAZUVCD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>To my surprise, the heart rate numbers from both the AirPods Pro 3 and the Huawei Watch Fit 4 Pro were almost identical every time I checked. The calorie estimates were slightly different, which makes sense since each device uses its own algorithm to estimate calories burned. What impressed me was how well the AirPods tracked workout intensity and rhythm through the ear.</p><p>The heart rate is a direct physiological metric, while calorie burn depends more on how each device interprets your body data. The fact that the AirPods Pro 3 matched a dedicated fitness tracker in real-time heart rate accuracy was genuinely impressive.</p><p>For most people, especially casual gym-goers or those who don't like wearing a smartwatch, this level of precision is more than enough, in my opinion. You can simply pop in your AirPods, start your workout, and still get meaningful insights without any extra gear.</p><p>Of course, if you're looking for advanced fitness tracking, something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/whoop-no-intention-dropping-its-blood-pressure-insights-fda-report">Whoop</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> will still be the better choice.

What a shame.â</p><p>Okay, letâs get it out of the way: yes, the color is nearly identical to the recently launched iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange. But I want to point out that Samsung did have an orange colorway called Titanium Orange on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, and Google had the Oh So Orange colorway for its Pixel 4.

Google announced the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-5-looks-back-basics-model-we-can-get-excited-about"> Pixel 5</a> in the Sorta Sage colorway on October 15, 2020, while Apple announced the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/iphone-12-step-behind-android-competition-5g-battery-tests"> iPhone 12 </a>in the Green color, which is <em>extremely</em> similar to Sorta Sage, but it was announced on October 23, 2020.</p><p>But who cares? Just because one company does it and another does something similar doesnât mean itâs a sell-out company. One poster wrote, âSamsungâs target audience is Apple users. Itâs not surprising. So much of what they have done over the past few years has been to convince iPhone folks to switch over.â</p><p>This statement shouldnât really be surprising to anyone. While Apple remains ahead of Samsung in overall market share in North America, weâve recently seen a dip in performance.</p><p>Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna225435">data from Canalys</a>, Appleâs market share in Q2 of 2025 saw a dip from 56% to 49%, while Samsungâs surged from 23% to 31%. Granted, this could be due to developments in Samsungâs foldable phone category, where Apple hasnât made any moves.</p><h2 id="the-nature-of-the-market-2">The nature of the market</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Ug94ZK8FKYyyEaSpBPojUR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ug94ZK8FKYyyEaSpBPojUR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What irks me the most about this Reddit post is that if the tables were turned and Apple stole something from Samsung, the Android fanboys would be all over Apple, claiming the company only steals ideas. Or they might chastise the company for trying to do what Android has already done without giving credit where itâs due.</p><p>What they fail to understand is that this is how companies compete with each other. The only way theyâre going to change market share is by looking at what another company is doing right.</p><p>If the past complaint from iPhone users was that it was hard to switch to an Android phone, then Samsung or Google needs to figure out how to change this. And theyâve done that. Theyâve made it easy for iPhone users to switch over because thatâs the name of the game: who can get the highest market share and have the most popular device out there.</p><div class="instagram-embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned  data-instgrm-version="6" style="width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPlIWLkkr0F/" target="_blank">A post shared by OnePlus (@oneplus)</a></p><p>A photo posted by  on </p></blockquote></div><p>More recently, weâve also seen Android OS emulate many similarities to iOS (even OnePlus's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygen-os-16-looks-a-lot-like-ios-teasers-confirm-its-launch">Oxygen OS 16 preview</a> looks a lot like Apple's iOS, especially with the multitasking and icon colors).<em><strong> </strong></em>And like another Reddit user wrote: âGet ready for a liquid glass-like animation,â I couldnât agree more. I wonât be surprised when we start to see this on the next Samsung or Pixel device.</p><h2 id="originality-has-left-the-chat-2">Originality has left the chat</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, this is the new reality. Gone are the days when there was only one smartphone of its kind in town, and other companies had the opportunity to create something new and different. Weâre at a point where the saturation of devices in the market is so high that itâs really hard to be different every single year.</p><p>Of course, some companies have managed to redefine themselves and the way they have improved on phone technologies, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-has-best-android-software-no-one-talks-about">Motorola</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whats-bad-huawei-good-companies-xiaomi-and-oppo">Xiaomi</a>. But the reality is that theyâre not as big as Samsung or Apple. And to try to get more people on board with these brands is hard.</p><p>Expanding to other form factors, such as foldables or thin phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on" target="_blank">Samsung S25 Edge </a>or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-air-is-the-coolest-phone-i-used-in-2025" target="_blank">iPhone Air</a>, has been an area to create new competitive markets. But even then, developing on those ideas will die at some point because companies have reached a point of not being able to create more on top of what theyâve already done, and so itâs on to the next project.</p><h2 id="that-said-the-colors-really-do-matter-2">That said, the colors really do matter!</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="WkEf6GUsy4vTHLJKuUCE3R" name="Pixel-10-series-boquet" alt="Pixel 10 series shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:909,l:0,cw:5712,ch:3213,q:80/WkEf6GUsy4vTHLJKuUCE3R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="4284" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Iâll leave you with one last point to mull over. While originality is at the cost of creating more products to compete, I will say originality with color shouldnât be something you should be concerned with.</p><p>One of my favorite phone colors was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5-things-iphone-11-pro-should-come-android-phones">iPhone 11 Pro</a> in Midnight Green. At the same time, I have been a die-hard fan of the more recently released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/theres-one-key-reason-the-pixel-10-pro-is-my-main-camera-for-work">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> in Moonstone. I would have killed for a beautiful forest green variant of the device.</p><p>Companies are thoughtful; they carefully consider what the public wants and what appeals to the eyes of users. So if Samsung does end up releasing the S26 Ultra in that gorgeous orange color, thereâs a very strong reason it decided to do so.</p>]]>

The column looks to expand and go in-depth on topics in the Android space without any limitations.</p></div></div><p>Last week, a Reddit user took to the platform to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-may-feature-apples-bold-cosmic-orange-leaks-reveal">complain about a Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra leak </a>that showcased three phones with different colorways, of which one was in a striking bright orange popsicle color.</p><p>The user posted that they were âso done with this orange color tbhâ¦,â which then resulted in a slew of commenters agreeing and saying âthat color has to be a joke,â or that Samsung is âtotally Appleâs copycat. What a shame.â</p><p>Okay, letâs get it out of the way: yes, the color is nearly identical to the recently launched iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange. But I want to point out that Samsung did have an orange colorway called Titanium Orange on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, and Google had the Oh So Orange colorway for its Pixel 4. Both of these phones launched much earlier than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> color.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/comments/1o022sc/dummies_of_galaxy_s26_ultra_leaked_online_guys_im">Dummies of Galaxy S26 Ultra leaked online. Guys, I'm so done with this orange colour tbhâ¦</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy">r/samsunggalaxy</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Iâm about to get really granular here. Google announced the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-5-looks-back-basics-model-we-can-get-excited-about"> Pixel 5</a> in the Sorta Sage colorway on October 15, 2020, while Apple announced the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/iphone-12-step-behind-android-competition-5g-battery-tests"> iPhone 12 </a>in the Green color, which is <em>extremely</em> similar to Sorta Sage, but it was announced on October 23, 2020.</p><p>But who cares? Just because one company does it and another does something similar doesnât mean itâs a sell-out company. One poster wrote, âSamsungâs target audience is Apple users. Itâs not surprising. So much of what they have done over the past few years has been to convince iPhone folks to switch over.â</p><p>This statement shouldnât really be surprising to anyone.

As someone who's tested nearly every smartwatch and fitness watch brand, I put the Watch 4 through its paces to see how well its accuracy holds up against a premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>, judging when Fitbit beats the competition and when it falls short.</p><p>I took the Pixel Watch 4 out for a half-marathon and a second 19-mile run â along with shorter runs and a hike â comparing its HR accuracy against a chest strap and its GPS accuracy against the dual-band <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Garmin Forerunner 970</a>.</p><p>I also compared stats like step count, elevation, and running form, tested how Google's new activity detection works, and decided whether the Watch 4's new 3,000-nit display and improved battery life make a real difference.</p><p>I can't <em>fully</em> judge the Watch 4 fitness experience until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/fitbit/fitbit-ai-personal-health-coach-preview/">Gemini-backed Fitbit coach</a> arrives later this month. But it's fair to say the Watch 4 is a surprisingly strong fitness watch option â even if it's still missing some essentials that serious athletes need.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gps-accuracy"><span>GPS accuracy</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BrKk4JjhhU2VmW9TfT7Wwh" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-vs-Garmin-Forerunner-970" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 4 (left, on a table) showing a post-run summary of distance, time, pace, and HR, while the Garmin Forerunner 970 (right) shows distance, time, and pace with a GPS map.

It's also more efficient than I expected, only using about 7.5% of my battery per hour of tracking for a couple of runs.

But the upcoming Fitbit AI coach should challenge Garmin with Gemini-made customized coaching plans that adjust based on your sleep quality, soreness, or if you tell Gemini you're injured.</p><p>While Google has an edge for AI â it's not controversial to say Gemini will be much smarter than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin's Connect Plus AI</a>, which only summarizes your stats using an LLM â it still falls short for other training basics.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NbGJRz4ELSwnKYk52nmJuJ" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-mapping-route" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing a course route on a detailed city map." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NbGJRz4ELSwnKYk52nmJuJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm still waiting for Google to use its Maps advantage for fitness.

That's all well and good for Premium subscribers.</p><p>But the watch itself will only judge your strength workouts on basics like heart rate and calories burned, whereas Garmin tracks individual reps for each exercise type, such as bench presses.

As someone who's tested nearly every smartwatch and fitness watch brand, I put the Watch 4 through its paces to see how well its accuracy holds up against a premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>, judging when Fitbit beats the competition and when it falls short.</p><p>I took the Pixel Watch 4 out for a half-marathon and a second 19-mile run â along with shorter runs and a hike â comparing its HR accuracy against a chest strap and its GPS accuracy against the dual-band <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Garmin Forerunner 970</a>.</p><p>I also compared stats like step count, elevation, and running form, tested how Google's new activity detection works, and decided whether the Watch 4's new 3,000-nit display and improved battery life make a real difference.</p><p>I can't <em>fully</em> judge the Watch 4 fitness experience until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/fitbit/fitbit-ai-personal-health-coach-preview/">Gemini-backed Fitbit coach</a> arrives later this month. But it's fair to say the Watch 4 is a surprisingly strong fitness watch option â even if it's still missing some essentials that serious athletes need.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gps-accuracy"><span>GPS accuracy</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BrKk4JjhhU2VmW9TfT7Wwh" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-vs-Garmin-Forerunner-970" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 4 (left, on a table) showing a post-run summary of distance, time, pace, and HR, while the Garmin Forerunner 970 (right) shows distance, time, and pace with a GPS map.

I didn't get a chance to climb a mountain or anything, but I generally trust its results.</p><p>Overall, the Pixel Watch 4's GPS accuracy is as dependable as I hoped. It's also more efficient than I expected, only using about 7.5% of my battery per hour of tracking for a couple of runs.

The final result: Garmin measured 0.02mi more and COROS 0.01mi more than Google, all with the same 9:23/mile average. I'll spare you 19 miles' worth of screenshots, but this was the Watch 4's best tracking result, with only the occasional sections where it strayed off-path.</p><p>On a related note, the Pixel Watch 4's elevation tracking was only 0.8 feet off of Garmin's for the 19-mile run, though the gap was 3m for my half-marathon. I didn't get a chance to climb a mountain or anything, but I generally trust its results.</p><p>Overall, the Pixel Watch 4's GPS accuracy is as dependable as I hoped. It's also more efficient than I expected, only using about 7.5% of my battery per hour of tracking for a couple of runs. It guzzled more battery during my 19-mile run, hitting closer to 12% battery used per hour, but still had more than enough juice for a long activity.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-hr-accuracy"><span>HR accuracy</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XLipw7DBBpETX5ibvj59gF" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-HR-Tile" alt="The 45mm Google Pixel Watch 4 on a man's wrist showing the Heart Rate tile, showing a HR high and low on a graph, with the current HR (66) below the graph." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XLipw7DBBpETX5ibvj59gF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google promised that the Pixel Watch 3 had its "most accurate" HR algorithm, and didn't bring it up with the Watch 4, so we can safely assume it's unchanged.

You can see how both watches respond to changes in effort at nearly the same time throughout a 40-minute run. Still, Google's results are slightly deflated, once again 1 bpm short on average.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1922px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.72%;"><img id="kGua4eFTGYSsRDgnYCDJtN" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-vs-Garmin-HRM-200-HR-test" alt="A HR graph showing how the Google Pixel Watch 4 and Garmin HRM 200 compare for HR accuracy across a three-hour run." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kGua4eFTGYSsRDgnYCDJtN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1922" height="994" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For my 19-mile run, I synced my Garmin HRM 200 chest strap to my Forerunner. You can ignore the three flat-line stretches; different watches handle paused workouts for water and bathroom breaks differently. Otherwise, you can see how the Watch 4 mostly keeps pace but still falls 1â2 bpm short during rapid changes. The final averages â Watch 4 with 161 bpm, HRM 200 with 162 bpm â were predictable at this point.</p><p>I gave the Pixel Watch 3's HR accuracy a "B" grade last year, and I'd give them the same grade this year: good but not exceptional. The real problem is that Google doesn't give people a way to improve their results, as Wear OS doesn't support connecting to external HR monitors.

After that whiplash, we're back where we started, and I've typically found that Fitbit step counts tend to fall slightly short of my actual numbers.</p><p>Someone would have to bribe me to count my steps during a half-marathon, but I found it interesting that my final step count on my Garmin (23,041) was significantly higher than on my Pixel Watch (21,852). For my 19-mile run, the gap was smaller (34,260 vs. 33,960), with Garmin still estimating more.</p><p>Both Garmin and Google analyze your running dynamics (or form) after a run. Each watch measured the exact same stride length for my 13- and 19-mile runs, while my cadence was either the same or 1 step per minute off.</p><p>For other stats like ground contact time and vertical ratio/oscillation, they diverge slightly, with Garmin suggesting my form is more efficient. When I wore three watches, COROS's GCT and stride ratio numbers were closer to Garmin's, so signs suggest Google's running form numbers might be slightly conservative.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-where-the-pixel-watch-4-matches-or-falls-short-of-a-garmin-watch-for-athletes"><span>Where the Pixel Watch 4 matches, or falls short of, a Garmin watch for athletes</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MUmBaF6LrT2yxud3vMtPe6" name="fitbit-new-app-design" alt="The new Fitbit app for Android with redesgined home screen layout" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MUmBaF6LrT2yxud3vMtPe6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google/Fitbit and Garmin have a long list of similar fitness, health, and safety features.

However, one often overlooked category is hybrid smartwatches, which blend a traditional mechanical watch with smart features.</p><p>These "smart" watches may seem boring and not very smart at all, but there's actually a lot more to them than meets the eye. Inside their often small displays is a host of features for owners to utilize while keeping things minimal. It's part of what makes these watches so versatile, and among the reasons why you should consider a hybrid smartwatch as your next wearable buy.</p><h2 id="form-over-function-2">Form over function</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8mwc4eXw8WkS7G8gVJDXoe" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8mwc4eXw8WkS7G8gVJDXoe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One complaint many have about smartwatches is that they <em>look </em>like smartwatches. Unlike the Apple Watch, which is the farthest from a traditional watch by design, Android smartwatches often try to emulate the traditional watch style, with varying degrees of success.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-early-impressions">Pixel Watch</a> is unapologetically a smartwatch, thanks to its bulbous design and domed display, particularly on the latest model. Then there's the Galaxy Watch, which recently updated its design, but still retains a very "smartwatch" design. The closest we've gotten to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> that resemble traditional watches are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> and the Fossil watches of yore, both of which emulate the look and feel of a watch while retaining a rotating crown.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AjASiMALJuaqzT8eUv3XAQ" name="smartwatch-beauty-pageant-all-candidates" alt="A side view of thirteen smartwatches sitting side-by-side on a desk. In order, they are the OnePlus Watch 2R, Withings ScanWatch 2, Google Pixel Watch 3, Apple Watch Ultra 2, Fitbit Sense, Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, Fitbit Charge 6, Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, Garmin Fenix 8, Coros Pace Pro, Amazfit Cheetah Pro, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, and Garmin Instinct 2X Solar." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AjASiMALJuaqzT8eUv3XAQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-hybrid-smartwatches">hybrid smartwatches</a>, for the most part, you're getting a classic watch, complete with a crown (usually) and physical watch hands. If it weren't for the display found in some shape or form on a hybrid watch, you likely wouldn't know there was anything "smart" about it.</p><p>For some, this is a benefit. When I go out and want to look particularly nice, I normally leave my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> or Galaxy Watch at home, and instead reach for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-2-review">Withings ScanWatch 2</a>. This is one of the best-looking "smart" watches I've used, and my opinion was validated during a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a> held by Android Central's Michael Hicks. Out of 13 smartwatches, the ScanWatch 2 won the most votes, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> came in second place.</p><p>Meanwhile, the more mainstream <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> came in second to last place, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> was in 8th place. The results suggest that, to the everyday person, the classic watch style is the best design option.</p><h2 id="keep-it-simple-2">Keep it simple</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GpkUFxtS3gxXouBCobMWFj" name="Garmin-vivomove-trend-notifications.jpeg" alt="The notifications screen on the Garmin vÃ­voactive Trend" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GpkUFxtS3gxXouBCobMWFj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from a classic design that almost anyone can get into, one of the best aspects of a hybrid smartwatch is its simplicity. Compared to the large, vibrant touch screens on a regular smartwatch, a hybrid smartwatch normally has a smaller display with minimal navigation. There are no apps to download, no watch faces to customize; you just have a set of features and settings that you can turn on or off.</p><p>Even a hybrid watch like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivomove-trend-review">Garmin Vivomove Trend</a> has a full touch screen, but it only provides very basic menus while giving you more room to read messages and notifications.</p><p>Some may prefer this minimalism, as it offers much less distraction compared to smartwatches, which always seem to invite you to look at them. After all, if the point of a smartwatch is that you're glancing at your phone less, then that becomes moot if you're constantly looking at your watch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nv6FVK3he4rcEynmWwzKRm" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-3" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 next to a phone with the Withings app open to a workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nv6FVK3he4rcEynmWwzKRm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4021" height="2262" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A hybrid smartwatch will still get things done in the background. They can measure health metrics such as heart rate, blood oxygen, and even ECG on some models. Think of it as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> with a watch face that still gathers important data and pings you for notifications you might want to pay attention to. The minimal displays are best used for glanceable information, forcing you to decide whether something is worth grabbing your phone for or if it can wait.</p><p>You can still track workouts on something like the ScanWatch 2 or Garmin Instinc Crossover, but the menus are often simplified and options are fairly limited, so you're not spending all your time navigating.</p><p>Basically, a hybrid smartwatch isn't begging for your attention; it's for anyone looking for a more passive health tracking experience. Otherwise, it'll function as a pretty normal watch.</p><h2 id="battery-life-for-days-or-weeks-2">Battery life for days (or weeks)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DCqBBueQe9EtWcG7at75cm" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-5" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 next to a phone with the Withings app open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DCqBBueQe9EtWcG7at75cm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4062" height="2285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Because there's no big, battery-sucking touch screen to deal with, some hybrid smartwatches will usually have better battery life than the average smartwatch. Take the ScanWatch 2; on average, it can last just over a month before you need to find your charger.

It's kind of dead weight if it's constantly dead.</p><h2 id="just-one-problem-2">Just one problem</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3580px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="y5jrdeXpHBE5yYqXgHmX8Q" name="Fossil-Gen-6-Hybrid-Wellness-Edition-review-indoors.jpg" alt="The Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness Edition lying on a flat surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y5jrdeXpHBE5yYqXgHmX8Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3580" height="2014" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, when it comes to hybrid smartwatches, the selection is pretty small. Fossil had a pretty solid selection, but when it bowed out of the smartwatch market, it took all its brands with it, including Skagen. That left a huge gap in the hybrid smartwatch market (not to mention the Wear OS market), which is mostly filled by Withings and its various ScanWatch models.</p><p>There's also the Garmin Vivomove Trend or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-instinct-crossover-amoled-hybrid-watch-announced">Instinct Crossover</a> series, but it really depends on the style you're going for. Otherwise, your best bet for a hybrid smartwatch is the Withings ScanWatch 2, which just got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/scanwatch-2/42blue/shop">2025 refresh</a> earlier this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A monster? That's quite the striking image, isnât it? Is it hyperbole, the worried cry of a parent, or another politician saying what she thinks people want to hear?</p><p>Or does it tap into the deep uneasiness we sometimes feel about the ever-present digital world?</p><h2 id="a-digital-double-edged-sword-2">A digital double edged sword</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zconmqpQsbBS57iGHPwdZG" name="tiktok-on-fire-tv.jpg" alt="Tiktok On Fire Tv" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zconmqpQsbBS57iGHPwdZG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Keegan Prosser / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gone are the days of making mud pies or whatever else kids used to do. They're not coming back, either.</p><p>Since the smartphone revolution in the mid-00s, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/facebook-was-most-downloaded-app-decade">Facebook</a>, YouTube, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/instagram-extends-its-ban-self-harm-depiction-fictional-posts">Instagram</a>, Snapchat, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tiktok-registers-2-billion-global-downloads-according-latest-data?region-switch=GB">TikTok</a> â a cascade of platforms have migrated from desktops to pockets. Suddenly, social connection is immediate and inescapable. The age of entry has also plummeted. Despite age restrictions, kids routinely navigate these digital waters, often unsupervised.</p><p>Social media does offer an opportunity for connection. For children geographically isolated or those seeking kinship around niche interests or identities, online platforms can be a lifesaver. The internet fosters creative expression, allowing kids to become filmmakers, artists, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-storybook-gem-is-proof-google-can-make-ai-good">storytellers</a>. It provides access to information, facilitating learning and even civic engagement. It allows people to stand up for causes they believe in and organize social movements. It's not all bad. Not at all.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1782px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="8hKnftaf2q4mLTBPbQBabS" name="Gemini-Storybook-Gem" alt="A Children's Storybook made with Google Gemini." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8hKnftaf2q4mLTBPbQBabS.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1782" height="1002" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A children's storybook made with Google Gemini. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But with everything good, bad can ride along. Some say we're seeing a rise in anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, fueled by trying to create the perfect online life. Experts <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://renucounselling.ca/tiktok-brain/">express concerns</a> about the impact of constant stimulation on developing brains, particularly impulse control and emotional regulation.</p><p>The internet's anonymity fosters cyberbullying and harassment. Late-night scrolling can rob children (and adults) of sleep, leaving them tired and emotionally vulnerable. And perhaps most worrying, an over-reliance on digital interaction can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newyorkbehavioralhealth.com/the-impact-of-social-media-use-on-social-skills/">stunt the development of crucial real-life social skills</a>.</p><p>Then there is the question of exposure to harmful content and the addictive nature of algorithmically curated content. Another recent report <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/03/tech/tiktok-pushed-sexually-explicit-search-terms-to-13-year-olds-report">says TikTok is steering 13-year-olds towards porn</a>, for example.

The Pixel Watch 1 launched in October 2022 with Wear OS 3.5 and is currently running the April 2025 Wear OS 5.1 update.</p><p>Google initially told us it had no comment about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch 1</a>, but a Google spokesperson sent us a statement on Friday that clarified its update strategy:</p><div><blockquote><p>Weâre committed to providing a great experience across the entire Pixel Watch portfolio to make your devices get better over time, which includes three years of essential support to deliver new features, enhancements, and security updates. Pixel Watch 1 did not get Wear OS 6 with the October update and will continue to run on Wear OS 5.1. Please be on the lookout for any future security and bug fixes for Pixel Watch 1.</p></blockquote></div><p>The quote included a link to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/12799779?hl=en">official Pixel Watch update page</a>, which confirms the October 2025 deadline for Pixel Watch 1 updates.</p><p>While the spokesperson didn't definitively say, "No," the statement suggests there won't be a second October update for the Watch 1 with Wear OS 6, and that any updates after October will be limited to security patches.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-downloading-update-forced.jpg" alt="Downloading an update on the Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We had reason to hope that the first Pixel Watch would receive a third major update. Samsung promises four years of software updates, and it has apparently confirmed plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/surprise-one-ui-8-watch-update-is-reviving-this-legacy-galaxy-watch">bring One UI 8 Watch to the Galaxy Watch 4</a> in late 2025, which will be its fourth major update.</p><p>Instead, it appears that Pixel Watches will stick to two version updates and three years of security updates, with occasional security patches after the three-year window.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 1 uses an outdated Exynos 9110 chip originally used in Tizen OS Galaxy Watches. Perhaps Google didn't think Wear OS 6 could run smoothly on older hardware, even with 2GB of RAM. But when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-5">Pixel Watch 5</a> launches next year, the Watch 2 may not receive Wear OS 7 even though it shares the Watch 3's Snapdragon hardware.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-6-is-one-of-the-best-parts-of-the-pixel-watch-4">Wear OS 6 has impressed us</a> so far with its stylish scrolling animations, revamped Tiles, dynamic color theming, custom watch faces, and other functional fixes. It's arguably the best smartwatch update Google has released, which makes it a shame that Pixel Watch 1 owners may never see it.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-early-impressions">Pixel Watch 4</a> launched on October 9 with Wear OS 6; based on Google's update strategy, it seems we can expect it to receive Wear OS 8 in 2027, but not Wear OS 9 in 2028.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>It's obvious that phone brands are turning to AI; with year-on-year upgrades slowing down considerably, manufacturers are looking for anything that can give their devices an edge, and this is where AI comes in. These days, most phone launches (at least on the Android side) are filled with how AI is going to overhaul how you use your phone.</p><p>The reality isn't quite so grand, but brands like Google and Samsung are doing a great job integrating AI-assisted features in a meaningful way on their phones. So if you got a recent phone and haven't looked into all the AI utilities yet, this post should be a good starting point.</p><p>I'm going to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> to showcase AI features on Android. While most brands have a suite of AI offerings, Samsung does the best job both with the number of features available, and how they're organized. In short, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> makes it extremely easy to see which features are actually available on your phone, and how to use them.</p><p>Google also has a strong suite of AI features, but trying to find out what's available on a device like the Pixel 10 Pro XL is like a hidden objects game â you have to constantly dig through the interface to uncover features, and if you're lucky, you'll find a few you'll end up using. Thankfully, Samsung doesn't make things anywhere as convoluted, and given that it is the biggest Android brand by a lot, its features get the most mainstream usage. With that out of the way, let's dive in.</p><h2 id="search-anything-with-google-2">Search anything with Google</h2><p>Google's Circle to Search is highly useful as it lets you search what's on your screen. It's extremely easy too; all you have to do is hold down on the navigation bar, and circle around the object you want to search. The idea is to make it easier to search; if you're scrolling through Instagram and see an interesting pair of shoes (it's basically my entire feed now), you can just draw around the object and search on Google with minimum effort. Here's how to do it:</p><ol start="1"><li>Navigate to <strong>whatever you want to search</strong>.</li><li><strong>Press down</strong> on the navigation bar (the horizontal bar at the bottom of your screen).</li><li>Draw around the <strong>object of interest</strong>.</li><li>Google automatically surfaces details.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4380px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.53%;"><img id="foNgfqpV8Xrd86krKrrXNi" name="Circle to Search" alt="Circle to Search on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/foNgfqpV8Xrd86krKrrXNi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4380" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a nifty utility, and it's there when you want it and hidden away if you don't ever intend to use it.</p><h2 id="translate-anything-with-ease-in-real-time-2">Translate anything with ease â in real-time</h2><p>Another good use of AI is real-time translation. Samsung phones have a few ways where they leverage translation features. The one that I think is the best is Interpreter, as the name suggests, it offers real-time translation, so if you're traveling abroad or don't know the local language, you can use this to get around with ease. Using it as easy as it gets:</p><ol start="1"><li>Pull down the <strong>notification shade</strong>.</li><li>In the quick settings tiles, select <strong>Interpreter</strong>.</li><li><strong>Choose the language</strong> (you can select from over 30 languages) you want to translate, and just hit the record button.</li><li>You'll see a <strong>real-time translation</strong> into the target language you've selected, and it automatically narrates as well.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4380px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.53%;"><img id="7hhqvurpqyjxHoxnQDTP7n" name="Interpreter" alt="Interpreter in Galaxy AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7hhqvurpqyjxHoxnQDTP7n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4380" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="edit-your-photos-the-way-you-want-2">Edit your photos the way you want</h2><p>My biggest AI-related use case is image editing. Whether it's taking out unwanted objects from the background of photos or tweaking colors, you get plenty of useful features around this area.</p><ol start="1"><li>Go to the Gallery.</li><li>Choose the image you want to edit.</li><li>Choose the AI icon (the one with the stars at the bottom of the page).</li><li>You'll see the Generative edit window, and here you can draw objects you want to erase.</li><li>Hit the Generate button. This will erase the objects you've selected and fill in the image.</li><li>Hit Save to preserve the new image.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4380px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.53%;"><img id="5mWXXRN7zRuvhcShVCZTV4" name="Galaxy AI Generative Edit" alt="Generative Edit in Galaxy AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5mWXXRN7zRuvhcShVCZTV4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4380" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another cool feature in Samsung phones is Sketch to image. As the name indicates, you can basically doodle on an image, and it will fill in that object and integrate it into the existing image, making it look natural.</p><ol start="1"><li>Choose an image and select the <strong>AI icon</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Sketch to image</strong>.</li><li><strong>Doodle whatever you want</strong> to add in the image and hit <strong>Generate</strong>.</li><li>You'll see the results of the AI-generated creation. If you like what you see, you can hit Save.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4380px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.53%;"><img id="kMhfgrpvu7RgnJpdCLxtn7" name="Galaxy AI" alt="Sketch to image in Galaxy AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kMhfgrpvu7RgnJpdCLxtn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4380" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="unsure-of-what-to-write-let-ai-do-it-2">Unsure of what to write? Let AI do it</h2><p>AI-assisted writing tools make it easier to churn out an email or polish writing, and Samsung phones do a good job in this area. Like other AI-related tools highlighted until now, this is pretty straightforward to use:</p><ol start="1"><li>Select any text you <strong>want to polish</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>AI icon</strong> to pull up Writing Assist.</li><li>You can choose from the options listed. You get to <strong>clean up the grammar</strong>, use <strong>Writing style </strong>to change the tone of the text, or use <strong>Summarize </strong>to deliver a summary.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4380px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.53%;"><img id="8N5XMwsJMzS8BkcubKrFBD" name="Galaxy AI Writing Assist" alt="Galaxy AI Writing Assist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8N5XMwsJMzS8BkcubKrFBD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4380" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="gemini-is-now-live-2">Gemini is now Live</h2><p>Gemini Live is another feature that's available on most new Android phones. It's basically akin to using Gemini, but with a conversational assistant. So instead of writing down a query and getting a wall of information, the idea is to have a conversation. You also get the ability to share what's around you â by sharing the camera â so if you're out at a landmark, you can just ask Gemini additional details just by pointing your phone at it.</p><p>There isn't much to using the feature; you'll just need to select the Live icon (three vertical lines with a star above the right-most line) at the bottom of the Gemini app. Doing so triggers Gemini Live, and you can get started with the digital assistant.</p><p>That's just a brief overview of what's possible on your Galaxy phone. Most of these features are available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, but I find Samsung's offerings to be the easiest to use.</p><p>While AI is gaining momentum, it isn't at the point where it's overt; if you're like me and don't want to use any of these features, you don't need to â you can even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-deactivate-ai-on-your-android-phone">deactivate AI features on your phone</a> with relative ease. But if you're eager to try what's possible with AI-assisted utilities, this is the best time to get started.</p>]]>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's obvious that phone brands are turning to AI; with year-on-year upgrades slowing down considerably, manufacturers are looking for anything that can give their devices an edge, and this is where AI comes in. These days, most phone launches (at least on the Android side) are filled with how AI is going to overhaul how you use your phone.</p><p>The reality isn't quite so grand, but brands like Google and Samsung are doing a great job integrating AI-assisted features in a meaningful way on their phones. So if you got a recent phone and haven't looked into all the AI utilities yet, this post should be a good starting point.</p><p>I'm going to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> to showcase AI features on Android. While most brands have a suite of AI offerings, Samsung does the best job both with the number of features available, and how they're organized. In short, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> makes it extremely easy to see which features are actually available on your phone, and how to use them.</p><p>Google also has a strong suite of AI features, but trying to find out what's available on a device like the Pixel 10 Pro XL is like a hidden objects game â you have to constantly dig through the interface to uncover features, and if you're lucky, you'll find a few you'll end up using. Thankfully, Samsung doesn't make things anywhere as convoluted, and given that it is the biggest Android brand by a lot, its features get the most mainstream usage. With that out of the way, let's dive in.</p><h2 id="search-anything-with-google-2">Search anything with Google</h2><p>Google's Circle to Search is highly useful as it lets you search what's on your screen. It's extremely easy too; all you have to do is hold down on the navigation bar, and circle around the object you want to search. The idea is to make it easier to search; if you're scrolling through Instagram and see an interesting pair of shoes (it's basically my entire feed now), you can just draw around the object and search on Google with minimum effort.

      <![CDATA[<p>Curious why we're talking about Samsung's next Galaxy Unpacked so early, when they usually launch their flagship phones in January? Well, there have been a ton of Galaxy S26 leaks lately, and we thought you'd want all of it in one spot! From how to watch to what we're expecting, we've got you covered right here.</p><p>This year, we expect to see a possible shuffle in the Galaxy S26 lineup with rumors about Samsung<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-switch-things-up-with-its-galaxy-s26-lineup"> giving up the S26 Plus variant</a> for a more premium Edge model. Other than that, we expect to see some software upgrades, possibly the Galaxy Buds 4, and of course, we're hoping to see Samsung's most hyped tri-fold device, which could launch soon in select countries.</p><h2 id="how-to-watch-the-2026-galaxy-unpacked-2">How to watch the 2026 Galaxy Unpacked</h2><p>This one seems simple and most predictable. While a lucky few journalists and influencers get to attend Samsung's Unpacked events in person, the rest of us have to make do with a live stream of the launch on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_3571213889837284912&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">official website</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung" target="_blank">YouTube platforms</a>. Samsung will likely release its live stream link in the days leading up to the event, and you can click the "notify me" button to receive a heads-up before the live stream begins.</p><p>While it's too early for us to know exactly when and where the event will take place, if Samsung sticks to its usual schedule, it'll probably be in the second or third week of January. The "where" is still a secret!</p><p>So, what can we expect from the Galaxy Unpacked event, and will Samsung's new offerings level up this year? Let's "Unpack" it for you.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-plus-ultra-and-edge-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro, Plus, Ultra, and Edge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-lineup" alt="CAD renders of the Galaxy S26 lineup including the Ultra and Pro models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung could be switching things up with its next flagship lineup, as several leaks have indicated so far. For what it's worth, it won't see a drastic shift, as it will allegedly hold onto its basic trio â the Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. We've heard chatter that Samsung could potentially rebrand the base model as the Galaxy S26 Pro.</p><p>There are also rumors of a fourth phone joining the party this year. The Galaxy S26 Edge was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-could-drop-its-plus-variant-for-the-edge-shaking-up-the-galaxy-s26-lineup">thought to replace the Plus</a>, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">recent rumors</a> suggest Samsung is now considering adding both phones to the lineup.</p><p>As for the trio's design, Samsung doesn't seem to be making drastic changes to it, at least according to the latest leaks.

This could be what makes the Galaxy S26 series' big product stand out from everything else out there right now.  We first saw mentions of this feature back in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/articles/galaxy-s26-ultra-could-shield-101906989.html">September</a>; however,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-shows-first-look-at-built-in-privacy-display"> just a few days ago, another tipster</a> posted screenshots showing the toggle option for this "privacy display."</p><p>As the name suggests, this feature could limit how much of your screen is visible to those standing next to you, especially when you're in a crowded area and entering your banking details on your device.</p><p>That said, this feature is said to be embedded within the workings of the new flagship.  It will automatically turn on when you're using sensitive apps â like banking, messaging, or payment services â or when the phone detects youâre in a crowded place. It will apparently use what Samsung calls "Flex Magic Pixel technology," which tweaks how pixels behave in real-time, probably with AI, to make screen content super hard to read unless you are the owner of the device.</p><p>There also seems to be multiple levels of privacy, including a âMaximum Privacyâ mode that heavily dims the screen for stronger protection, and manual settings for people who prefer full control.</p><h2 id="galaxy-buds-4-2">Galaxy Buds 4</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Buds 4 Pro Software testing has started â¼ï¸Build test :R640XXU0AYI1/R640XXU0AYI1 pic.twitter.com/lvSL008Srd<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1969164703273287826">September 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>As for the next-gen Galaxy Buds, we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/amid-one-ui-8-5-leaks-alleged-galaxy-buds-4-pro-testing-begins-rumor">have a few leaks so far</a> that hint at their existence. Last month, a leak suggested that the Korean OEM has started naming its next buds, the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, using what appear to be internal code names. The test server build supposedly holds clues in its code about the alleged earbuds, with hints to base and Pro model numbers SM-R540 and SM-R640, respectively.</p><p>Since they were found in the strings in Samsung's test server code, there's not enough information about them, so nothing on specs or features as yet. But we do know that they exist and are in the works. In another leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Alfaturk16/status/1969164703273287826" target="_blank">tipster Alfaturk on X</a>, it claims the company has also started developing the firmware for these alleged Buds 4 and 4 Pro models.

The recent one shows the device sporting a U-shaped fold, all but confirming that Samsungâs Trifold features a central cover display flanked by two panels that fold around it. The animation also shows another interesting detail about the alleged cameras on the device, which lets you shoot selfies with the main rear cameras.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1595px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="unfolded form of the Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1595" height="897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @TechHighest / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, it could feature a "newly developed display and film." Other alleged specifications are that the device's main internal display will be around 9.96 inches, and the external display will be 6.49 inches, which is slightly larger than the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally" target="_blank">Huawei</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally"> Mate XT.</a></p><p>In terms of design, it is said to sport a titanium frame, 16GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon chipset, and without a doubt, it will come with a hefty price tag.</p><p>More recently, a "person familiar with the company's plans" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-trifold-may-debut-in-the-us-amid-rumors-of-a-simultaneous-launch-event">told CNN that the U.S.</a> has been a part of their launch discussions. Samsung was rumored to launch its Trifold phone first only in South Korea, before expanding it across other regions based on how the phone fares in the domestic market. However, it might be switching things up with the Trifold by launching it simultaneously in both its home market and the U.S., rather than staggering the release.</p><p>However, it's unclear if a U.S. launch will happen at the same time, if at all. A staggered release could happen, which means we'd have to wait a bit longer to see the Trifold stateside, possibly during the Galaxy S26 launch. It's conjecture at this point, but either way, we'll be keeping an eye on this one.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Curious why we're talking about Samsung's next Galaxy Unpacked so early, when they usually launch their flagship phones in January? Well, there have been a ton of Galaxy S26 leaks lately, and we thought you'd want all of it in one spot! From how to watch to what we're expecting, we've got you covered right here.</p><p>This year, we expect to see a possible shuffle in the Galaxy S26 lineup with rumors about Samsung<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-switch-things-up-with-its-galaxy-s26-lineup"> giving up the S26 Plus variant</a> for a more premium Edge model. Other than that, we expect to see some software upgrades, possibly the Galaxy Buds 4, and of course, we're hoping to see Samsung's most hyped tri-fold device, which could launch soon in select countries.</p><h2 id="how-to-watch-the-2026-galaxy-unpacked-2">How to watch the 2026 Galaxy Unpacked</h2><p>This one seems simple and most predictable. While a lucky few journalists and influencers get to attend Samsung's Unpacked events in person, the rest of us have to make do with a live stream of the launch on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_3571213889837284912&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">official website</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung" target="_blank">YouTube platforms</a>. Samsung will likely release its live stream link in the days leading up to the event, and you can click the "notify me" button to receive a heads-up before the live stream begins.</p><p>While it's too early for us to know exactly when and where the event will take place, if Samsung sticks to its usual schedule, it'll probably be in the second or third week of January. The "where" is still a secret!</p><p>So, what can we expect from the Galaxy Unpacked event, and will Samsung's new offerings level up this year? Let's "Unpack" it for you.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-plus-ultra-and-edge-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro, Plus, Ultra, and Edge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-lineup" alt="CAD renders of the Galaxy S26 lineup including the Ultra and Pro models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung could be switching things up with its next flagship lineup, as several leaks have indicated so far. For what it's worth, it won't see a drastic shift, as it will allegedly hold onto its basic trio â the Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. We've heard chatter that Samsung could potentially rebrand the base model as the Galaxy S26 Pro.</p><p>There are also rumors of a fourth phone joining the party this year.

Samsung was rumored to launch its Trifold phone first only in South Korea, before expanding it across other regions based on how the phone fares in the domestic market. However, it might be switching things up with the Trifold by launching it simultaneously in both its home market and the U.S., rather than staggering the release.</p><p>However, it's unclear if a U.S. launch will happen at the same time, if at all. A staggered release could happen, which means we'd have to wait a bit longer to see the Trifold stateside, possibly during the Galaxy S26 launch. It's conjecture at this point, but either way, we'll be keeping an eye on this one.</p>]]>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Curious why we're talking about Samsung's next Galaxy Unpacked so early, when they usually launch their flagship phones in January? Well, there have been a ton of Galaxy S26 leaks lately, and we thought you'd want all of it in one spot! From how to watch to what we're expecting, we've got you covered right here.</p><p>This year, we expect to see a possible shuffle in the Galaxy S26 lineup with rumors about Samsung<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-switch-things-up-with-its-galaxy-s26-lineup"> giving up the S26 Plus variant</a> for a more premium Edge model. Other than that, we expect to see some software upgrades, possibly the Galaxy Buds 4, and of course, we're hoping to see Samsung's most hyped tri-fold device, which could launch soon in select countries.</p><h2 id="how-to-watch-the-2026-galaxy-unpacked-2">How to watch the 2026 Galaxy Unpacked</h2><p>This one seems simple and most predictable. While a lucky few journalists and influencers get to attend Samsung's Unpacked events in person, the rest of us have to make do with a live stream of the launch on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_3571213889837284912&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">official website</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung" target="_blank">YouTube platforms</a>. Samsung will likely release its live stream link in the days leading up to the event, and you can click the "notify me" button to receive a heads-up before the live stream begins.</p><p>While it's too early for us to know exactly when and where the event will take place, if Samsung sticks to its usual schedule, it'll probably be in the second or third week of January. The "where" is still a secret!</p><p>So, what can we expect from the Galaxy Unpacked event, and will Samsung's new offerings level up this year? Let's "Unpack" it for you.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-plus-ultra-and-edge-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro, Plus, Ultra, and Edge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-lineup" alt="CAD renders of the Galaxy S26 lineup including the Ultra and Pro models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung could be switching things up with its next flagship lineup, as several leaks have indicated so far. For what it's worth, it won't see a drastic shift, as it will allegedly hold onto its basic trio â the Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. We've heard chatter that Samsung could potentially rebrand the base model as the Galaxy S26 Pro.</p><p>There are also rumors of a fourth phone joining the party this year. The Galaxy S26 Edge was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-could-drop-its-plus-variant-for-the-edge-shaking-up-the-galaxy-s26-lineup">thought to replace the Plus</a>, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">recent rumors</a> suggest Samsung is now considering adding both phones to the lineup.</p><p>As for the trio's design, Samsung doesn't seem to be making drastic changes to it, at least according to the latest leaks. The devices appear to resemble their predecessors; however, they might feature a thinner profile, similar to the recent Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.  If the Korean OEM is chasing thinness, it could end up using thinner camera modules that are integrated with the rear panel, making the frame sleeker. CAD-based renders of Samsungâs upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> lineup back the fact that the Pro and Ultra models won't look different.</p><p>However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-and-s26-pro-could-get-a-subtle-but-noticeable-reshuffle" target="_blank">Galaxy S26 Edge</a> could show up with its rear panel dominated by a camera island that spans nearly the phoneâs entire width, much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/apple" target="_blank">Apple</a>âs iPhone 17 Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.93%;"><img id="unZnRYwhUK29vb85wttHVZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-4" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/unZnRYwhUK29vb85wttHVZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1938" height="1084" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of cameras, the Galaxy S26 Pro would retain its predecessor's camera array. On the other hand, the Galaxy S26 Ultra might get a fresh set of lenses. Leaks suggest that there could be a larger 200MP Sony main sensor, while others suggest minimal hardware changes for the quad-camera setup with a new 200MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 10MP 3x telephoto, and 50MP 5x periscope lens.</p><p>Rumors also indicate that the new<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5"> Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 </a>chip could power phones in some regions, while others could get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-might-rock-the-exynos-2600-chip-but-only-in-this-region">Exynos 2600 processor</a>. All models are rumored to feature a base of at least 12GB of RAM, with a possible jump to 16GB as an option. The series will launch with Android 16 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-already-chasing-one-ui-8-5-new-leak-spots-galaxy-s25-test">Samsung's One UI 8.5.</a></p><p>As for the battery, the base version could feature a 4,300mAh battery, the Edge variant might have a larger 4,200mAh battery, and the Ultra is expected to get a massive 5,500mAh battery. S Pen fans can also breathe a sigh of relief as the phone will likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-s-pen-isnt-going-away-at-least-on-the-galaxy-s26-ultra">keep the S Pen</a>, adopt a slimmer build, and support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">faster 60W charging</a>.</p><p>But it's important to note that these are still preliminary leaks, and all these features may not make it on the actual device.

We'll probably see more as we get closer to the launch, allegedly in January.</p><h2 id="galaxy-g-fold-tri-fold-2">Galaxy G Fold (Tri-fold)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yJF6kbcTg82QcDvhLffvCi" name="Samsung Foldable OLED" alt="Samsung Foldable OLED demo panels at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yJF6kbcTg82QcDvhLffvCi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has repeatedly dropped hints that it is working on a tri-fold device. Be it during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">January Unpacked</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC</a> this year. A Korean news website reported earlier this year that Samsung Electronics was working on launching the "Galaxy G Fold" and the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but that didn't happen.</p><p>We haven't seen official renders or even leaks of the Galaxy Z TriFold; however, animation videos have been popping up quite a bit. The recent one shows the device sporting a U-shaped fold, all but confirming that Samsungâs Trifold features a central cover display flanked by two panels that fold around it. The animation also shows another interesting detail about the alleged cameras on the device, which lets you shoot selfies with the main rear cameras.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1595px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="unfolded form of the Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1595" height="897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @TechHighest / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, it could feature a "newly developed display and film." Other alleged specifications are that the device's main internal display will be around 9.96 inches, and the external display will be 6.49 inches, which is slightly larger than the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally" target="_blank">Huawei</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally"> Mate XT.</a></p><p>In terms of design, it is said to sport a titanium frame, 16GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon chipset, and without a doubt, it will come with a hefty price tag.</p><p>More recently, a "person familiar with the company's plans" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-trifold-may-debut-in-the-us-amid-rumors-of-a-simultaneous-launch-event">told CNN that the U.S.</a> has been a part of their launch discussions. Samsung was rumored to launch its Trifold phone first only in South Korea, before expanding it across other regions based on how the phone fares in the domestic market. However, it might be switching things up with the Trifold by launching it simultaneously in both its home market and the U.S., rather than staggering the release.</p><p>However, it's unclear if a U.S. launch will happen at the same time, if at all. A staggered release could happen, which means we'd have to wait a bit longer to see the Trifold stateside, possibly during the Galaxy S26 launch. It's conjecture at this point, but either way, we'll be keeping an eye on this one.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to several images posted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-xr" target="_blank">website</a>, the alleged VR headset will have six cameras on the front and two lenses internally.</p><p>Several sensors will be fitted around the front of the device to make sure the device detects gestures and eye movements. Additionally, the leak claims that the headset will have microphones and speakers, advanced enough to detect the difference between the user's speech and someone speaking to them.</p><p>The leak claims that this headset will run on "One UI XR," which sounds like a skin of Android XR.

Now, I haven't tried shooting jets of hot water at any of these phones with IP69 ingress protection, so I'll have Vivo's word that the phone withstands pressurized jets up to 80 degrees.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5172px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="eVWPomyqUpYpfyEi6bqNfQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eVWPomyqUpYpfyEi6bqNfQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5172" height="2913" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only issue I have with the design is the camera island at the back; the oblong design meshes well with the overall aesthetic, but the island protrudes from the body, and makes the X200 FE wobble quite a bit when using it on a table. Of course, it isn't anywhere as extreme as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but this just wasn't an issue on the X200 or X200 Pro because of the massive camera modules on those devices. Vivo should have retained a similar design at least, albeit a smidgen smaller.</p><h2 id="the-hardware-you-need-2">The hardware you need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4961px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="BCnVJQbaqoYakeEwUnKStQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCnVJQbaqoYakeEwUnKStQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4961" height="2794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo knows what it's doing with the hardware, and there isn't much to talk about in this area. The 6.31-inch AMOLED panel has good color vibrancy and contrast levels, and you get the same level of customization as the other X200 devices. It has the Shield Glass that Vivo has been using for a while instead of Corning's Gorilla Glass solution, and it has proven to be reliable in my usage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pdVp3qFyUusf6B5E7k5VkQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdVp3qFyUusf6B5E7k5VkQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I had the X200 FE for just over two months now, and in that time, the phone took a few tumbles thankfully, it came away unscathed each time.

Thankfully, there's 12GB of RAM as standard, and the 512GB model I'm using comes with 16GB of memory.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4807px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ToZC6RwSbrouPHWRBXvLdQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ToZC6RwSbrouPHWRBXvLdQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4807" height="2708" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The X200 FE gets a 50MP main lens alongside a 50MP 3x tele and 8MP wide-angle, and honestly, it does a fabulous job taking photos.

Vivo somehow managed to slot in a huge 6,500mAh battery in the phone, and it is even bigger than what you get on the X200 Pro. The result is that the X200 FE lasts two days between charges, and even after pushing the phone, I comfortably got a day and a half.</p><p>Battery anxiety is a thing of the past on Android â unless you're using the S25 Edge. Other than that outlier, any phone should last a day with relative ease, and I didn't have to worry about the battery running out before the end of the day on any of the 50 or so devices I tested this year.

Vivo somehow managed to slot in a huge 6,500mAh battery in the phone, and it is even bigger than what you get on the X200 Pro. The result is that the X200 FE lasts two days between charges, and even after pushing the phone, I comfortably got a day and a half.</p><p>Battery anxiety is a thing of the past on Android â unless you're using the S25 Edge. Other than that outlier, any phone should last a day with relative ease, and I didn't have to worry about the battery running out before the end of the day on any of the 50 or so devices I tested this year.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It feels like Vivo can do no wrong in 2025; whether it's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>, or the V60, the brand has managed to consistently deliver fabulous phones. The X200 Ultra continues to deliver the best cameras of any phone I used this year, and the X200 Pro is still my go-to choice when it comes to daily use.</p><p>If anything, Vivo is now my favorite Android brand, and I enjoy using Funtouch OS over other Chinese skins. It's a good thing, then, that Vivo introduced a small phone to take on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a>. The X200 FE comes with a smaller 6.31-inch panel, and it doesn't have much in the way of similarities to the regular X200 or X200 Pro â it has a distinct identity, and it looks great.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WSvvEPhDGfAnAuF6kKQvjQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WSvvEPhDGfAnAuF6kKQvjQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo still doesn't sell its phones outside Southeast Asian markets, and as a result, the X200 FE is limited to select regions. The good news is that it is available in India, where it currently costs â¹54,999 ($620) for the 12GB/256GB model. That's in line with what the OnePlus 13s costs in the country as well, so there isn't much to differentiate either device in that regard.</p><h2 id="clean-design-with-usability-in-mind-2">Clean design with usability in mind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7gnfDKBvVGVoLXFdPLwWkQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7gnfDKBvVGVoLXFdPLwWkQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like the design of the X200 FE.

Vivo should have retained a similar design at least, albeit a smidgen smaller.</p><h2 id="the-hardware-you-need-2">The hardware you need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4961px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="BCnVJQbaqoYakeEwUnKStQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCnVJQbaqoYakeEwUnKStQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4961" height="2794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo knows what it's doing with the hardware, and there isn't much to talk about in this area. The 6.31-inch AMOLED panel has good color vibrancy and contrast levels, and you get the same level of customization as the other X200 devices. It has the Shield Glass that Vivo has been using for a while instead of Corning's Gorilla Glass solution, and it has proven to be reliable in my usage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pdVp3qFyUusf6B5E7k5VkQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdVp3qFyUusf6B5E7k5VkQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I had the X200 FE for just over two months now, and in that time, the phone took a few tumbles thankfully, it came away unscathed each time. The panel gets 2,160Hz PWM dimming along with the usual 120Hz refresh, and it is fluid â just like other Vivo phones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4939px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="wrMC4i8jG8t6Nc7vUJMseQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wrMC4i8jG8t6Nc7vUJMseQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4939" height="2782" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In short, there are no issues with the smaller-sized panel. It may not have the real estate of the X200 Pro, but it's just as good to play games on, and it gets bright in outdoor use. On that note, the Dimensity 9300+ platform powering the phone is a known quantity, and it does a good job handling visually-demanding games. I would have liked the same Dimensity 9400 as the rest of the X200 range, but the older platform still has a lot to offer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7njJ6okK2ceWpkQcAWsdbQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7njJ6okK2ceWpkQcAWsdbQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5105" height="2875" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My main annoyance in this area is that Vivo is using UFS 3.1 storage modules; while I get that the X200 FE doesn't cost as much as its siblings, even mid-range phones are now coming with UFS 4.0, so I don't really understand why the brand didn't use those modules. Thankfully, there's 12GB of RAM as standard, and the 512GB model I'm using comes with 16GB of memory.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4807px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ToZC6RwSbrouPHWRBXvLdQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ToZC6RwSbrouPHWRBXvLdQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4807" height="2708" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The X200 FE gets a 50MP main lens alongside a 50MP 3x tele and 8MP wide-angle, and honestly, it does a fabulous job taking photos. It doesn't measure up to the X200 Pro, but it uses the same main camera as the X200, and while the wide-angle lens isn't quite as good, I didn't have any problems with the other modules.</p><h2 id="it-is-a-battery-beast-2">It is a battery beast</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="NFNHjEfvPKKczHPQsx5BgQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NFNHjEfvPKKczHPQsx5BgQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5134" height="2892" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most small phones don't last as long as traditional flagships, but that is not the case with the X200 FE. Vivo somehow managed to slot in a huge 6,500mAh battery in the phone, and it is even bigger than what you get on the X200 Pro. The result is that the X200 FE lasts two days between charges, and even after pushing the phone, I comfortably got a day and a half.</p><p>Battery anxiety is a thing of the past on Android â unless you're using the S25 Edge. Other than that outlier, any phone should last a day with relative ease, and I didn't have to worry about the battery running out before the end of the day on any of the 50 or so devices I tested this year. If anything, the only device that was problematic in this area is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-air-is-the-coolest-phone-i-used-in-2025">iPhone Air</a>, but that's an entirely different entity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cHtJEu3ZkTHDNuoEzSC8qQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cHtJEu3ZkTHDNuoEzSC8qQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the X200 FE, you don't need to worry about the battery whatsoever. It takes an hour to charge even with the bundled 90W charger, but that's not a problem at all. Just like the other X200 phones, the X200 FE gets a silicon-based battery to achieve a density of 845Wh/L, and it's clear that Vivo and other Chinese brands are using this tech to great effect this year.</p><h2 id="this-is-the-small-phone-you-need-2">This is the small phone you need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5161px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="f3fDTfRRxFfQrRhbwrKLjQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f3fDTfRRxFfQrRhbwrKLjQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5161" height="2907" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you need a small phone that holds its own against regular flagships, I have no problems recommending the X200 FE.

But after Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold put the rest of the market on notice, the same can be said about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, but for a completely different reason.</p><p>We've lamented on numerous occasions about how the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> was an eyesore and behind the 8-ball as soon as it arrived. It was awkward, had thick bezels, and a hinge that may or may not have opened all the way. It made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> look futuristic, despite using a design that was already getting a bit long in the tooth.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="DyuViJDrBfrwwH4rMZLJHW" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold-hinges-2" alt="Google Pixel Fold vs. Pixel 10 Pro Fold hinges" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DyuViJDrBfrwwH4rMZLJHW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google then surprised us all with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-one-year-later">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, managing to beat out the rest in the race to become as thin as possible. Fast forward to now, and Google has "recycled" this design for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, skipping the "thin" factor in favor of other specs, such as a larger battery and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 magnetic charging</a>. However, there's another reason why the added thickness doesn't bother me, and it's one we probably don't think about enough.</p><h2 id="where-the-pixel-10-pro-fold-stands-apart-2">Where the Pixel 10 Pro Fold stands apart</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fSdhd6NaRgHxEMHyKeUSoN" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hinge-schematics-design-hero" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold design schematics lifestyle image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fSdhd6NaRgHxEMHyKeUSoN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="676" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's one thing that Google's flagship foldable has over the rest of the competition: an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-waterproof">IP68 rating</a>. Frankly, many wondered if such a rating would ever apply to foldables, given the numerous fail points on a phone with a built-in hinge. Not to mention that Google was the first to achieve this, not Samsung, Oppo, Xiaomi, or any other phone maker.</p><p>In doing so, it provides me (and hopefully everyone else) with a bit more confidence when I get caught in a thunderstorm or take a trip with the family to the beach.

However, there's another reason why the added thickness doesn't bother me, and it's one we probably don't think about enough.</p><h2 id="where-the-pixel-10-pro-fold-stands-apart-2">Where the Pixel 10 Pro Fold stands apart</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fSdhd6NaRgHxEMHyKeUSoN" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hinge-schematics-design-hero" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold design schematics lifestyle image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fSdhd6NaRgHxEMHyKeUSoN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="676" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's one thing that Google's flagship foldable has over the rest of the competition: an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-waterproof">IP68 rating</a>. Frankly, many wondered if such a rating would ever apply to foldables, given the numerous fail points on a phone with a built-in hinge. Not to mention that Google was the first to achieve this, not Samsung, Oppo, Xiaomi, or any other phone maker.</p><p>In doing so, it provides me (and hopefully everyone else) with a bit more confidence when I get caught in a thunderstorm or take a trip with the family to the beach. No, I'm not saying you should drop the 10 Pro Fold into a bucket of water to test it, but you also won't have to worry quite as much compared to others.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FqjZHrLV5RZGMdaYe8vaDW" name="pixel-10-pro-galaxy-z-fold-7-oppo-find-n5-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 with Oppo Find N5 and Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FqjZHrLV5RZGMdaYe8vaDW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Initially, I didn't really think much about the IP rating, mainly because I'm almost never in a situation that would require me to worry about it. However, funnily enough, that all changed recently when I went to a three-day music festival at the beach.</p><p>Being who I am â a nerd who likes phones and tech â I went to the festival with three different phones. Two were foldables, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> in one front pocket, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a> in the back pocket, and the non-folding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a> in the other front pocket.</p><p>Day one of the concert festival went off without a hitch, but day two was a completely different story</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3Dd8wTxXBUjvGs6XzjpGEP" name="good-charlotte-sum-41-pixel-10-pro-1" alt="Good Charlotte and Sum 41 at concert taken on Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3Dd8wTxXBUjvGs6XzjpGEP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was raining off and on all day, and it got worse after my wife and I arrived. We were there to see a few different bands, but the headliner for night two was Good Charlotte, a band that we both love and haven't had the opportunity to see. The problem was that by the time they came on stage, it felt like we were standing in the outer bands of a hurricane with heavy rain and winds.</p><p>Naturally, when you're someone like me, carrying three phones and seeing bands you listened to religiously growing up, you want to take pictures. Throw in the fact that Good Charlotte had a surprise guest in Deryck Whibley of Sum 41, and it's even more of a reason to record a video or take some pictures.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HKqiVPdfvjMmzaMb7VPxBW" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-pixel-10-pro-galaxy-z-fold-7-oppo-find-n5-1" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold with Galaxy Z Fold 7, Oppo Find N5, and Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HKqiVPdfvjMmzaMb7VPxBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not once did I reach for either the Find N5 or the Z Fold 7 out of fear that the conditions might overwhelm them. Instead, I relied on the Pixel 10 Pro to snap pictures of the band as they played through the hits of my childhood. All the while, jumping around and dancing in a downpour that just so happened to let up as soon as Good Charlotte's time was up.</p><p>That hesitation was enough to make me wish that I had the 10 Pro Fold with me, as I would've felt just as comfortable using that over the other two foldables in my pockets. Not only could I have written about that experience, but I also would've been more likely to leave all of the other phones behind and just carry that one.</p><h2 id="compromises-for-the-sake-of-compromises-2">Compromises for the sake of compromises</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XKsPPcTYiN3ThWNJL3ktFW" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-galaxy-z-fold-7-magic-v5-oppo-find-n5-game-boy" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Honor Magic V5, Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, Oppo Find N5 stacked next to original Game Boy DMG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XKsPPcTYiN3ThWNJL3ktFW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The thing with foldable phones is that they represent the epitome of compromise within the smartphone space. Companies try to cram as much tech as they can into phones that aren't just simple slabs of aluminum and glass, usually to the detriment of one feature or another. It's why the Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn't have the same camera hardware as the 10 Pro XL, despite the former being about $800 less expensive.</p><p>This idea of compromise is also why Samsung ultimately decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-support-the-s-pen">ditch S Pen support</a> with the Fold 7, as the digitizer prevented Samsung from making the phone as thin as it wanted. And while I think there's a prototype out there that looks like the Fold 7 but includes the necessary tech to support the S Pen, I suspect that it'll never see the light of day.</p><p>Honestly, I don't even know if I would care at all about the IP68 rating if it weren't for my concert experience. But if anything, it's made me realize that it's time for Samsung, Motorola, and every other foldable phone maker to get on board. Even if that means that the phone is a few millimeters thicker than the current models.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c0ff7ead-c155-4f70-920a-41130f9bd6f5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHw8obrqbC2rRRZUMSq77i.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold in Jade"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><strong>Don't sleep on it</strong></p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold might not be the thinnest foldable, but Google is relying on other major changes to lead the way, even if they aren't immediately noticeable.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>]]></content:encoded>
