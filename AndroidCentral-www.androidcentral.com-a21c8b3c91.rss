      <![CDATA[<p>Music streaming services are fantastic at doing a lot of things. They're generally affordable, they offer millions of songs a tap away, and they are superb for discovery and socialization. That's why services like Spotify have nearly 700 million monthly active users, and competitors like Apple Music have over 140 million monthly active users.</p><p>The way you interact with these streaming services is usually through a first-party app, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="spotify android central">Spotify</a> or Tidal on the Google Play Store or Music on iOS. There's one small problem with that, though. When streaming services try to cater their app to meet the needs of nearly a billion people, these apps are unlikely to meet the specific needs of <em>you</em>.</p><p>That's why you should consider keeping your preferred music streaming provider, but giving your music player app a facelift. Usually, we think of custom music player apps from Android as being alternatives to streaming. That doesn't have to be the case.</p><p>There are apps that can tap into services like Spotify, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-music-android">Apple Music</a>, Tidal, Deezer, YouTube Music, and many more — all while providing a more custom and thoughtful listening experience. That's in addition to classic options that leverage audio files stored locally on your device. Over the past few months, I've slowly replaced multiple default music streamers with third-party alternatives, and I think they're worth your time.</p><h2 id="poweramp-is-a-fantastic-on-device-music-player-2">Poweramp is a fantastic on-device music player</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="suadQ2MZjfURMZeMpVmjGE" name="Android-Music-Player-Apps-9" alt="Music player apps running on various Android phones and iPhones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/suadQ2MZjfURMZeMpVmjGE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong></strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxmpz.audioplayer&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Download Poweramp on the Google Play Store</strong></a><strong></strong></li></ul><p>Starting simple, Poweramp is an excellent and well-known local music player for Android. It's ideal for people who don't depend on streaming services for music playback. It could come in handy if you have a large physical media collection that you've transitioned to digital, or for those who prefer high-fidelity source material, like FLACs or ALACs.</p><p>In other words, if you already have the files, Poweramp can play them — no streaming service required. There's a free app, but you'll probably want the paid version that costs a few bucks. It's a one-time fee compared to the perpetual charges from a streaming service.</p><p>Poweramp comes with a lot of features that span use cases far beyond what I require. I opened up my wallet for Poweramp because of its customizable user interface and design language, which includes options to overemphasize, deemphasize, or disable Material You colors entirely.

      <![CDATA[<p>Music streaming services are fantastic at doing a lot of things. They're generally affordable, they offer millions of songs a tap away, and they are superb for discovery and socialization. That's why services like Spotify have nearly 700 million monthly active users, and competitors like Apple Music have over 140 million monthly active users.</p><p>The way you interact with these streaming services is usually through a first-party app, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="spotify android central">Spotify</a> or Tidal on the Google Play Store or Music on iOS. There's one small problem with that, though. When streaming services try to cater their app to meet the needs of nearly a billion people, these apps are unlikely to meet the specific needs of <em>you</em>.</p><p>That's why you should consider keeping your preferred music streaming provider, but giving your music player app a facelift. Usually, we think of custom music player apps from Android as being alternatives to streaming. That doesn't have to be the case.</p><p>There are apps that can tap into services like Spotify, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-music-android">Apple Music</a>, Tidal, Deezer, YouTube Music, and many more — all while providing a more custom and thoughtful listening experience. That's in addition to classic options that leverage audio files stored locally on your device. Over the past few months, I've slowly replaced multiple default music streamers with third-party alternatives, and I think they're worth your time.</p><h2 id="poweramp-is-a-fantastic-on-device-music-player-2">Poweramp is a fantastic on-device music player</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="suadQ2MZjfURMZeMpVmjGE" name="Android-Music-Player-Apps-9" alt="Music player apps running on various Android phones and iPhones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/suadQ2MZjfURMZeMpVmjGE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong></strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxmpz.audioplayer&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Download Poweramp on the Google Play Store</strong></a><strong></strong></li></ul><p>Starting simple, Poweramp is an excellent and well-known local music player for Android.

But does that necessarily mean you should just jump at the best deal you can find now?

The Galaxy S25 Ultra remains at the top of its class in performance, largely thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>. This is paired with 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage.</p><p>It's likely to be much of the same story with the Galaxy S26 Ultra, with one obvious change. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> was recently announced at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit, and we expect this to be the chip powering Samsung's 2026 flagship. The only difference is that we also expect it to be slightly tweaked, while sporting the "for Galaxy" branding.</p><p>Here's a look at the expected specs of the Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. the Galaxy S25 Ultra:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB / 16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 1TB UFS 4.0 (or UFS 4.1)</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB / 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>12MP 3x telephoto</p></td><td  ><p>10MP 3x telephoto</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 4</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 5x telephoto</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 5x telephoto</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP wide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6GHz, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, UWB, Bluetooth 6.0</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6GHz, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, UWB, Bluetooth 5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>45W or 60W wired, Qi 2.2 Magnetic Compatibility w/ 25W wireless speeds</p></td><td  ><p>45W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>163.4 x 77.9 x 7.9mm</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>217 grams</p></td><td  ><p>218 grams</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8.5 w/ Android 16 QPR2</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8 w/ Android 16</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>There is another rumored change: the Galaxy S26 Ultra is offered with 16GB of RAM instead of 12GB. Doing so would put it in line with Google's Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, and could provide some "wiggle room" for any future Gemini or Galaxy AI features in the pipeline.</p><p>Another area where we're hoping to see Samsung match up with Google is in charging capabilities. Although the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Z Fold 7 are Qi2 compatible, they aren't equipped with faster wireless charging speeds or built-in magnets. Instead, you still currently need to rely on a case (or adapter) if you want to enjoy magnetic accessories.</p><p>Some rumors suggest this will be rectified with the S26 Ultra, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">it's said to support the Qi 2.2 standard</a>. With that, we could have proper magnetic accessory compatibility, along with faster 25W wireless charging speeds, and potentially even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">60W wired charging</a>. However, it's also worth noting that while many signs point to faster charging, Samsung will likely stick to the 5,000mAh battery size.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-3" alt="Close-up on Galaxy S25 Ultra camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>More changes are likely to come to the Galaxy S26 Ultra's camera system, and not just in the slight differences in the rear camera alignment. On paper, the S26 Ultra may share a similar quad rear-camera setup, with a 200MP main wide-angle lens, a 3x telephoto, 50MP 5x telephoto, and 50MP ultrawide sensors.</p><p>It's likely that Samsung will implement the latest version of its 200MP main lens; there was excitement for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-points-to-a-sweet-camera-upgrade-for-your-close-up-shots">potential upgrade</a> to the 3x telephoto camera.

Not only that, but as a result of cropping to a smaller sensor, this could mean fewer details and light would be captured than what the Galaxy S25 Ultra can produce.</p><p>It's not all disappointing news, however, with rumors pointing to Samsung introducing its own "APV codec."

Especially considering that we'll likely see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-best-prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-big-deal-days-2025">variety of deals</a> for the Galaxy S25 Ultra that make it as cheap, if not cheaper, than the pre-order deals were available.</p><p>Not to mention that we don't know if Samsung is planning on any surprise price hikes, as that seems to be a going trend nowadays. However, even if the Galaxy S26 Ultra is more expensive than the S25 Ultra was at launch, we can't imagine it would be by more than $100. And while that's not an insignificant amount, there likely aren't many groundbreaking upgrades to warrant anything more.</p><p>All of this is to say, if you want the absolute best that Android has to offer, wait a couple more months. If Samsung's past schedule is anything to go by, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should likely arrive sometime in late January or early February. At which point, you'll be able to see all of the cards in the deck, plus, if you'd still prefer the S25 Ultra, it'll probably be even less expensive.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7dd3ce3f-c778-45f1-9592-70dea57b39ee">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7aPuds4bUohAeDeEDRcqi.jpg' alt="samsung galaxy s25 ultra square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The incumbent</strong></em></p><p>If you're looking to upgrade, now might seem to be the best time to grab the Galaxy S25 Ultra.

Although the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Z Fold 7 are Qi2 compatible, they aren't equipped with faster wireless charging speeds or built-in magnets.

With that, we could have proper magnetic accessory compatibility, along with faster 25W wireless charging speeds, and potentially even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">60W wired charging</a>.

This stands for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-advanced-professional-video-codec-is-coming-with-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-do-you-need-this">Advanced Professional Video</a>, and is said to "preserve far better than existing options while keeping storage demands in check." If that sounds kind of familiar, it's not all that dissimilar to what Apple ProRes offers when recording video on the iPhone.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-is-it-worth-waiting-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Is it worth waiting?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CJ3tKHPmEXBczgC7e3A7iW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJ3tKHPmEXBczgC7e3A7iW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are plenty of questions that even the rumors and leaks have yet to answer regarding the Galaxy S26 Ultra, making the decision that much more difficult. Especially considering that we'll likely see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-best-prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-big-deal-days-2025">variety of deals</a> for the Galaxy S25 Ultra that make it as cheap, if not cheaper, than the pre-order deals were available.</p><p>Not to mention that we don't know if Samsung is planning on any surprise price hikes, as that seems to be a going trend nowadays. However, even if the Galaxy S26 Ultra is more expensive than the S25 Ultra was at launch, we can't imagine it would be by more than $100. And while that's not an insignificant amount, there likely aren't many groundbreaking upgrades to warrant anything more.</p><p>All of this is to say, if you want the absolute best that Android has to offer, wait a couple more months. If Samsung's past schedule is anything to go by, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should likely arrive sometime in late January or early February. At which point, you'll be able to see all of the cards in the deck, plus, if you'd still prefer the S25 Ultra, it'll probably be even less expensive.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7dd3ce3f-c778-45f1-9592-70dea57b39ee">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7aPuds4bUohAeDeEDRcqi.jpg' alt="samsung galaxy s25 ultra square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The incumbent</strong></em></p><p>If you're looking to upgrade, now might seem to be the best time to grab the Galaxy S25 Ultra.

Although the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Z Fold 7 are Qi2 compatible, they aren't equipped with faster wireless charging speeds or built-in magnets.

With that, we could have proper magnetic accessory compatibility, along with faster 25W wireless charging speeds, and potentially even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">60W wired charging</a>.

Not only that, but as a result of cropping to a smaller sensor, this could mean fewer details and light would be captured than what the Galaxy S25 Ultra can produce.</p><p>It's not all disappointing news, however, with rumors pointing to Samsung introducing its own "APV codec." This stands for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-advanced-professional-video-codec-is-coming-with-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-do-you-need-this">Advanced Professional Video</a>, and is said to "preserve far better than existing options while keeping storage demands in check." If that sounds kind of familiar, it's not all that dissimilar to what Apple ProRes offers when recording video on the iPhone.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-is-it-worth-waiting-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Is it worth waiting?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CJ3tKHPmEXBczgC7e3A7iW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJ3tKHPmEXBczgC7e3A7iW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are plenty of questions that even the rumors and leaks have yet to answer regarding the Galaxy S26 Ultra, making the decision that much more difficult. Especially considering that we'll likely see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-best-prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-big-deal-days-2025">variety of deals</a> for the Galaxy S25 Ultra that make it as cheap, if not cheaper, than the pre-order deals were available.</p><p>Not to mention that we don't know if Samsung is planning on any surprise price hikes, as that seems to be a going trend nowadays. However, even if the Galaxy S26 Ultra is more expensive than the S25 Ultra was at launch, we can't imagine it would be by more than $100. And while that's not an insignificant amount, there likely aren't many groundbreaking upgrades to warrant anything more.</p><p>All of this is to say, if you want the absolute best that Android has to offer, wait a couple more months. If Samsung's past schedule is anything to go by, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should likely arrive sometime in late January or early February. At which point, you'll be able to see all of the cards in the deck, plus, if you'd still prefer the S25 Ultra, it'll probably be even less expensive.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7dd3ce3f-c778-45f1-9592-70dea57b39ee">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7aPuds4bUohAeDeEDRcqi.jpg' alt="samsung galaxy s25 ultra square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The incumbent</strong></em></p><p>If you're looking to upgrade, now might seem to be the best time to grab the Galaxy S25 Ultra.

      <![CDATA[<p>There's no question that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo's X200 Pro</a> continues one of the best phones of 2025. The design is elegant, it has top-notch hardware, a massive battery, and of the best camera systems on any phone today. I liked the X200 Pro so much that I used it more than any other device this year.</p><p>If there was one thing that Vivo needed to address, it was the software. While Funtouch OS 15 got a fresh coat of paint, it was clear that the interface was lagging behind OriginOS, Vivo's China-exclusive software.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the X300 and X300 Pro, Vivo is addressing that issue — these devices mark the global debut of OriginOS. There are other changes to the X300 and X300 Pro that make the phones stand out from their predecessors. I used both the X300 and X300 Pro for the better part of a day ahead of the global launch in Shanghai, China; I got the Chinese unit of the X300, and the global model of the X300 Pro that will make its way to select regions globally in the coming weeks.</p><p>While Vivo didn't share global pricing just yet, we know what these devices cost in China. The X300 starts at 4,399RMB ($618), and the X300 Pro debuts at 5,299RMB ($745). Both phones start with 256GB of storage, and go up to 1TB.</p><h2 id="same-great-design-even-better-2">Same great design, even better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SkJd3oXedDy6DRE5ftWQER" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SkJd3oXedDy6DRE5ftWQER.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo hasn't changed the design of the X300 Pro too much, and it looks similar to its predecessor. That's a good thing, and what I like is that mid-frame has a matte texture now, making it easier to hold and use the device. On that note, the back also has a matte finish, and the in-hand feel is noticeably better than the X200 Pro. The phone gets the same 6.78-inch AMOLED panel as last time, and it is just as vibrant.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q9BCfU8cSjojZpaByV8dCR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q9BCfU8cSjojZpaByV8dCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A new hardware addition is the shortcut button on the left. Vivo doesn't call it the Action Button, but it may as well have — it is nearly identical to what's available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>. The button lets you toggle ring/vibrate modes, launch the camera or flashlight, record notes, and transcribe in real-time among many others.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sg38gNderHUwFLx3hsPhTR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sg38gNderHUwFLx3hsPhTR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's good to see is that there's a double press gesture that lets you assign a secondary action to the button. While that's convenient, what I don't like is the settings interface that lets you customize the button; it is a wholesale copy of what you get in iOS.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CRrEEJR8kk7MCbPDsbB9JR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRrEEJR8kk7MCbPDsbB9JR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside of that, the design itself is broadly the same. The X300 Pro is a smidgen shorter and narrower than the X200 Pro, and coming in at 7.9mm, it is thinner as well. However, I didn't notice that because of the oversized camera island that dominates the design at the back. The island juts out considerably, but it is centered, so there isn't any wobble when using the phone.</p><h2 id="cameras-that-shine-2">Cameras that shine </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q26dKzSJ2Y3eDB7mbDm4PR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q26dKzSJ2Y3eDB7mbDm4PR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In fact, the camera island is nearly identical to that on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>, and this is by design. Vivo is rolling out its external lens attachment and camera grip this time on the X300 Pro, and as far as I can make out, it is the same as the X200 Ultra — I'll have to put both phones next to each other to confirm, but in terms of usability, they're identical.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h3gH8iWehtURcTYxScUzAR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h3gH8iWehtURcTYxScUzAR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To accommodate the lens and the custom case, Vivo made the requisite changes to the camera island of the X300 Pro. It isn't just the design either — the X300 Pro gets new cameras at the back, with Vivo aiming to outmatch the X200 Pro.</p><p>The X300 Pro gets a new 50MP Sony Lytia LYT-828 imaging sensor (the X200Pro had the LYT-818), and what's even more interesting is the 200MP telephoto lens, which now has a heavily customized Samsung HPB module. The wide-angle lens is still the 50MP JN1, which is unchanged for two years now. You get the same JN1 module acting as the selfie lens as well, similar to last year.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row

      <![CDATA[<p>There's no question that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo's X200 Pro</a> continues one of the best phones of 2025. The design is elegant, it has top-notch hardware, a massive battery, and of the best camera systems on any phone today. I liked the X200 Pro so much that I used it more than any other device this year.</p><p>If there was one thing that Vivo needed to address, it was the software. While Funtouch OS 15 got a fresh coat of paint, it was clear that the interface was lagging behind OriginOS, Vivo's China-exclusive software.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the X300 and X300 Pro, Vivo is addressing that issue — these devices mark the global debut of OriginOS. There are other changes to the X300 and X300 Pro that make the phones stand out from their predecessors. I used both the X300 and X300 Pro for the better part of a day ahead of the global launch in Shanghai, China; I got the Chinese unit of the X300, and the global model of the X300 Pro that will make its way to select regions globally in the coming weeks.</p><p>While Vivo didn't share global pricing just yet, we know what these devices cost in China. The X300 starts at 4,399RMB ($618), and the X300 Pro debuts at 5,299RMB ($745). Both phones start with 256GB of storage, and go up to 1TB.</p><h2 id="same-great-design-even-better-2">Same great design, even better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SkJd3oXedDy6DRE5ftWQER" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SkJd3oXedDy6DRE5ftWQER.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo hasn't changed the design of the X300 Pro too much, and it looks similar to its predecessor. That's a good thing, and what I like is that mid-frame has a matte texture now, making it easier to hold and use the device. On that note, the back also has a matte finish, and the in-hand feel is noticeably better than the X200 Pro. The phone gets the same 6.78-inch AMOLED panel as last time, and it is just as vibrant.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q9BCfU8cSjojZpaByV8dCR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q9BCfU8cSjojZpaByV8dCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A new hardware addition is the shortcut button on the left. Vivo doesn't call it the Action Button, but it may as well have — it is nearly identical to what's available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>. The button lets you toggle ring/vibrate modes, launch the camera or flashlight, record notes, and transcribe in real-time among many others.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sg38gNderHUwFLx3hsPhTR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sg38gNderHUwFLx3hsPhTR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's good to see is that there's a double press gesture that lets you assign a secondary action to the button. While that's convenient, what I don't like is the settings interface that lets you customize the button; it is a wholesale copy of what you get in iOS.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CRrEEJR8kk7MCbPDsbB9JR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRrEEJR8kk7MCbPDsbB9JR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside of that, the design itself is broadly the same. The X300 Pro is a smidgen shorter and narrower than the X200 Pro, and coming in at 7.9mm, it is thinner as well. However, I didn't notice that because of the oversized camera island that dominates the design at the back. The island juts out considerably, but it is centered, so there isn't any wobble when using the phone.</p><h2 id="cameras-that-shine-2">Cameras that shine </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q26dKzSJ2Y3eDB7mbDm4PR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q26dKzSJ2Y3eDB7mbDm4PR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In fact, the camera island is nearly identical to that on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>, and this is by design. Vivo is rolling out its external lens attachment and camera grip this time on the X300 Pro, and as far as I can make out, it is the same as the X200 Ultra — I'll have to put both phones next to each other to confirm, but in terms of usability, they're identical.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h3gH8iWehtURcTYxScUzAR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h3gH8iWehtURcTYxScUzAR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To accommodate the lens and the custom case, Vivo made the requisite changes to the camera island of the X300 Pro. It isn't just the design either — the X300 Pro gets new cameras at the back, with Vivo aiming to outmatch the X200 Pro.</p><p>The X300 Pro gets a new 50MP Sony Lytia LYT-828 imaging sensor (the X200Pro had the LYT-818), and what's even more interesting is the 200MP telephoto lens, which now has a heavily customized Samsung HPB module. The wide-angle lens is still the 50MP JN1, which is unchanged for two years now. You get the same JN1 module acting as the selfie lens as well, similar to last year.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's no question that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo's X200 Pro</a> continues one of the best phones of 2025. The design is elegant, it has top-notch hardware, a massive battery, and of the best camera systems on any phone today. I liked the X200 Pro so much that I used it more than any other device this year.</p><p>If there was one thing that Vivo needed to address, it was the software. While Funtouch OS 15 got a fresh coat of paint, it was clear that the interface was lagging behind OriginOS, Vivo's China-exclusive software.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the X300 and X300 Pro, Vivo is addressing that issue — these devices mark the global debut of OriginOS. There are other changes to the X300 and X300 Pro that make the phones stand out from their predecessors. I used both the X300 and X300 Pro for the better part of a day ahead of the global launch in Shanghai, China; I got the Chinese unit of the X300, and the global model of the X300 Pro that will make its way to select regions globally in the coming weeks.</p><p>While Vivo didn't share global pricing just yet, we know what these devices cost in China. The X300 starts at 4,399RMB ($618), and the X300 Pro debuts at 5,299RMB ($745). Both phones start with 256GB of storage, and go up to 1TB.</p><h2 id="same-great-design-even-better-2">Same great design, even better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SkJd3oXedDy6DRE5ftWQER" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SkJd3oXedDy6DRE5ftWQER.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo hasn't changed the design of the X300 Pro too much, and it looks similar to its predecessor. That's a good thing, and what I like is that mid-frame has a matte texture now, making it easier to hold and use the device. On that note, the back also has a matte finish, and the in-hand feel is noticeably better than the X200 Pro. The phone gets the same 6.78-inch AMOLED panel as last time, and it is just as vibrant.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q9BCfU8cSjojZpaByV8dCR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q9BCfU8cSjojZpaByV8dCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A new hardware addition is the shortcut button on the left. Vivo doesn't call it the Action Button, but it may as well have — it is nearly identical to what's available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>. The button lets you toggle ring/vibrate modes, launch the camera or flashlight, record notes, and transcribe in real-time among many others.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sg38gNderHUwFLx3hsPhTR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sg38gNderHUwFLx3hsPhTR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's good to see is that there's a double press gesture that lets you assign a secondary action to the button. While that's convenient, what I don't like is the settings interface that lets you customize the button; it is a wholesale copy of what you get in iOS.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CRrEEJR8kk7MCbPDsbB9JR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRrEEJR8kk7MCbPDsbB9JR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside of that, the design itself is broadly the same. The X300 Pro is a smidgen shorter and narrower than the X200 Pro, and coming in at 7.9mm, it is thinner as well. However, I didn't notice that because of the oversized camera island that dominates the design at the back. The island juts out considerably, but it is centered, so there isn't any wobble when using the phone.</p><h2 id="cameras-that-shine-2">Cameras that shine </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q26dKzSJ2Y3eDB7mbDm4PR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q26dKzSJ2Y3eDB7mbDm4PR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In fact, the camera island is nearly identical to that on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>, and this is by design. Vivo is rolling out its external lens attachment and camera grip this time on the X300 Pro, and as far as I can make out, it is the same as the X200 Ultra — I'll have to put both phones next to each other to confirm, but in terms of usability, they're identical.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h3gH8iWehtURcTYxScUzAR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h3gH8iWehtURcTYxScUzAR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To accommodate the lens and the custom case, Vivo made the requisite changes to the camera island of the X300 Pro. It isn't just the design either — the X300 Pro gets new cameras at the back, with Vivo aiming to outmatch the X200 Pro.</p><p>The X300 Pro gets a new 50MP Sony Lytia LYT-828 imaging sensor (the X200Pro had the LYT-818), and what's even more interesting is the 200MP telephoto lens, which now has a heavily customized Samsung HPB module. The wide-angle lens is still the 50MP JN1, which is unchanged for two years now. You get the same JN1 module acting as the selfie lens as well, similar to last year.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row

The calorie estimates were slightly different, which makes sense since each device uses its own algorithm to estimate calories burned. What impressed me was how well the AirPods tracked workout intensity and rhythm through the ear.</p><p>The heart rate is a direct physiological metric, while calorie burn depends more on how each device interprets your body data. The fact that the AirPods Pro 3 matched a dedicated fitness tracker in real-time heart rate accuracy was genuinely impressive.</p><p>For most people, especially casual gym-goers or those who don't like wearing a smartwatch, this level of precision is more than enough, in my opinion. You can simply pop in your AirPods, start your workout, and still get meaningful insights without any extra gear.</p><p>Of course, if you're looking for advanced fitness tracking, something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/whoop-no-intention-dropping-its-blood-pressure-insights-fda-report">Whoop</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> will still be the better choice. But for everyday users or those who occasionally forget their tracker at home, the AirPods Pro 3 does a surprisingly good job.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fa759024-2046-45f1-b48b-9c3bdf5805fe">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mDDakVQLoJ8mPmv3LBAhxd.jpg' alt="Apple AirPods Pro 3 render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">AirPods Pro 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Fitness in your ears</strong></em></p><p>The AirPods Pro 3 deliver an improved active noise cancelation along with spatial audio with dynamic head tracking.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Like clockwork, Apple introduced a new set of iPhones this September. But the highlight of the "Awe Dropping" keynote for me wasn't the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 lineup</a> or even the Apple Watch Series 11. It was the new AirPods Pro 3.</p><p>As an Android user for the past few years, I've always been a bit envious of how seamlessly the AirPods work within the Apple ecosystem. You can effortlessly switch between devices, enjoy that sleek connection animation every time you open the case, and experience some of the best active noise cancellation on any earbuds.</p><p>Sure, Android has plenty of strong contenders, too. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> and Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are both excellent wireless earbuds, and there are equally impressive options from brands like Bose and Sony, including the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/i-used-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-for-a-month">QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2</a> and Sony WF-1000XM5.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xoiyRb6NYBZqjTiHQuqhgM" name="airpods-pro-3-3" alt="AirPods Pro 3 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xoiyRb6NYBZqjTiHQuqhgM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/airpods-pro-3-vs-google-pixel-buds-pro-2-best-for-live-translate">AirPods Pro 3</a> were the turning point for me. After avoiding them for years, I finally bought them — and there's no doubt they're impressive. The active noise cancellation is truly top-tier.</p><p>I took two flights wearing them, and there was virtually no cabin noise at all. My Pixel Buds Pro 2 have been great at cutting down ambient sounds during travel, but this was on another level.</p><p>But that's not the feature I want other brands to copy. Earbuds will keep getting better at noise cancellation with each new generation, but the feature that genuinely blew me away on the AirPods Pro 3 is the built-in heart rate tracking.</p><h2 id="airpods-pro-3-can-now-track-your-workouts-too-2">AirPods Pro 3 can now track your workouts too</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uZ4AesiDxXvTXU5RJkY4KM" name="airpods-pro-3-2" alt="AirPods Pro 3 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uZ4AesiDxXvTXU5RJkY4KM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the new features Apple has added to the AirPods Pro 3 is an optical heart rate sensor. This means you can now use the AirPods Pro 3 to track your workouts. Similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">other fitness trackers</a>, the heart rate sensor flashes light to measure blood flow through the ear canal and shares that data with the iPhone's Fitness app.</p><p>The app then uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> to calculate workout metrics such as calories burned, steps taken, and distance covered. Apple even claims that the AirPods Pro 3 can track over fifty workouts, including running, yoga, and strength training.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SsTamjCr8e93Gcjk5FX9qJ" name="airpods-pro-3-workout-tracking-1" alt="Workout tracking in AirPods Pro 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SsTamjCr8e93Gcjk5FX9qJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And while it may sound strange to track workouts using earbuds instead of traditional fitness trackers or smartwatches, it's actually a pretty smart idea. The ear is actually a pretty stable location for heart rate monitoring, as the sensors are close to major arteries and less affected by movement during intense activity.</p><p>Apple also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-airpods-pro-3-the-ultimate-audio-experience/">says</a> that when both the AirPods Pro 3 and an Apple Watch are connected to your iPhone, the system automatically uses data from whichever device provides the most accurate readings at any given moment. This ensures the best coverage and accuracy throughout your workout.</p><p>That said, I decided to use the AirPods Pro 3 as my only health-tracking device for over a week, comparing it directly with a dedicated fitness tracker. And here's how the AirPods performed and whether they can really be considered reliable fitness trackers.</p><h2 id="how-reliable-is-the-airpods-pro-3-s-heart-rate-tracking-2">How reliable is the AirPods Pro 3's heart rate tracking?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="88t4GthGxRsZAT3pe46LzM" name="airpods-pro-3-1" alt="AirPods Pro 3 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/88t4GthGxRsZAT3pe46LzM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since I already wear the AirPods Pro 3 throughout my workout sessions, being able to track workouts means I can skip fitness wearables on my wrist, which feels like a win-win for me.</p><p>To truly assess whether the AirPods Pro 3 is a reliable fitness tracker, I tested them against another fitness tracker, the Huawei Watch Fit 4 Pro, which I paired with a different smartphone to prevent my iPhone from mixing the data. My goal was to see if the two devices recorded similar results, and the outcome was surprisingly close.</p><p>For context, my workouts usually include a mix of strength training, cardio, and stretching. Even on other fitness devices, I typically select the "Other" workout mode so I don't have to switch between multiple modes during my hour-long sessions.</p><p>I followed the same setup for this test. I started my workout on both devices at the same time and compared their heart rate and calorie readings throughout.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="evoBgYHUXT39hDQHvExdMD" name="airpods-pro-3-vs-fitness-tracker-2" alt="AirPods Pro 3 vs a fitness tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/evoBgYHUXT39hDQHvExdMD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4ws5MsQLnvywNzfr9UAWKD" name="airpods-pro-3-vs-fitness-tracker-3" alt="AirPods Pro 3 vs a fitness tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ws5MsQLnvywNzfr9UAWKD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rnZQ4ZrTvRh4Q9jVJdHELD" name="airpods-pro-3-vs-fitness-tracker-4" alt="AirPods Pro 3 vs a fitness tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rnZQ4ZrTvRh4Q9jVJdHELD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TPXhjb8iqjmcxiycAZUVCD" name="airpods-pro-3-vs-fitness-tracker-1" alt="AirPods Pro 3 vs a fitness tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TPXhjb8iqjmcxiycAZUVCD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>To my surprise, the heart rate numbers from both the AirPods Pro 3 and the Huawei Watch Fit 4 Pro were almost identical every time I checked.

The column looks to expand and go in-depth on topics in the Android space without any limitations.</p></div></div><p>Last week, a Reddit user took to the platform to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-may-feature-apples-bold-cosmic-orange-leaks-reveal">complain about a Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra leak </a>that showcased three phones with different colorways, of which one was in a striking bright orange popsicle color.</p><p>The user posted that they were “so done with this orange color tbh…,” which then resulted in a slew of commenters agreeing and saying “that color has to be a joke,” or that Samsung is “totally Apple’s copycat. What a shame.”</p><p>Okay, let’s get it out of the way: yes, the color is nearly identical to the recently launched iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange. But I want to point out that Samsung did have an orange colorway called Titanium Orange on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, and Google had the Oh So Orange colorway for its Pixel 4. Both of these phones launched much earlier than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> color.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/comments/1o022sc/dummies_of_galaxy_s26_ultra_leaked_online_guys_im">Dummies of Galaxy S26 Ultra leaked online. Guys, I'm so done with this orange colour tbh…</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy">r/samsunggalaxy</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>I’m about to get really granular here. Google announced the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-5-looks-back-basics-model-we-can-get-excited-about"> Pixel 5</a> in the Sorta Sage colorway on October 15, 2020, while Apple announced the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/iphone-12-step-behind-android-competition-5g-battery-tests"> iPhone 12 </a>in the Green color, which is <em>extremely</em> similar to Sorta Sage, but it was announced on October 23, 2020.</p><p>But who cares? Just because one company does it and another does something similar doesn’t mean it’s a sell-out company. One poster wrote, “Samsung’s target audience is Apple users. It’s not surprising.

As someone who's tested nearly every smartwatch and fitness watch brand, I put the Watch 4 through its paces to see how well its accuracy holds up against a premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>, judging when Fitbit beats the competition and when it falls short.</p><p>I took the Pixel Watch 4 out for a half-marathon and a second 19-mile run — along with shorter runs and a hike — comparing its HR accuracy against a chest strap and its GPS accuracy against the dual-band <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Garmin Forerunner 970</a>.</p><p>I also compared stats like step count, elevation, and running form, tested how Google's new activity detection works, and decided whether the Watch 4's new 3,000-nit display and improved battery life make a real difference.</p><p>I can't <em>fully</em> judge the Watch 4 fitness experience until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/fitbit/fitbit-ai-personal-health-coach-preview/">Gemini-backed Fitbit coach</a> arrives later this month. But it's fair to say the Watch 4 is a surprisingly strong fitness watch option — even if it's still missing some essentials that serious athletes need.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gps-accuracy"><span>GPS accuracy</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BrKk4JjhhU2VmW9TfT7Wwh" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-vs-Garmin-Forerunner-970" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 4 (left, on a table) showing a post-run summary of distance, time, pace, and HR, while the Garmin Forerunner 970 (right) shows distance, time, and pace with a GPS map.

The final result: Garmin measured 0.02mi more and COROS 0.01mi more than Google, all with the same 9:23/mile average. I'll spare you 19 miles' worth of screenshots, but this was the Watch 4's best tracking result, with only the occasional sections where it strayed off-path.</p><p>On a related note, the Pixel Watch 4's elevation tracking was only 0.8 feet off of Garmin's for the 19-mile run, though the gap was 3m for my half-marathon. I didn't get a chance to climb a mountain or anything, but I generally trust its results.</p><p>Overall, the Pixel Watch 4's GPS accuracy is as dependable as I hoped. It's also more efficient than I expected, only using about 7.5% of my battery per hour of tracking for a couple of runs. It guzzled more battery during my 19-mile run, hitting closer to 12% battery used per hour, but still had more than enough juice for a long activity.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-hr-accuracy"><span>HR accuracy</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XLipw7DBBpETX5ibvj59gF" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-HR-Tile" alt="The 45mm Google Pixel Watch 4 on a man's wrist showing the Heart Rate tile, showing a HR high and low on a graph, with the current HR (66) below the graph." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XLipw7DBBpETX5ibvj59gF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google promised that the Pixel Watch 3 had its "most accurate" HR algorithm, and didn't bring it up with the Watch 4, so we can safely assume it's unchanged.

The final result: Garmin measured 0.02mi more and COROS 0.01mi more than Google, all with the same 9:23/mile average. I'll spare you 19 miles' worth of screenshots, but this was the Watch 4's best tracking result, with only the occasional sections where it strayed off-path.</p><p>On a related note, the Pixel Watch 4's elevation tracking was only 0.8 feet off of Garmin's for the 19-mile run, though the gap was 3m for my half-marathon. I didn't get a chance to climb a mountain or anything, but I generally trust its results.</p><p>Overall, the Pixel Watch 4's GPS accuracy is as dependable as I hoped. It's also more efficient than I expected, only using about 7.5% of my battery per hour of tracking for a couple of runs. It guzzled more battery during my 19-mile run, hitting closer to 12% battery used per hour, but still had more than enough juice for a long activity.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-hr-accuracy"><span>HR accuracy</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XLipw7DBBpETX5ibvj59gF" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-HR-Tile" alt="The 45mm Google Pixel Watch 4 on a man's wrist showing the Heart Rate tile, showing a HR high and low on a graph, with the current HR (66) below the graph." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XLipw7DBBpETX5ibvj59gF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google promised that the Pixel Watch 3 had its "most accurate" HR algorithm, and didn't bring it up with the Watch 4, so we can safely assume it's unchanged.

That's all well and good for Premium subscribers.</p><p>But the watch itself will only judge your strength workouts on basics like heart rate and calories burned, whereas Garmin tracks individual reps for each exercise type, such as bench presses.

It's also more efficient than I expected, only using about 7.5% of my battery per hour of tracking for a couple of runs.

However, one often overlooked category is hybrid smartwatches, which blend a traditional mechanical watch with smart features.</p><p>These "smart" watches may seem boring and not very smart at all, but there's actually a lot more to them than meets the eye. Inside their often small displays is a host of features for owners to utilize while keeping things minimal. It's part of what makes these watches so versatile, and among the reasons why you should consider a hybrid smartwatch as your next wearable buy.</p><h2 id="form-over-function-2">Form over function</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8mwc4eXw8WkS7G8gVJDXoe" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8mwc4eXw8WkS7G8gVJDXoe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One complaint many have about smartwatches is that they <em>look </em>like smartwatches. Unlike the Apple Watch, which is the farthest from a traditional watch by design, Android smartwatches often try to emulate the traditional watch style, with varying degrees of success.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-early-impressions">Pixel Watch</a> is unapologetically a smartwatch, thanks to its bulbous design and domed display, particularly on the latest model. Then there's the Galaxy Watch, which recently updated its design, but still retains a very "smartwatch" design. The closest we've gotten to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> that resemble traditional watches are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> and the Fossil watches of yore, both of which emulate the look and feel of a watch while retaining a rotating crown.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AjASiMALJuaqzT8eUv3XAQ" name="smartwatch-beauty-pageant-all-candidates" alt="A side view of thirteen smartwatches sitting side-by-side on a desk.

If it weren't for the display found in some shape or form on a hybrid watch, you likely wouldn't know there was anything "smart" about it.</p><p>For some, this is a benefit.

Out of 13 smartwatches, the ScanWatch 2 won the most votes, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> came in second place.</p><p>Meanwhile, the more mainstream <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> came in second to last place, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> was in 8th place. The results suggest that, to the everyday person, the classic watch style is the best design option.</p><h2 id="keep-it-simple-2">Keep it simple</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GpkUFxtS3gxXouBCobMWFj" name="Garmin-vivomove-trend-notifications.jpeg" alt="The notifications screen on the Garmin vívoactive Trend" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GpkUFxtS3gxXouBCobMWFj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from a classic design that almost anyone can get into, one of the best aspects of a hybrid smartwatch is its simplicity. Compared to the large, vibrant touch screens on a regular smartwatch, a hybrid smartwatch normally has a smaller display with minimal navigation. There are no apps to download, no watch faces to customize; you just have a set of features and settings that you can turn on or off.</p><p>Even a hybrid watch like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivomove-trend-review">Garmin Vivomove Trend</a> has a full touch screen, but it only provides very basic menus while giving you more room to read messages and notifications.</p><p>Some may prefer this minimalism, as it offers much less distraction compared to smartwatches, which always seem to invite you to look at them. After all, if the point of a smartwatch is that you're glancing at your phone less, then that becomes moot if you're constantly looking at your watch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nv6FVK3he4rcEynmWwzKRm" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-3" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 next to a phone with the Withings app open to a workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nv6FVK3he4rcEynmWwzKRm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4021" height="2262" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A hybrid smartwatch will still get things done in the background. They can measure health metrics such as heart rate, blood oxygen, and even ECG on some models. Think of it as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> with a watch face that still gathers important data and pings you for notifications you might want to pay attention to. The minimal displays are best used for glanceable information, forcing you to decide whether something is worth grabbing your phone for or if it can wait.</p><p>You can still track workouts on something like the ScanWatch 2 or Garmin Instinc Crossover, but the menus are often simplified and options are fairly limited, so you're not spending all your time navigating.</p><p>Basically, a hybrid smartwatch isn't begging for your attention; it's for anyone looking for a more passive health tracking experience. Otherwise, it'll function as a pretty normal watch.</p><h2 id="battery-life-for-days-or-weeks-2">Battery life for days (or weeks)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DCqBBueQe9EtWcG7at75cm" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-5" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 next to a phone with the Withings app open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DCqBBueQe9EtWcG7at75cm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4062" height="2285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Because there's no big, battery-sucking touch screen to deal with, some hybrid smartwatches will usually have better battery life than the average smartwatch. Take the ScanWatch 2; on average, it can last just over a month before you need to find your charger. Meanwhile, the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch</a> or Pixel Watch models will only last a few days at most.</p><p>The Vivomove Trend lasts only five days, likely due to its large touch screen, but that's more than you'll get from an Apple Watch or most Wear OS watches. The exception is the OnePlus Watch 3, which also manages up to five days of battery life, although it is quite large.</p><p>That said, the less you have to charge your watch, the better it can function effectively as a watch, especially when it comes to performing its primary function: telling time. It's kind of dead weight if it's constantly dead.</p><h2 id="just-one-problem-2">Just one problem</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3580px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="y5jrdeXpHBE5yYqXgHmX8Q" name="Fossil-Gen-6-Hybrid-Wellness-Edition-review-indoors.jpg" alt="The Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness Edition lying on a flat surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y5jrdeXpHBE5yYqXgHmX8Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3580" height="2014" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, when it comes to hybrid smartwatches, the selection is pretty small. Fossil had a pretty solid selection, but when it bowed out of the smartwatch market, it took all its brands with it, including Skagen. That left a huge gap in the hybrid smartwatch market (not to mention the Wear OS market), which is mostly filled by Withings and its various ScanWatch models.</p><p>There's also the Garmin Vivomove Trend or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-instinct-crossover-amoled-hybrid-watch-announced">Instinct Crossover</a> series, but it really depends on the style you're going for. Otherwise, your best bet for a hybrid smartwatch is the Withings ScanWatch 2, which just got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/scanwatch-2/42blue/shop">2025 refresh</a> earlier this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The answer lies not in rejecting new technology, but in harnessing its power responsibly and thoughtfully, with the best interests of everyone, including our children, at heart.</p>]]>

The Pixel Watch 1 wasn't included, but there was reason to hope its update would come later in October. But Google has told Android Central not to expect the update.</p><p>Google promised "at least three years" of software updates for its Pixel Watches, but it wasn't clear if that included three version updates or not. The Pixel Watch 1 launched in October 2022 with Wear OS 3.5 and is currently running the April 2025 Wear OS 5.1 update.</p><p>Google initially told us it had no comment about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch 1</a>, but a Google spokesperson sent us a statement on Friday that clarified its update strategy:</p><div><blockquote><p>We’re committed to providing a great experience across the entire Pixel Watch portfolio to make your devices get better over time, which includes three years of essential support to deliver new features, enhancements, and security updates. Pixel Watch 1 did not get Wear OS 6 with the October update and will continue to run on Wear OS 5.1. Please be on the lookout for any future security and bug fixes for Pixel Watch 1.</p></blockquote></div><p>The quote included a link to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/12799779?hl=en">official Pixel Watch update page</a>, which confirms the October 2025 deadline for Pixel Watch 1 updates.</p><p>While the spokesperson didn't definitively say, "No," the statement suggests there won't be a second October update for the Watch 1 with Wear OS 6, and that any updates after October will be limited to security patches.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-downloading-update-forced.jpg" alt="Downloading an update on the Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We had reason to hope that the first Pixel Watch would receive a third major update. Samsung promises four years of software updates, and it has apparently confirmed plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/surprise-one-ui-8-watch-update-is-reviving-this-legacy-galaxy-watch">bring One UI 8 Watch to the Galaxy Watch 4</a> in late 2025, which will be its fourth major update.</p><p>Instead, it appears that Pixel Watches will stick to two version updates and three years of security updates, with occasional security patches after the three-year window.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 1 uses an outdated Exynos 9110 chip originally used in Tizen OS Galaxy Watches. Perhaps Google didn't think Wear OS 6 could run smoothly on older hardware, even with 2GB of RAM. But when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-5">Pixel Watch 5</a> launches next year, the Watch 2 may not receive Wear OS 7 even though it shares the Watch 3's Snapdragon hardware.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-6-is-one-of-the-best-parts-of-the-pixel-watch-4">Wear OS 6 has impressed us</a> so far with its stylish scrolling animations, revamped Tiles, dynamic color theming, custom watch faces, and other functional fixes. It's arguably the best smartwatch update Google has released, which makes it a shame that Pixel Watch 1 owners may never see it.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-early-impressions">Pixel Watch 4</a> launched on October 9 with Wear OS 6; based on Google's update strategy, it seems we can expect it to receive Wear OS 8 in 2027, but not Wear OS 9 in 2028.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>It's obvious that phone brands are turning to AI; with year-on-year upgrades slowing down considerably, manufacturers are looking for anything that can give their devices an edge, and this is where AI comes in. These days, most phone launches (at least on the Android side) are filled with how AI is going to overhaul how you use your phone.</p><p>The reality isn't quite so grand, but brands like Google and Samsung are doing a great job integrating AI-assisted features in a meaningful way on their phones. So if you got a recent phone and haven't looked into all the AI utilities yet, this post should be a good starting point.</p><p>I'm going to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> to showcase AI features on Android. While most brands have a suite of AI offerings, Samsung does the best job both with the number of features available, and how they're organized. In short, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> makes it extremely easy to see which features are actually available on your phone, and how to use them.</p><p>Google also has a strong suite of AI features, but trying to find out what's available on a device like the Pixel 10 Pro XL is like a hidden objects game — you have to constantly dig through the interface to uncover features, and if you're lucky, you'll find a few you'll end up using. Thankfully, Samsung doesn't make things anywhere as convoluted, and given that it is the biggest Android brand by a lot, its features get the most mainstream usage. With that out of the way, let's dive in.</p><h2 id="search-anything-with-google-2">Search anything with Google</h2><p>Google's Circle to Search is highly useful as it lets you search what's on your screen. It's extremely easy too; all you have to do is hold down on the navigation bar, and circle around the object you want to search. The idea is to make it easier to search; if you're scrolling through Instagram and see an interesting pair of shoes (it's basically my entire feed now), you can just draw around the object and search on Google with minimum effort. Here's how to do it:</p><ol start="1"><li>Navigate to <strong>whatever you want to search</strong>.</li><li><strong>Press down</strong> on the navigation bar (the horizontal bar at the bottom of your screen).</li><li>Draw around the <strong>object of interest</strong>.</li><li>Google automatically surfaces details.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4380px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.53%;"><img id="foNgfqpV8Xrd86krKrrXNi" name="Circle to Search" alt="Circle to Search on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/foNgfqpV8Xrd86krKrrXNi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4380" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a nifty utility, and it's there when you want it and hidden away if you don't ever intend to use it.</p><h2 id="translate-anything-with-ease-in-real-time-2">Translate anything with ease — in real-time</h2><p>Another good use of AI is real-time translation. Samsung phones have a few ways where they leverage translation features. The one that I think is the best is Interpreter, as the name suggests, it offers real-time translation, so if you're traveling abroad or don't know the local language, you can use this to get around with ease. Using it as easy as it gets:</p><ol start="1"><li>Pull down the <strong>notification shade</strong>.</li><li>In the quick settings tiles, select <strong>Interpreter</strong>.</li><li><strong>Choose the language</strong> (you can select from over 30 languages) you want to translate, and just hit the record button.</li><li>You'll see a <strong>real-time translation</strong> into the target language you've selected, and it automatically narrates as well.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4380px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.53%;"><img id="7hhqvurpqyjxHoxnQDTP7n" name="Interpreter" alt="Interpreter in Galaxy AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7hhqvurpqyjxHoxnQDTP7n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4380" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="edit-your-photos-the-way-you-want-2">Edit your photos the way you want</h2><p>My biggest AI-related use case is image editing. Whether it's taking out unwanted objects from the background of photos or tweaking colors, you get plenty of useful features around this area.</p><ol start="1"><li>Go to the Gallery.</li><li>Choose the image you want to edit.</li><li>Choose the AI icon (the one with the stars at the bottom of the page).</li><li>You'll see the Generative edit window, and here you can draw objects you want to erase.</li><li>Hit the Generate button. This will erase the objects you've selected and fill in the image.</li><li>Hit Save to preserve the new image.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4380px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.53%;"><img id="5mWXXRN7zRuvhcShVCZTV4" name="Galaxy AI Generative Edit" alt="Generative Edit in Galaxy AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5mWXXRN7zRuvhcShVCZTV4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4380" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another cool feature in Samsung phones is Sketch to image. As the name indicates, you can basically doodle on an image, and it will fill in that object and integrate it into the existing image, making it look natural.</p><ol start="1"><li>Choose an image and select the <strong>AI icon</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Sketch to image</strong>.</li><li><strong>Doodle whatever you want</strong> to add in the image and hit <strong>Generate</strong>.</li><li>You'll see the results of the AI-generated creation. If you like what you see, you can hit Save.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4380px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.53%;"><img id="kMhfgrpvu7RgnJpdCLxtn7" name="Galaxy AI" alt="Sketch to image in Galaxy AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kMhfgrpvu7RgnJpdCLxtn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4380" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="unsure-of-what-to-write-let-ai-do-it-2">Unsure of what to write?

      <![CDATA[<p>It's obvious that phone brands are turning to AI; with year-on-year upgrades slowing down considerably, manufacturers are looking for anything that can give their devices an edge, and this is where AI comes in.

So if you got a recent phone and haven't looked into all the AI utilities yet, this post should be a good starting point.</p><p>I'm going to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> to showcase AI features on Android. While most brands have a suite of AI offerings, Samsung does the best job both with the number of features available, and how they're organized. In short, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> makes it extremely easy to see which features are actually available on your phone, and how to use them.</p><p>Google also has a strong suite of AI features, but trying to find out what's available on a device like the Pixel 10 Pro XL is like a hidden objects game — you have to constantly dig through the interface to uncover features, and if you're lucky, you'll find a few you'll end up using. Thankfully, Samsung doesn't make things anywhere as convoluted, and given that it is the biggest Android brand by a lot, its features get the most mainstream usage. With that out of the way, let's dive in.</p><h2 id="search-anything-with-google-2">Search anything with Google</h2><p>Google's Circle to Search is highly useful as it lets you search what's on your screen.

Google has already switched to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-esim">eSIM-only Pixel 10</a> models in the U.S., and it looks like Samsung could be preparing to do the same with the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-release-date">Galaxy S26 series</a>.</p><p>While Apple and Google have made efforts to simplify eSIM transfers between their platforms with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">iOS 26</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16">Android 16</a>, moving an eSIM from an iPhone to a Samsung Galaxy device in the U.S. still requires you to contact your carrier. According to a new report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsungs-making-one-ui-more-esim-friendly-with-iphone-porting-tool-3606214/">Android Authority</a>, Samsung is now working on a tool that will remove that hassle entirely.</p><p>The report claims that Samsung is developing a feature for One UI 8.5 that will let users transfer eSIMs from an iPhone to a Galaxy phone without involving their carrier.

      <![CDATA[<p>Curious why we're talking about Samsung's next Galaxy Unpacked so early, when they usually launch their flagship phones in January? Well, there have been a ton of Galaxy S26 leaks lately, and we thought you'd want all of it in one spot!

This could be what makes the Galaxy S26 series' big product stand out from everything else out there right now.  We first saw mentions of this feature back in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/articles/galaxy-s26-ultra-could-shield-101906989.html">September</a>; however,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-shows-first-look-at-built-in-privacy-display"> just a few days ago, another tipster</a> posted screenshots showing the toggle option for this "privacy display."</p><p>As the name suggests, this feature could limit how much of your screen is visible to those standing next to you, especially when you're in a crowded area and entering your banking details on your device.</p><p>That said, this feature is said to be embedded within the workings of the new flagship.  It will automatically turn on when you're using sensitive apps — like banking, messaging, or payment services — or when the phone detects you’re in a crowded place. It will apparently use what Samsung calls "Flex Magic Pixel technology," which tweaks how pixels behave in real-time, probably with AI, to make screen content super hard to read unless you are the owner of the device.</p><p>There also seems to be multiple levels of privacy, including a “Maximum Privacy” mode that heavily dims the screen for stronger protection, and manual settings for people who prefer full control.</p><h2 id="galaxy-buds-4-2">Galaxy Buds 4</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Buds 4 Pro Software testing has started ‼️Build test :R640XXU0AYI1/R640XXU0AYI1 pic.twitter.com/lvSL008Srd<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1969164703273287826">September 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>As for the next-gen Galaxy Buds, we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/amid-one-ui-8-5-leaks-alleged-galaxy-buds-4-pro-testing-begins-rumor">have a few leaks so far</a> that hint at their existence. Last month, a leak suggested that the Korean OEM has started naming its next buds, the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, using what appear to be internal code names. The test server build supposedly holds clues in its code about the alleged earbuds, with hints to base and Pro model numbers SM-R540 and SM-R640, respectively.</p><p>Since they were found in the strings in Samsung's test server code, there's not enough information about them, so nothing on specs or features as yet. But we do know that they exist and are in the works. In another leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Alfaturk16/status/1969164703273287826" target="_blank">tipster Alfaturk on X</a>, it claims the company has also started developing the firmware for these alleged Buds 4 and 4 Pro models.

The recent one shows the device sporting a U-shaped fold, all but confirming that Samsung’s Trifold features a central cover display flanked by two panels that fold around it. The animation also shows another interesting detail about the alleged cameras on the device, which lets you shoot selfies with the main rear cameras.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1595px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="unfolded form of the Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1595" height="897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @TechHighest / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, it could feature a "newly developed display and film."

Samsung was rumored to launch its Trifold phone first only in South Korea, before expanding it across other regions based on how the phone fares in the domestic market. However, it might be switching things up with the Trifold by launching it simultaneously in both its home market and the U.S., rather than staggering the release.</p><p>However, it's unclear if a U.S. launch will happen at the same time, if at all. A staggered release could happen, which means we'd have to wait a bit longer to see the Trifold stateside, possibly during the Galaxy S26 launch. It's conjecture at this point, but either way, we'll be keeping an eye on this one.</p>]]>

Samsung was rumored to launch its Trifold phone first only in South Korea, before expanding it across other regions based on how the phone fares in the domestic market. However, it might be switching things up with the Trifold by launching it simultaneously in both its home market and the U.S., rather than staggering the release.</p><p>However, it's unclear if a U.S. launch will happen at the same time, if at all. A staggered release could happen, which means we'd have to wait a bit longer to see the Trifold stateside, possibly during the Galaxy S26 launch. It's conjecture at this point, but either way, we'll be keeping an eye on this one.</p>]]>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Curious why we're talking about Samsung's next Galaxy Unpacked so early, when they usually launch their flagship phones in January? Well, there have been a ton of Galaxy S26 leaks lately, and we thought you'd want all of it in one spot! From how to watch to what we're expecting, we've got you covered right here.</p><p>This year, we expect to see a possible shuffle in the Galaxy S26 lineup with rumors about Samsung<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-switch-things-up-with-its-galaxy-s26-lineup"> giving up the S26 Plus variant</a> for a more premium Edge model. Other than that, we expect to see some software upgrades, possibly the Galaxy Buds 4, and of course, we're hoping to see Samsung's most hyped tri-fold device, which could launch soon in select countries.</p><h2 id="how-to-watch-the-2026-galaxy-unpacked-2">How to watch the 2026 Galaxy Unpacked</h2><p>This one seems simple and most predictable. While a lucky few journalists and influencers get to attend Samsung's Unpacked events in person, the rest of us have to make do with a live stream of the launch on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_3571213889837284912&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">official website</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung" target="_blank">YouTube platforms</a>. Samsung will likely release its live stream link in the days leading up to the event, and you can click the "notify me" button to receive a heads-up before the live stream begins.</p><p>While it's too early for us to know exactly when and where the event will take place, if Samsung sticks to its usual schedule, it'll probably be in the second or third week of January. The "where" is still a secret!</p><p>So, what can we expect from the Galaxy Unpacked event, and will Samsung's new offerings level up this year? Let's "Unpack" it for you.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-plus-ultra-and-edge-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro, Plus, Ultra, and Edge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-lineup" alt="CAD renders of the Galaxy S26 lineup including the Ultra and Pro models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung could be switching things up with its next flagship lineup, as several leaks have indicated so far. For what it's worth, it won't see a drastic shift, as it will allegedly hold onto its basic trio — the Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. We've heard chatter that Samsung could potentially rebrand the base model as the Galaxy S26 Pro.</p><p>There are also rumors of a fourth phone joining the party this year. The Galaxy S26 Edge was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-could-drop-its-plus-variant-for-the-edge-shaking-up-the-galaxy-s26-lineup">thought to replace the Plus</a>, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">recent rumors</a> suggest Samsung is now considering adding both phones to the lineup.</p><p>As for the trio's design, Samsung doesn't seem to be making drastic changes to it, at least according to the latest leaks. The devices appear to resemble their predecessors; however, they might feature a thinner profile, similar to the recent Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.  If the Korean OEM is chasing thinness, it could end up using thinner camera modules that are integrated with the rear panel, making the frame sleeker. CAD-based renders of Samsung’s upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> lineup back the fact that the Pro and Ultra models won't look different.</p><p>However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-and-s26-pro-could-get-a-subtle-but-noticeable-reshuffle" target="_blank">Galaxy S26 Edge</a> could show up with its rear panel dominated by a camera island that spans nearly the phone’s entire width, much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/apple" target="_blank">Apple</a>’s iPhone 17 Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.93%;"><img id="unZnRYwhUK29vb85wttHVZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-4" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/unZnRYwhUK29vb85wttHVZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1938" height="1084" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of cameras, the Galaxy S26 Pro would retain its predecessor's camera array. On the other hand, the Galaxy S26 Ultra might get a fresh set of lenses. Leaks suggest that there could be a larger 200MP Sony main sensor, while others suggest minimal hardware changes for the quad-camera setup with a new 200MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 10MP 3x telephoto, and 50MP 5x periscope lens.</p><p>Rumors also indicate that the new<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5"> Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 </a>chip could power phones in some regions, while others could get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-might-rock-the-exynos-2600-chip-but-only-in-this-region">Exynos 2600 processor</a>. All models are rumored to feature a base of at least 12GB of RAM, with a possible jump to 16GB as an option. The series will launch with Android 16 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-already-chasing-one-ui-8-5-new-leak-spots-galaxy-s25-test">Samsung's One UI 8.5.</a></p><p>As for the battery, the base version could feature a 4,300mAh battery, the Edge variant might have a larger 4,200mAh battery, and the Ultra is expected to get a massive 5,500mAh battery.

Last month, a leak suggested that the Korean OEM has started naming its next buds, the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, using what appear to be internal code names. The test server build supposedly holds clues in its code about the alleged earbuds, with hints to base and Pro model numbers SM-R540 and SM-R640, respectively.</p><p>Since they were found in the strings in Samsung's test server code, there's not enough information about them, so nothing on specs or features as yet. But we do know that they exist and are in the works. In another leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Alfaturk16/status/1969164703273287826" target="_blank">tipster Alfaturk on X</a>, it claims the company has also started developing the firmware for these alleged Buds 4 and 4 Pro models. We'll probably see more as we get closer to the launch, allegedly in January.</p><h2 id="galaxy-g-fold-tri-fold-2">Galaxy G Fold (Tri-fold)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yJF6kbcTg82QcDvhLffvCi" name="Samsung Foldable OLED" alt="Samsung Foldable OLED demo panels at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yJF6kbcTg82QcDvhLffvCi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has repeatedly dropped hints that it is working on a tri-fold device. Be it during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">January Unpacked</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC</a> this year. A Korean news website reported earlier this year that Samsung Electronics was working on launching the "Galaxy G Fold" and the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but that didn't happen.</p><p>We haven't seen official renders or even leaks of the Galaxy Z TriFold; however, animation videos have been popping up quite a bit. The recent one shows the device sporting a U-shaped fold, all but confirming that Samsung’s Trifold features a central cover display flanked by two panels that fold around it. The animation also shows another interesting detail about the alleged cameras on the device, which lets you shoot selfies with the main rear cameras.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1595px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="unfolded form of the Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1595" height="897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @TechHighest / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, it could feature a "newly developed display and film." Other alleged specifications are that the device's main internal display will be around 9.96 inches, and the external display will be 6.49 inches, which is slightly larger than the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally" target="_blank">Huawei</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally"> Mate XT.</a></p><p>In terms of design, it is said to sport a titanium frame, 16GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon chipset, and without a doubt, it will come with a hefty price tag.</p><p>More recently, a "person familiar with the company's plans" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-trifold-may-debut-in-the-us-amid-rumors-of-a-simultaneous-launch-event">told CNN that the U.S.</a> has been a part of their launch discussions. Samsung was rumored to launch its Trifold phone first only in South Korea, before expanding it across other regions based on how the phone fares in the domestic market. However, it might be switching things up with the Trifold by launching it simultaneously in both its home market and the U.S., rather than staggering the release.</p><p>However, it's unclear if a U.S. launch will happen at the same time, if at all. A staggered release could happen, which means we'd have to wait a bit longer to see the Trifold stateside, possibly during the Galaxy S26 launch. It's conjecture at this point, but either way, we'll be keeping an eye on this one.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The X200 FE comes with a smaller 6.31-inch panel, and it doesn't have much in the way of similarities to the regular X200 or X200 Pro — it has a distinct identity, and it looks great.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WSvvEPhDGfAnAuF6kKQvjQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WSvvEPhDGfAnAuF6kKQvjQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo still doesn't sell its phones outside Southeast Asian markets, and as a result, the X200 FE is limited to select regions. The good news is that it is available in India, where it currently costs ₹54,999 ($620) for the 12GB/256GB model. That's in line with what the OnePlus 13s costs in the country as well, so there isn't much to differentiate either device in that regard.</p><h2 id="clean-design-with-usability-in-mind-2">Clean design with usability in mind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7gnfDKBvVGVoLXFdPLwWkQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7gnfDKBvVGVoLXFdPLwWkQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like the design of the X200 FE. The phone has flat sides, but they're comfortable to hold and use, and at 186g, it isn't anywhere as heavy as the X200 Pro. In fact, it is a smidgen thinner than the 13s as well, and the in-hand feel is one of the reasons why I enjoy using this device so much.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="GnNMEY5VJ2wofXhLq8rihQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GnNMEY5VJ2wofXhLq8rihQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I got the Frost Blue color of the device, but the Amber Yellow is the variant to get if you need a device that grabs attention immediately. The frosted glass finish at the back ensures it's easy to hold, and the mid-frame gets a matte texture. If anything, the X200 FE is better than the X200 Pro when it comes to usability, and I'm guessing that was the point.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4966px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="XVMzoTAQUkLGW8FPm9WddQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XVMzoTAQUkLGW8FPm9WddQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4966" height="2797" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5017px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7AzSv4QunGJqGbaV3bc7dQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7AzSv4QunGJqGbaV3bc7dQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5017" height="2826" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="e8LMuMWJh4CaYvhVQgTqcQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8LMuMWJh4CaYvhVQgTqcQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="oKjhnJrASjCHamieorEtfQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oKjhnJrASjCHamieorEtfQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Vivo did a good job in this regard, and the build quality is rock-solid — not that this was an issue on any Vivo phone in recent years. And just like the regular X200 models, the X200 FE gets IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance. Now, I haven't tried shooting jets of hot water at any of these phones with IP69 ingress protection, so I'll have Vivo's word that the phone withstands pressurized jets up to 80 degrees.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5172px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="eVWPomyqUpYpfyEi6bqNfQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eVWPomyqUpYpfyEi6bqNfQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5172" height="2913" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only issue I have with the design is the camera island at the back; the oblong design meshes well with the overall aesthetic, but the island protrudes from the body, and makes the X200 FE wobble quite a bit when using it on a table. Of course, it isn't anywhere as extreme as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but this just wasn't an issue on the X200 or X200 Pro because of the massive camera modules on those devices. Vivo should have retained a similar design at least, albeit a smidgen smaller.</p><h2 id="the-hardware-you-need-2">The hardware you need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4961px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="BCnVJQbaqoYakeEwUnKStQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCnVJQbaqoYakeEwUnKStQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4961" height="2794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo knows what it's doing with the hardware, and there isn't much to talk about in this area. The 6.31-inch AMOLED panel has good color vibrancy and contrast levels, and you get the same level of customization as the other X200 devices. It has the Shield Glass that Vivo has been using for a while instead of Corning's Gorilla Glass solution, and it has proven to be reliable in my usage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pdVp3qFyUusf6B5E7k5VkQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdVp3qFyUusf6B5E7k5VkQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I had the X200 FE for just over two months now, and in that time, the phone took a few tumbles thankfully, it came away unscathed each time. The panel gets 2,160Hz PWM dimming along with the usual 120Hz refresh, and it is fluid — just like other Vivo phones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4939px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="wrMC4i8jG8t6Nc7vUJMseQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wrMC4i8jG8t6Nc7vUJMseQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4939" height="2782" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In short, there are no issues with the smaller-sized panel. It may not have the real estate of the X200 Pro, but it's just as good to play games on, and it gets bright in outdoor use. On that note, the Dimensity 9300+ platform powering the phone is a known quantity, and it does a good job handling visually-demanding games. I would have liked the same Dimensity 9400 as the rest of the X200 range, but the older platform still has a lot to offer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7njJ6okK2ceWpkQcAWsdbQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7njJ6okK2ceWpkQcAWsdbQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5105" height="2875" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My main annoyance in this area is that Vivo is using UFS 3.1 storage modules; while I get that the X200 FE doesn't cost as much as its siblings, even mid-range phones are now coming with UFS 4.0, so I don't really understand why the brand didn't use those modules. Thankfully, there's 12GB of RAM as standard, and the 512GB model I'm using comes with 16GB of memory.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4807px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ToZC6RwSbrouPHWRBXvLdQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ToZC6RwSbrouPHWRBXvLdQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4807" height="2708" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The X200 FE gets a 50MP main lens alongside a 50MP 3x tele and 8MP wide-angle, and honestly, it does a fabulous job taking photos. It doesn't measure up to the X200 Pro, but it uses the same main camera as the X200, and while the wide-angle lens isn't quite as good, I didn't have any problems with the other modules.</p><h2 id="it-is-a-battery-beast-2">It is a battery beast</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="NFNHjEfvPKKczHPQsx5BgQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NFNHjEfvPKKczHPQsx5BgQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5134" height="2892" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most small phones don't last as long as traditional flagships, but that is not the case with the X200 FE. Vivo somehow managed to slot in a huge 6,500mAh battery in the phone, and it is even bigger than what you get on the X200 Pro. The result is that the X200 FE lasts two days between charges, and even after pushing the phone, I comfortably got a day and a half.</p><p>Battery anxiety is a thing of the past on Android — unless you're using the S25 Edge. Other than that outlier, any phone should last a day with relative ease, and I didn't have to worry about the battery running out before the end of the day on any of the 50 or so devices I tested this year. If anything, the only device that was problematic in this area is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-air-is-the-coolest-phone-i-used-in-2025">iPhone Air</a>, but that's an entirely different entity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cHtJEu3ZkTHDNuoEzSC8qQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cHtJEu3ZkTHDNuoEzSC8qQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the X200 FE, you don't need to worry about the battery whatsoever. It takes an hour to charge even with the bundled 90W charger, but that's not a problem at all. Just like the other X200 phones, the X200 FE gets a silicon-based battery to achieve a density of 845Wh/L, and it's clear that Vivo and other Chinese brands are using this tech to great effect this year.</p><h2 id="this-is-the-small-phone-you-need-2">This is the small phone you need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5161px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="f3fDTfRRxFfQrRhbwrKLjQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f3fDTfRRxFfQrRhbwrKLjQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5161" height="2907" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you need a small phone that holds its own against regular flagships, I have no problems recommending the X200 FE.

Of course, it isn't anywhere as extreme as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but this just wasn't an issue on the X200 or X200 Pro because of the massive camera modules on those devices.

Vivo somehow managed to slot in a huge 6,500mAh battery in the phone, and it is even bigger than what you get on the X200 Pro. The result is that the X200 FE lasts two days between charges, and even after pushing the phone, I comfortably got a day and a half.</p><p>Battery anxiety is a thing of the past on Android — unless you're using the S25 Edge.

And just like the regular X200 models, the X200 FE gets IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance. Now, I haven't tried shooting jets of hot water at any of these phones with IP69 ingress protection, so I'll have Vivo's word that the phone withstands pressurized jets up to 80 degrees.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5172px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="eVWPomyqUpYpfyEi6bqNfQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eVWPomyqUpYpfyEi6bqNfQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5172" height="2913" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only issue I have with the design is the camera island at the back; the oblong design meshes well with the overall aesthetic, but the island protrudes from the body, and makes the X200 FE wobble quite a bit when using it on a table. Of course, it isn't anywhere as extreme as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but this just wasn't an issue on the X200 or X200 Pro because of the massive camera modules on those devices. Vivo should have retained a similar design at least, albeit a smidgen smaller.</p><h2 id="the-hardware-you-need-2">The hardware you need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4961px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="BCnVJQbaqoYakeEwUnKStQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCnVJQbaqoYakeEwUnKStQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4961" height="2794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo knows what it's doing with the hardware, and there isn't much to talk about in this area. The 6.31-inch AMOLED panel has good color vibrancy and contrast levels, and you get the same level of customization as the other X200 devices. It has the Shield Glass that Vivo has been using for a while instead of Corning's Gorilla Glass solution, and it has proven to be reliable in my usage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pdVp3qFyUusf6B5E7k5VkQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdVp3qFyUusf6B5E7k5VkQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I had the X200 FE for just over two months now, and in that time, the phone took a few tumbles thankfully, it came away unscathed each time. The panel gets 2,160Hz PWM dimming along with the usual 120Hz refresh, and it is fluid — just like other Vivo phones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4939px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="wrMC4i8jG8t6Nc7vUJMseQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wrMC4i8jG8t6Nc7vUJMseQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4939" height="2782" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In short, there are no issues with the smaller-sized panel. It may not have the real estate of the X200 Pro, but it's just as good to play games on, and it gets bright in outdoor use. On that note, the Dimensity 9300+ platform powering the phone is a known quantity, and it does a good job handling visually-demanding games. I would have liked the same Dimensity 9400 as the rest of the X200 range, but the older platform still has a lot to offer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7njJ6okK2ceWpkQcAWsdbQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7njJ6okK2ceWpkQcAWsdbQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5105" height="2875" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My main annoyance in this area is that Vivo is using UFS 3.1 storage modules; while I get that the X200 FE doesn't cost as much as its siblings, even mid-range phones are now coming with UFS 4.0, so I don't really understand why the brand didn't use those modules. Thankfully, there's 12GB of RAM as standard, and the 512GB model I'm using comes with 16GB of memory.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4807px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ToZC6RwSbrouPHWRBXvLdQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ToZC6RwSbrouPHWRBXvLdQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4807" height="2708" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The X200 FE gets a 50MP main lens alongside a 50MP 3x tele and 8MP wide-angle, and honestly, it does a fabulous job taking photos. It doesn't measure up to the X200 Pro, but it uses the same main camera as the X200, and while the wide-angle lens isn't quite as good, I didn't have any problems with the other modules.</p><h2 id="it-is-a-battery-beast-2">It is a battery beast</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="NFNHjEfvPKKczHPQsx5BgQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NFNHjEfvPKKczHPQsx5BgQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5134" height="2892" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most small phones don't last as long as traditional flagships, but that is not the case with the X200 FE. Vivo somehow managed to slot in a huge 6,500mAh battery in the phone, and it is even bigger than what you get on the X200 Pro. The result is that the X200 FE lasts two days between charges, and even after pushing the phone, I comfortably got a day and a half.</p><p>Battery anxiety is a thing of the past on Android — unless you're using the S25 Edge. Other than that outlier, any phone should last a day with relative ease, and I didn't have to worry about the battery running out before the end of the day on any of the 50 or so devices I tested this year. If anything, the only device that was problematic in this area is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-air-is-the-coolest-phone-i-used-in-2025">iPhone Air</a>, but that's an entirely different entity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cHtJEu3ZkTHDNuoEzSC8qQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cHtJEu3ZkTHDNuoEzSC8qQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the X200 FE, you don't need to worry about the battery whatsoever. It takes an hour to charge even with the bundled 90W charger, but that's not a problem at all. Just like the other X200 phones, the X200 FE gets a silicon-based battery to achieve a density of 845Wh/L, and it's clear that Vivo and other Chinese brands are using this tech to great effect this year.</p><h2 id="this-is-the-small-phone-you-need-2">This is the small phone you need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5161px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="f3fDTfRRxFfQrRhbwrKLjQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f3fDTfRRxFfQrRhbwrKLjQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5161" height="2907" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you need a small phone that holds its own against regular flagships, I have no problems recommending the X200 FE.

However, there's a rumor that the overclocked chip could find a home in the Galaxy Z Flip 8 next year. This reportedly comes from a rumor that Samsung is "internally considering" producing the boosted Snapdragon chip within its Foundry for its foldable.</p><p>The publication speculates that this could be due to a potential partnership between TSMC and the Samsung Foundry to get this completed.

But after Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold put the rest of the market on notice, the same can be said about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, but for a completely different reason.</p><p>We've lamented on numerous occasions about how the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> was an eyesore and behind the 8-ball as soon as it arrived. It was awkward, had thick bezels, and a hinge that may or may not have opened all the way. It made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> look futuristic, despite using a design that was already getting a bit long in the tooth.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="DyuViJDrBfrwwH4rMZLJHW" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold-hinges-2" alt="Google Pixel Fold vs. Pixel 10 Pro Fold hinges" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DyuViJDrBfrwwH4rMZLJHW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google then surprised us all with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-one-year-later">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, managing to beat out the rest in the race to become as thin as possible. Fast forward to now, and Google has "recycled" this design for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, skipping the "thin" factor in favor of other specs, such as a larger battery and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 magnetic charging</a>. However, there's another reason why the added thickness doesn't bother me, and it's one we probably don't think about enough.</p><h2 id="where-the-pixel-10-pro-fold-stands-apart-2">Where the Pixel 10 Pro Fold stands apart</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fSdhd6NaRgHxEMHyKeUSoN" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hinge-schematics-design-hero" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold design schematics lifestyle image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fSdhd6NaRgHxEMHyKeUSoN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="676" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's one thing that Google's flagship foldable has over the rest of the competition: an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-waterproof">IP68 rating</a>. Frankly, many wondered if such a rating would ever apply to foldables, given the numerous fail points on a phone with a built-in hinge. Not to mention that Google was the first to achieve this, not Samsung, Oppo, Xiaomi, or any other phone maker.</p><p>In doing so, it provides me (and hopefully everyone else) with a bit more confidence when I get caught in a thunderstorm or take a trip with the family to the beach. No, I'm not saying you should drop the 10 Pro Fold into a bucket of water to test it, but you also won't have to worry quite as much compared to others.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FqjZHrLV5RZGMdaYe8vaDW" name="pixel-10-pro-galaxy-z-fold-7-oppo-find-n5-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 with Oppo Find N5 and Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FqjZHrLV5RZGMdaYe8vaDW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Initially, I didn't really think much about the IP rating, mainly because I'm almost never in a situation that would require me to worry about it. However, funnily enough, that all changed recently when I went to a three-day music festival at the beach.</p><p>Being who I am — a nerd who likes phones and tech — I went to the festival with three different phones. Two were foldables, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> in one front pocket, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a> in the back pocket, and the non-folding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a> in the other front pocket.</p><p>Day one of the concert festival went off without a hitch, but day two was a completely different story</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3Dd8wTxXBUjvGs6XzjpGEP" name="good-charlotte-sum-41-pixel-10-pro-1" alt="Good Charlotte and Sum 41 at concert taken on Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3Dd8wTxXBUjvGs6XzjpGEP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was raining off and on all day, and it got worse after my wife and I arrived. We were there to see a few different bands, but the headliner for night two was Good Charlotte, a band that we both love and haven't had the opportunity to see. The problem was that by the time they came on stage, it felt like we were standing in the outer bands of a hurricane with heavy rain and winds.</p><p>Naturally, when you're someone like me, carrying three phones and seeing bands you listened to religiously growing up, you want to take pictures. Throw in the fact that Good Charlotte had a surprise guest in Deryck Whibley of Sum 41, and it's even more of a reason to record a video or take some pictures.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HKqiVPdfvjMmzaMb7VPxBW" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-pixel-10-pro-galaxy-z-fold-7-oppo-find-n5-1" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold with Galaxy Z Fold 7, Oppo Find N5, and Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HKqiVPdfvjMmzaMb7VPxBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not once did I reach for either the Find N5 or the Z Fold 7 out of fear that the conditions might overwhelm them. Instead, I relied on the Pixel 10 Pro to snap pictures of the band as they played through the hits of my childhood. All the while, jumping around and dancing in a downpour that just so happened to let up as soon as Good Charlotte's time was up.</p><p>That hesitation was enough to make me wish that I had the 10 Pro Fold with me, as I would've felt just as comfortable using that over the other two foldables in my pockets. Not only could I have written about that experience, but I also would've been more likely to leave all of the other phones behind and just carry that one.</p><h2 id="compromises-for-the-sake-of-compromises-2">Compromises for the sake of compromises</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XKsPPcTYiN3ThWNJL3ktFW" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-galaxy-z-fold-7-magic-v5-oppo-find-n5-game-boy" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Honor Magic V5, Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, Oppo Find N5 stacked next to original Game Boy DMG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XKsPPcTYiN3ThWNJL3ktFW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The thing with foldable phones is that they represent the epitome of compromise within the smartphone space. Companies try to cram as much tech as they can into phones that aren't just simple slabs of aluminum and glass, usually to the detriment of one feature or another. It's why the Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn't have the same camera hardware as the 10 Pro XL, despite the former being about $800 less expensive.</p><p>This idea of compromise is also why Samsung ultimately decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-support-the-s-pen">ditch S Pen support</a> with the Fold 7, as the digitizer prevented Samsung from making the phone as thin as it wanted. And while I think there's a prototype out there that looks like the Fold 7 but includes the necessary tech to support the S Pen, I suspect that it'll never see the light of day.</p><p>Honestly, I don't even know if I would care at all about the IP68 rating if it weren't for my concert experience. But if anything, it's made me realize that it's time for Samsung, Motorola, and every other foldable phone maker to get on board. Even if that means that the phone is a few millimeters thicker than the current models.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c0ff7ead-c155-4f70-920a-41130f9bd6f5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHw8obrqbC2rRRZUMSq77i.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold in Jade"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><strong>Don't sleep on it</strong></p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold might not be the thinnest foldable, but Google is relying on other major changes to lead the way, even if they aren't immediately noticeable.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>]]></content:encoded>

And since Google wasted no time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-major-wear-os-6-upgrade-rolls-out-for-the-pixel-watch-3-2">launching the new OS</a> on the Pixel Watch 2 and 3, you can try these perks out for yourself.</p><p>Assuming we don't see any post-launch bugs or rollbacks like with Wear OS 5 and 5.1, then I'll only have one suggestion to improve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> — and one lingering concern about Google's long-term update plans.</p><p>But first, the positives.</p><h2 id="buttery-smooth-animations-2">Buttery smooth animations</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EaPHnRCfooBcNtH78pHgoG" name="Wear-OS-6-scroll" alt="A GIF showing the Pixel Watch 4 app drawer with a finger scrolling it up and down, revealing the "List View" Edge button." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EaPHnRCfooBcNtH78pHgoG.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Scrolling on Wear OS 6 is beautifully smooth. I love the effect of notifications or app drawer icons emerging outward or shrinking away to nothing. The effect is magnified with the Watch 4's domed display, but looks just as dynamic on my flatter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> display.</p><p>Animations like the Edge button emerging from the display edge don't just look cool; there's also a functional benefit to ending a menu with the most logical action, like switching the app drawer to List View if you couldn't find something, or clearing all notifications once you've scrolled through them all.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="bSji5hoyq5rC3R2WdWKaVM" name="Wear-OS-6-scrolling" alt="A Pixel Watch 3 held in hand showing the app drawer; the gif shows the holder scrolling up and down with his thumb, with apps shrinking at the top and bottom of the display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bSji5hoyq5rC3R2WdWKaVM.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new Tiles, too, use Edge buttons for opening full apps if the shortcuts or center info don't do what you need.

A Facer rep <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-6-will-bring-facer-back-onto-android-watches">told me</a> earlier this year that they're hoping Google allows this at some point, among other WFF upgrades like 3D faces.

A look at each individual component helps understand how this magic actually works.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-automatic-speech-recognition"><span>Automatic Speech Recognition</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="zZBYGYUDYxjUDAsazoEpDQ" name="honor-snapdragon-summit-2025-keynote-hero" alt="Honor delivers a keynote speech at Snapdragon Summit 2025 about "ground-breaking" AI for its next phones with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zZBYGYUDYxjUDAsazoEpDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4200" height="2363" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It all starts with a voice. AI acts like a very attentive listener, automatically converting spoken words into digital text.</p><p>This isn't just a simple transcription service; it's a sophisticated system that filters out background noise, adapts to diverse accents, and can even detect very subtle inflections and emphasis on certain words. Imagine a supercharged speech-to-text app like the old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-is-about-to-tap-into-gemini-for-more-reliable-translations">Google Translate</a> that operates in real-time, processing speech in short bursts rather than waiting for you to complete an entire sentence.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-natural-language-processing-neural-machine-translation"><span>Natural Language Processing & Neural Machine Translation</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3106px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.66%;"><img id="uQvKL5SZya4uxpRWsYKRjC" name="ray-ban-meta-display-leak-translate" alt="Ray-Ban Meta Display smart glasses leaked translation feature on its lens-embedded display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQvKL5SZya4uxpRWsYKRjC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3106" height="1760" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screenshot from a leaked Meta YouTube video)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the transcribed text at hand, the system starts a process of deep analysis. It cleans up the text, eliminating filler words ("ums" and "uhs"), adds appropriate punctuation, and, most importantly, <em>interprets</em> <em>the context</em>.</p><p>The system doesn't just engage in a simple word swap; it discerns the actual meaning of a sentence, leveraging the power of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model" target="_blank">Transformer models</a> to capture the nuances of a specific language.</p><p>Once it decides it has everything figured out correctly, it then generates a translation in the target language, striving for both accuracy and naturalness.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-text-to-speech"><span>Text-to-Speech</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="sb2z26UesMdp54R4Z7Yi9g" name="google-maps-text-to-speech-gif.gif" alt="Text-to-speech in Google Maps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sb2z26UesMdp54R4Z7Yi9g.gif" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the translated text is brought to life and transformed back into spoken words.</p><p>Modern AI has made remarkable strides in this area, producing speech that is incredibly natural-sounding, complete with appropriate intonation, rhythm, and even subtle emotional inflections. You probably remember when computer "voices" were robotic and monotone. Today's AI-powered TTS systems specifically strive to emulate the expressiveness of human speech because this actually helps people understand, even though there may be small errors.</p><p>All of this unfolds in a matter of milliseconds, creating what feels like a seamless, conversational experience. This remarkable feat is made possible by deep learning algorithms, constant adaptation, and never-ending research in better contextual understanding.</p><p>But nothing's perfect.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-good-and-bad"><span>The good and bad</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cs966n2AwJNDLpUJE2KoGX" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-XL-live-call-translation-1" alt="Live call translation on the Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cs966n2AwJNDLpUJE2KoGX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most people who have tried AI-powered translation applications or services are simply wowed by them. We love them because it's a cost-effective and convenient way to break the barrier of not understanding what we see or hear around us.</p><p>With the ability to use devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">smartphones</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones" target="_blank">earbuds</a> to understand what we see and hear, this technology is within the reach of almost everyone. This allows us to overlook many of the obvious issues of using AI to translate what one person is saying into what another person is hearing.</p><p>AI struggles with the subtle aspects of human language. All cultures use things like sarcasm or humor, along with specific cultural references that can easily confuse a machine (and sometimes even a human). Phrases like "<em>kick the bucket</em>" or "<em>Skibidi Rizz"</em> simply can't be accurately translated without understanding the meaning and context the speaker had in mind.</p><p>There is also still a perceptible amount of lag. We call it real-time translation, and it is very fast and impressive, but using "chunk detection" to guess when a person is done speaking often leads to awkward pauses or even misinterpretations.</p><p>Finally, there is the issue of bias. AI "learns" from the data it collects, which reflects numerous gender, race, and accent biases. This leads to AI doing things like using male pronouns for a doctor while using female pronouns for a nurse. Other bias issues are more apparent; when most of the data collected comes from males aged 18-40, things can have a specific outlook that ignores many cultural aspects, as well as alternative points of view.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1300px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="56LZiGRL7mdXgFsChVFU67" name="Gemini-replaces-Assitant" alt="Hello Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/56LZiGRL7mdXgFsChVFU67.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1300" height="731" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>AI Translation is not a Human Replacement.</strong> Experts and users alike generally agree that human translators are still needed for important situations such as legal or medical contexts. A machine can't have the same cultural understanding and empathy as a human, either.</p><p>AI translation is best viewed as a powerful tool that <em>augments</em> human capabilities, not replaces them. Even as the science and theory behind it all improve, there are things AI can never be capable of doing as well as real flesh and bone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the video's description box, the user states the Pixel 10 Pro is suffering from an issue within Google's Camera API. The user states they were trying to figure out why their videos always stuttered/jittered when recording, and it seems it's not the camera's fault, but Google's software.</p><p>It's worth noting that these jitters are incredibly noticeable when filming at 5x, and ever-still at 2x. It's no shock that we have micro movements and whatnot when filming or photographing.</p><p>Instead of minimizing those movements, the EIS (electronic image stabilization) is reportedly consistently failing at that zoom range.</p><p>The user couldn't find a solid fix until they downloaded a free app with its own stabilizing capabilities. It is a third-party app, so exercise caution.

One of its biggest advantages over other foldables is IP68 dust and water resistance, made possible by a redesigned hinge mechanism. Google has now explained what went into creating this new hinge.</p><p>The hinge is the most important (and vulnerable) part of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>. It's relatively easy for Android OEMs to make regular smartphones sleeker and more durable since they have no moving parts, but a foldable phone is a different story. Its two halves constantly move, relying on a hinge to keep everything working smoothly.</p><p>Most foldable smartphones use a hinge design with tiny gears inside. However, Sangsoo Park, an industrial designer at Google, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-10-pro-fold-gearless-hinge-design/">explained in a blog post</a> that these gears often cause problems over time. "They can be damaged and dust can get stuck between them," he said, which can lead to a degraded opening and closing experience.</p><p>That's why Google opted for a "gearless hinge" in the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Park noted that typical hinges use four gears to allow the two halves to rotate symmetrically as the device opens and closes, but Google replaced those with a more advanced mechanical component called CAMs. This new approach helped save internal space and improve reliability.</p><h2 id="pixel-10-pro-fold-s-hinge-uses-cams-instead-of-traditional-gears-2">Pixel 10 Pro Fold's hinge uses CAMs instead of traditional gears</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NjKXaA2ajYV3ARhff6rqTD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-impressions-7" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold with Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NjKXaA2ajYV3ARhff6rqTD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google claims this new hinge of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is more reliable and will "continue to work flawlessly over time," which is especially important for a premium device with long-term software support.

The leak claims that the headset weighs only 545 grams.</p><p>Additionally, in the front, the headset will be equipped with sensors under the glass,  that is said to detect gestures and eye movement. "The ones in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners are for hand tracking, and two round sensors at the bottom of the headset, next to the nose cutout, will pick up on your hand gestures."  Another "depth sensor" is located close to the user's forehead, which will supposedly help gauge your surroundings.</p><p>Furthermore, the device could showcase four eye-tracking cameras that use infrared LEDs and AI to track the user's pupils "at all times."  The images show that the headset features two top buttons: a volume control and a "Top button." This launches apps and the UI, or long-pressed, accesses Google Gemini.</p><p>The headset's bottom seems to feature air vents, various sensors (including hand movement), and multiple microphones that will be advanced enough to detect the difference between the user's speech and someone speaking to them.</p><p>The headset will supposedly come with two controllers, with 6 DoF and analog sticks.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of my data is stored on various NAS servers — I have a DiskStation DS1823xs+ and DS1621xs+ — but lately, I've gotten used to having a few external SSDs on hand to move photos and store vital data. External SSDs have gotten much better in recent years, and I prefer using LaCie's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/lacie-rugged-ssd4-4tb-ssd-review">Rugged SSD4</a> at my desk and have the Thunderbolt 5-enabled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/lacie-rugged-pro5-ssd-thunderbolt-5-fastest-ssd-ive-ever-used">Rugged Pro5</a> in the bag if I need additional storage on the go.</p><p>In addition to LaCie's drives, I have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/storage/teamgroup-x1-max-most-versatile-ssd-ever">TeamGroup X1 Max</a>; I used this stick SSD for well over a year now, and its versatile design means it always stays in my tech bag. With USB-C and USB-A connectors, it's just easy to connect it to just about any device. TeamGroup now has a new external SSD dubbed the PD20, and it's designed to look similar to traditional portable SSDs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4TgopfEgfuEb9emyKnXVHh" name="TeamGroup PD20 Mini" alt="TeamGroup PD20 Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4TgopfEgfuEb9emyKnXVHh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It has similar dimensions as Seagate's One Touch SSD, and weighs just 22g — it's small and light enough that you can take it anywhere. It's available in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TEAMGROUP-Portable-Waterproof-Dustproof-TPSEG5001T0C102/dp/B0D48G4T6H">1TB model that costs $95 on Amazon</a>, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TEAMGROUP-Portable-Waterproof-Dustproof-TPSEG5001T0C102/dp/B0D3D1B686">2TB version that's $150</a>. I have the 4TB model, and that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TEAMGROUP-Portable-Waterproof-Dustproof-TPSEG5001T0C102/dp/B0D3D6NR1Z">retails for $277</a>. That's broadly similar to what you'd pay for most portable SSDs, and the advantage with the PD20 is that you get a 2,000MB/s bandwidth — double that of Samsung's T7.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7govZ7b8EwzpZydEBL6WHh" name="TeamGroup PD20 Mini" alt="TeamGroup PD20 Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7govZ7b8EwzpZydEBL6WHh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>TeamGroup also has a generous five-year standard warranty, and I like that about the brand. Okay, let's talk about the SSD itself. The PD20 is designed to be portable, and it fits into a pocket with ease. The hanging hole design means you can attach it to your bag, and the aluminum chassis is designed to be durable. The PD20 gets a pre-installed silicone case as an added source of protection, and it doubles as a cover for the USB-C port.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="L3PYor37J8sWTuTRRSHrEh" name="TeamGroup PD20 Mini" alt="TeamGroup PD20 Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3PYor37J8sWTuTRRSHrEh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The PD20 is clearly built to last; I used it for the better part of four months, and it's pristine. I have no doubt that it will hold up just as well in long-term use as the X1 Max and other external SSDs I have. It gets IP54 dust and water resistance as well (provided the USB-C cover is closed), so it should weather any spills without issues.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p6MEJP9Gvmxy5PCJ6TSqLh" name="TeamGroup PD20 Mini" alt="TeamGroup PD20 Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p6MEJP9Gvmxy5PCJ6TSqLh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A big selling point of the PD20 is that it connects via the USB 3.2 Gen2x2 standard, offering double the bandwidth of most external SSDs. I used Crucial's X10 Pro quite a bit in the last two years, and like the PD20, that drive also uses the same standard, and the only downside is that not all Windows machines can leverage the additional bandwidth.</p><p>TeamGroup touts 2,000MB/s bandwidth, and in my testing, I saw reads of 1,800MB/s and writes of 1,630MB/s, with the drive outmatching the X10 Pro.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Will the Samsung Galaxy S26 support Qi2 magnetic charging?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p><strong>Best answer:</strong> The Samsung Galaxy S26 will most certainly be Qi2-certified just like the S25, but native Qi2 charging support has not been confirmed yet. If Samsung does add native Qi2 support, there's a possibility of losing the reverse wireless charging feature, like with the Pixel 10 series.</p></article></section><h2 id="is-not-having-native-qi2-charging-on-the-galaxy-s26-a-deal-breaker-2">Is not having native Qi2 charging on the Galaxy S26 a deal-breaker?</h2><p>Magnetic wireless charging using the Qi2 standard on Android phones has gotten trendy only this year, thanks to a lot of hype drummed up by companies like Samsung and Google. This is essentially the same tech that Apple introduced back in 2020 with the launch of the iPhone 12 series. Of course, charging speeds have gotten better since it debuted, but not all Qi2 phones are built the same.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Samsung Galaxy S26</a> will most certainly support Qi2 charging, just like the S25 series, but we don't know if this implementation will be native. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Galaxy S25 supports the Qi 2.1.0 standard</a> that lets it charge up to 15W wirelessly, but magnetic charging is only possible with a case. It's only the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/wpc-announces-qi2-25w-major-android-devices-certification-new-standard">Qi 2.2 standard</a> or Qi 25W that allows for a maximum charging rate of 25W. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> is the only phone in the series to support this, while the rest of the Pixel 10 series support the older Qi 2.0 standard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4026px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-11" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus with a case on and an ESR Qi2 charger attached to the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4026" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An early release Google Pixel 10 Pro XL case with a Qi2 magnet array inside.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's too early to tell what Qi2 standard will be used in the Galaxy S26; we can only hope it's the latest one that allows for much faster charging. Whether the magnets will be built in or not is still anyone's guess, but given the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">Pixel 10's support for magnetic charging</a>, it seems likely.

While the rumored design of the Galaxy Trifold is briefly seen in the patent, the real revelation is that Samsung could utilize three batteries, not two. The Dutch publication notes that the patent mentions a battery called "360," which is simply a moniker.</p><p>However, that singular "battery" is actually broken up into three parts in the leaked patents.</p><p>The patent suggests Samsung will place a battery that contains a portion of the phone's overall capacity in each panel. These are broken down into battery numbers 361 (T1), 362 (T2), and 363 (T3). Per the leaked document, T1 seems to be the smallest battery, as Samsung could have that inside the rear panel, right under the vertical camera array.</p><p>For T2, that battery is shown in the center of the main display when opened. It seems that T2 is the largest of them, as T3, placed in the cover display, is between them all in size.

Craning your neck down at a 6-inch rectangle simply doesn't fit any definition of the term. But one game developer is hell-bent on turning that little black rectangle into a portal that defies expectations.</p><p>Waltz of the Wizard might not be a name you're familiar with unless you own a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> (or an older headset). It's a classic VR title that's been around for a long time but has seen regular updates over the years, often injecting impressive levels of innovation into a seemingly simple formula.</p><p>The game has enjoyed a huge revival over the last year thanks to social media, and developer Aldin Dynamics is launching the first mobile version <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waltz-of-the-wizard/id6742191553">on iOS</a> at the end of this month. Yes, I know, it's more than a bummer that it's not available on Android yet, but it's still an impressive way to take a VR game and make it available for a significantly larger audience of gamers to try.</p><h2 id="bash-some-skullies-2">Bash some Skullies</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt6iFWRfoWQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>After toying around with the game for quite a while, I knew I had to chat with the developers to find out how they ported a VR game so successfully to a mobile platform. After all, Waltz of the Wizard deeply relies on both physical and voice immersion to drive the experience, but it turns out the pace of the game allows this to translate to mobile quite seamlessly.</p><p>Hrafn Thorisson, the co-founder and CEO of Aldin Dynamics, told me the company has always been about "making realities that make you feel like this isn't a game." For Aldin, this means adding a "high degree of interactivity to characters, thousands of reactions for them," and, maybe most notably, "speaking to them verbally by using your voice."</p><p>That last part is something not often seen in the world of smartphone gaming, unless we're talking about having a chat between friends on Discord while simultaneously playing a game. Waltz of the Wizard almost completely revolves around a disembodied human skull named Skully, whom you talk to constantly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mc2JAjpynFRNZBza7GffaQ" name="waltz-of-the-wizard-official-screenshot-03" alt="An official screenshot of Waltz of the Wizard for mobile showing Skully being held over a wizard's pot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mc2JAjpynFRNZBza7GffaQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Aldin Dynamics)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether it's asking about the properties of an object in the world and what you can do with it, or even asking Skully to conjure up some magic to create items, this sarcastic, borderline rude skull is the key to Waltz of the Wizard's unique personality as a game.</p><p>Unlike some other VR games that have started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/stellar-cafe-job-simulator-hands-on">experimenting with LLM robots</a> to create unique dialogue, Waltz of the Wizard uses a more "classic AI model," as Thorisson puts it. Skully is built to react to things in a specific, hand-hewn way that has required developers thousands of hours to build, complete with a fully-voiced personality.</p><p>Thorisson says Skully is "the most interactive character you'll have on mobile now," with "thousands of thousands of reactions" for you to find. Whether that means bashing him against the wall a few times or feeding him some weird potion you just concocted is entirely up to you.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7sjAcqf9weu863UjZW3mXk" name="waltz-of-the-wizard-mixed-reality-gameplay" alt="Dropping an eyeball into a pot using mixed reality mode on an iPhone in Waltz of the Wizard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7sjAcqf9weu863UjZW3mXk.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Translating the interactivity component of the VR classic to a mobile touchscreen interface was a better fit than a traditional console. "In some ways, we're able to do things with a mobile device that we can't do with a console, where the standard is to have buttons and joysticks." Plus, being able to utilize the natural "drag and drop" nature of a touchscreen meant the interaction paradigm fit better on a phone than a console.</p><p>Phones also have the added advantage of a front-facing camera and built-in microphones, which allow Skully to not only hear you, but also see you making facial expressions. Make an angry face or wink at him, and he'll probably notice.</p><p>Furthermore, Aldin Dynamics is utilizing the rear camera on the phone in a way I've ever seen before: using your physical hand to interact with the virtual world.

These rumors have continued, as a more recent report claims <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-automatic-call-screen-samsung-phones">Samsung is working on a Call Screening</a> feature, similar to Google's Pixel. This is AI-fueled, and could automatically "answer, transcribe, and filter spam or unknown calls for users." There was another report that purported Samsung was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/amid-one-ui-8-5-leaks-alleged-galaxy-buds-4-pro-testing-begins-rumor">also beginning testing</a> for a Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, too.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Coming from a Motorola Razr, it was novel to use a phone with a 3.5-inch touchscreen and a built-in app store. Following the 3GS, I switched over to Android (I got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-nexus-4-review">Nexus 4</a>), but I started using iPhones again a few years later — as my secondary phone — starting with the iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p>These days, I get to use every mainstream phone that launches globally (and a few that don't). Over 80 phones cross my desk in any given year, and I got to use the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> this year.</p><p>Out of all those devices, it's the iPhone Air that stood out the most. It isn't the most innovative phone I used — that honor goes to the tri-folding Mate XT — but the ultra-sleek design of the Air is just plain cool. Photos don't really do this thing justice; you'll need to hold it in your hand to understand just how thin and light it is.</p><h2 id="you-ll-need-to-hold-it-to-believe-it-2">You'll need to hold it to believe it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="oh498WrgHimCA2ZHTFGGSR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oh498WrgHimCA2ZHTFGGSR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5149" height="2900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've had the iPhone Air for ten days now, and it's become one of my favorite phones of 2025. In fact, I don't think there was any other iPhone in the last 15 years that evoked such strong feelings. The iPhone Air isn't unique in being an ultra-thin device — Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge also catering to a similar niche. But the iPhone Air is even thinner, and it just feels better to hold and use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DzBUqeYCoEFgdtTaNxGVQR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DzBUqeYCoEFgdtTaNxGVQR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Design is obviously the biggest selling point of the Air, and the phone has a great in-hand feel.

Most Android phones like the Vivo X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro last a day and a half even with heavy use thanks to 6,000mAh batteries, but even the iPhone 17 Pro manages to last a day consistently. However, the thinner size of the iPhone Air precludes it from doing so, and if you're a heavy user like me, you will be plugging it in before the end of the day.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="GMC65pyRhP6nhCdqdigLUR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GMC65pyRhP6nhCdqdigLUR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another consideration is the camera; the iPhone Air has a single 48MP camera at the back, and it takes good photos and videos. It may not be at the same level as Android flagships, but it delivers images with good colors and dynamic range, and it holds its own in low-light situations. The problems is the lack of auxiliary cameras; I use the 2x and 3x lenses regularly, and I often rely on these modules to shoot portrait shots. Not having the ability to do that on the Air is limiting.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="jywgAtGNT9FP42ovs3T8dR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jywgAtGNT9FP42ovs3T8dR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, the front 18MP camera is the same as the iPhone 17 Pro, and it is fantastic. It uses a square module and switches orientation on the fly, so if you end up taking a lot of selfies, there's a lot to like here. The software is similarly identical to the Pro models, and I like the new visual design.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-for-everyone-and-that-s-okay-2">It's not for everyone— and that's okay</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Ug94ZK8FKYyyEaSpBPojUR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ug94ZK8FKYyyEaSpBPojUR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, the iPhone Air isn't meant for everyone. There are always going to be tradeoffs in a new product line, and with the iPhone Air, those include a single camera and average battery life. I've been carrying an iPhone alongside my Android phone for several years now, so the fact that the iPhone Air doesn't last as long doesn't bother me anywhere as much.</p><p>But if you're eyeing this as an upgrade to your existing iPhone, you'll need to factor in the downsides before purchasing it. If you routinely take photos and videos and need added versatility, you should just get the iPhone 17 Pro.

Coming from a Motorola Razr, it was novel to use a phone with a 3.5-inch touchscreen and a built-in app store. Following the 3GS, I switched over to Android (I got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-nexus-4-review">Nexus 4</a>), but I started using iPhones again a few years later — as my secondary phone — starting with the iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p>These days, I get to use every mainstream phone that launches globally (and a few that don't). Over 80 phones cross my desk in any given year, and I got to use the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> this year.</p><p>Out of all those devices, it's the iPhone Air that stood out the most. It isn't the most innovative phone I used — that honor goes to the tri-folding Mate XT — but the ultra-sleek design of the Air is just plain cool. Photos don't really do this thing justice; you'll need to hold it in your hand to understand just how thin and light it is.</p><h2 id="you-ll-need-to-hold-it-to-believe-it-2">You'll need to hold it to believe it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="oh498WrgHimCA2ZHTFGGSR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oh498WrgHimCA2ZHTFGGSR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5149" height="2900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've had the iPhone Air for ten days now, and it's become one of my favorite phones of 2025. In fact, I don't think there was any other iPhone in the last 15 years that evoked such strong feelings. The iPhone Air isn't unique in being an ultra-thin device — Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge also catering to a similar niche. But the iPhone Air is even thinner, and it just feels better to hold and use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DzBUqeYCoEFgdtTaNxGVQR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DzBUqeYCoEFgdtTaNxGVQR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Design is obviously the biggest selling point of the Air, and the phone has a great in-hand feel.

Coming from a Motorola Razr, it was novel to use a phone with a 3.5-inch touchscreen and a built-in app store. Following the 3GS, I switched over to Android (I got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-nexus-4-review">Nexus 4</a>), but I started using iPhones again a few years later — as my secondary phone — starting with the iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p>These days, I get to use every mainstream phone that launches globally (and a few that don't). Over 80 phones cross my desk in any given year, and I got to use the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> this year.</p><p>Out of all those devices, it's the iPhone Air that stood out the most. It isn't the most innovative phone I used — that honor goes to the tri-folding Mate XT — but the ultra-sleek design of the Air is just plain cool. Photos don't really do this thing justice; you'll need to hold it in your hand to understand just how thin and light it is.</p><h2 id="you-ll-need-to-hold-it-to-believe-it-2">You'll need to hold it to believe it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="oh498WrgHimCA2ZHTFGGSR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oh498WrgHimCA2ZHTFGGSR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5149" height="2900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've had the iPhone Air for ten days now, and it's become one of my favorite phones of 2025. In fact, I don't think there was any other iPhone in the last 15 years that evoked such strong feelings. The iPhone Air isn't unique in being an ultra-thin device — Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge also catering to a similar niche. But the iPhone Air is even thinner, and it just feels better to hold and use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DzBUqeYCoEFgdtTaNxGVQR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DzBUqeYCoEFgdtTaNxGVQR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Design is obviously the biggest selling point of the Air, and the phone has a great in-hand feel. The frosted glass finish at the back also makes a difference in this regard, and you get the same set of buttons as the iPhone 17 Pro. The phone isn't anywhere as fragile as I initially imagined, and that should bode well for long-term use. While the iPhone 17 Pro switched over to aluminum, the Air retains a titanium chassis.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5058px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="9EraZVsBAFxTDdzJjw6yMR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9EraZVsBAFxTDdzJjw6yMR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5058" height="2849" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="NrytMs7DPPTayGkvuG75PR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrytMs7DPPTayGkvuG75PR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Ai6JBACguMAUdH6KG8s3TR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ai6JBACguMAUdH6KG8s3TR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x2wipy7e2FW9rABhyFeMHR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x2wipy7e2FW9rABhyFeMHR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The iPhone Air has a 6.5-inch OLED screen with LTPO tech, and it is the exact same panel used in the iPhone 17 Pro, albeit a little bigger. You get the same great color vibrancy and excellent contrast, and it holds up incredibly well under harsh sunlight thanks to the anti-reflective coating. It has ProMotion tech, so you get 120Hz refresh as standard, with the panel going down to 1Hz with static content.</p><h2 id="pro-grade-internals-2">Pro-grade internals</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uYLcyfvV7UfdT9KGCLFaTR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uYLcyfvV7UfdT9KGCLFaTR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You don't miss out on the internals either, with the iPhone Air coming with the latest A19 Pro silicon. The situation with the modem is interesting; Apple is using the C1X modem — a derivative of the C1 that debuted on the iPhone 16e — in the device, and it handles 5G connectivity alongside Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6.0. The iPhone Air differs from the Pro models in this regard, with those devices using the N1 chip along with a Qualcomm cellular modem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="dbU8ynJ2xEsxNF5zNtRCWR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbU8ynJ2xEsxNF5zNtRCWR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another point of differentiation is that the iPhone Air is only available with eSIM — there's no model with a physical SIM card slot. Apple says it did this to maximize internal storage for the battery, and honestly, it isn't as limiting as I thought. I have a secondary number that I ported over to an eSIM, and it has been smooth setting it up on the Air.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LkdaW4f9PU5SiQebpdpjUR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LkdaW4f9PU5SiQebpdpjUR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On that note, we need to talk about the battery.

While both amps share a similar design, the Amp Ultra is bigger and heavier, and the inclusion of the screen is a welcome addition. What I like the most about WiiM's products is how straightforward they are to set up and use, and this is the same with the Amp Ultra as well — you'll just need to connect the amp to a wall outlet, and use the WiiM Home app to configure it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="88dgPqzTi3KVqQNZk5fJdL" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/88dgPqzTi3KVqQNZk5fJdL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like all WiiM products, the build quality of the Amp Ultra is terrific; it has a minimalist design with belies its price tag, and the aluminum construction is decidedly high-end. It does a good job with heat management as well, and there's a rotary knob at the front to control the volume.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mEuck5WWdr7HXkMEuPYbVL" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mEuck5WWdr7HXkMEuPYbVL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I generally like the design of all WiiM products, but the Amp Ultra looks more upmarket than its siblings. It's clear that WiiM paid a lot of attention to the design, and it's safe to say that there are few amps that look as good — particularly in this category.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5ZtqmqEw5sPoHrhEgVj9FL" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5ZtqmqEw5sPoHrhEgVj9FL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The built-in 3.5-inch panel makes it easy to control music playback and view album art, and WiiM bundles its new Voice Remote 2 with the product, which is what I used to predominantly control the Amp Ultra in the two months I used it. I paired the Amp Ultra with Wharfedale's Linton, and the amp is easily able to drive the speakers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2Gg3gKGVCZLNpAyuCYprEL" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Gg3gKGVCZLNpAyuCYprEL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the hardware, the Amp Ultra has an ESS 9039Q2M Sabre DAC along with TI OPA1612 op-amps and two TI TPA3255 amps. It delivers 192kHz/24-bit audio, and connects to just about every streaming protocol you can think of: Chromecast Audio, Spotify Connect, Tidal Connect, DLNA, and Roon Ready. It's the Roon integration that I like the most; I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/roon-has-transformed-how-i-listen-to-music">use Roon to play music</a> on all the connected devices in my house, and it's a fabulous platform. Being able to access it on the device makes it all the more convenient.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="i3XJTX2WuJEBxAWKfLkk9L" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i3XJTX2WuJEBxAWKfLkk9L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On that note, WiiM Home has a clean interface, ties into all mainstream music services, and has plenty of customizability along with granular 10-band EQ control. What I like is that you get the ability to adjust EQ individually for each source mode, which is pretty great. You can do everything from adjusting the brightness of the built-in panel, which clock faces to use, standby time, adjust settings of a connected subwoofer, and so much more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5j2eYrquQvVqtHhzr4VNcL" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5j2eYrquQvVqtHhzr4VNcL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to connectivity, you get the standard gold-plated binding posts that let you hook up speakers, and there's a dedicated subwoofer out. The inputs include optical and RCA, along with HDMI ARC; this is another reason why I used the Amp Ultra, as HDMI ARC allows me to connect the amp to my TV.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="TGw7bFw2bg4kG8Aey9DUyK" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TGw7bFw2bg4kG8Aey9DUyK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can use two WiiM amps to set up a Dolby 5.1 system, and while I'm using it just with the Linton, I'm eager to use a home theater configuration in this way. Elsewhere, there's Bluetooth 5.3 (to pair with the remote), Wi-Fi 6, and an Ethernet port. The bundled remote has all the buttons I need (including a dedicated mute button), and like the amp, it has a metallic design. It connects over Bluetooth, charges via USB-C, and has four programmable preset buttons. The only quibble I have with it is that the buttons aren't backlit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ygXjfF8cnGnNdBBioRfnPL" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ygXjfF8cnGnNdBBioRfnPL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With 100W a channel at 8Ω and 200W at 4Ω, the amp has more than enough power to drive demanding speakers. It's able to drive the Linton with ease, and the sound quality is phenomenal. Granted, I'm just getting started with home audio, so I don't have much in the way of a reference point, but I'll be picking up Denon's AVR-X3800H shortly, and I'll test how WiiM's offering holds up against that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rWBmpMgKiTw2fEmUmYXGxK" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rWBmpMgKiTw2fEmUmYXGxK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another feature the Amp Ultra gets is automatic room correction. The brand's RoomFit feature does a great job tuning the acoustics based on the size of your room, and it worked very well with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>. If anything, the only feature missing on the amp is AirPlay 2, it's unclear why it isn't available, but it isn't as big a limitation in my own use.</p><p>Outside of that, the Amp Ultra has proven to be a standout streaming amplifier, and it manages to look good while doing it.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="477a580a-90f6-46a7-857d-dddbe5c42f37">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Streaming-Amplifier-ES9039Q2M-Touchscreen/dp/B0F995W2NG" data-model-name="WiiM Amp Ultra" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:62.50%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AV3gCpyJv2F2WpKdVDJS7i.jpg' alt="WiiM Amp Ultra"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">WiiM Amp Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Amp Ultra has enough power to drive demanding audio gear, and it has unmatched connectivity.

You get similar software perks to the pricier Fenix 8, most notably offline maps for hiking and golf, where the Venu 4 falls short.

The 45mm model is closer, and you can buy a nylon strap to try to close the weight gap a bit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8190px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RdEHDac7U4xw7fhTFhBetR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-workout-activity-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on an athlete's wrist, showing a Run activity start screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RdEHDac7U4xw7fhTFhBetR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8190" height="4607" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that makes the Venu 4 heavier is the stainless steel built into both the bezel and the case, giving it a classy look. The Venu 4 45mm is slightly thicker than its predecessor at 12.5mm, and looks bulky compared to the Venu X1, but it's skinnier than most other Garmin watches. It's all relative, in other words.</p><p>The Venu X1 has a titanium caseback and buttons that add some shine, but the body itself is mostly made of polymer, keeping it light. Its skinniness and textured lines around its edge make the Venu X1 look less "cheap" and sportier than thicker, polymer-case Garmin watches, however.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="eKy3YsTFL9sqaVKkkwrWiM" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-golfing-2" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on a wrist next to a golf glove, showing the yardage for the hole with fairway rough in the background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eKy3YsTFL9sqaVKkkwrWiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's the 2-inch display that's the real Venu X1 standout. It may not have the Venu 4's accessibility features, but the display leaves room to expand widgets and increase text size, so it's cumulatively much more readable. Maps, in particular, look fantastic on the X1, making it fun to use while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/ive-returned-to-golf-after-15-years-and-my-garmin-venu-x1-has-been-a-huge-help">on the golf course</a> and hiking.</p><p>The other X1 advantage is that it uses sapphire glass for the best scratch protection, while the Venu 4 sticks to Gorilla Glass 3. It's a telltale example of Garmin preventing its "mid-range" watches from getting the best features, even though almost any other $500+ watch has sapphire glass or its equivalent.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-venu-x1-hardware-sensors-battery-life-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. Venu X1: Hardware, sensors, & battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-flashlight-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 at night with the flashlight on and pointing at the camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin doesn't advertise processors, but the Venu 4 and X1 have comparable speed in our testing. Likewise, the mic, speakers, flashlight, connectivity standards, and sensors are mostly the same, along with the same five global navigation satellite systems (GNSS).</p><p>The first difference is that the Venu 4 offers the same dual-band (L1 + L5 signal) GPS as other top Garmin watches, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=wgKpMjTlpV29AQB5PVvTL9">SatIQ</a> mode, which defaults to GPS-only to save battery but switches to better system(s) if the signal is disrupted. The Venu X1 may be the only Garmin watch this expensive to stick to All-Systems GNSS, likely due to limited space and battery life; it still does quite well for accuracy, but the Venu 4 is a better fit if you often work out in urban canyons or mountain forest regions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="kDFVYm2E9SoCSDxecEgPcd" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-glances-battery" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on the author's wrist, showing the current battery percentage (49%) and time left (1 day) in AOD mode, along with glances for Weather and Sunset below." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kDFVYm2E9SoCSDxecEgPcd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Next, the Venu 4 offers ECGs to detect atrial fibrillation issues, while the Venu X1 does not. Again, this has to do with the X1's unique design, as Garmin's ECG solution relies on a metal ring and a button design that it was too thin (and square) to accommodate. Keep in mind that no Garmin watches have passive irregular heart rhythm detection; you have to actively check.</p><p>The third key difference, of course, is battery life. Depending on whether you choose the Venu 4 41mm or 45mm, it'll last 2 or 4 days longer than the Venu X1, or 1 or 2 days more with AOD. In terms of workouts, the 45mm Venu 4 is rated to last four hours longer in All-Systems mode, while the 41mm Venu is rated for one hour less.</p><p>The gap isn't as wide as it might have been, as the Venu 3 lasts longer than the Venu 4; the 2,000-nit display boost cuts into its capacity. Still, even if the Venu 4 isn't as long-lived as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, it's closer to the Garmin standard you're used to.</p><h2

It's an unconventional design for Garmin, but you might be surprised how much you'll love how light it is and how it makes the dense Garmin UI easier to read, both during and after workouts.</p><p>Neither watch is especially affordable, but the Venu 4 is still the better all-around pick if you don't need maps, while the Venu X1 is the ritzy pick for someone willing to pay extra for niche perks and fantastic comfort.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="509dcf34-f733-4baa-a8e9-0984d6a4b35b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3egxn4mWgBFBcAPJYaZ6uC.jpg' alt="Render of the black 45mm Garmin Venu 4, the display showing Lifestyle logging menu with options like Late Caffeine and Alcohol."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Garmin Venu 4</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Garmin's best mid-ranger</strong></em></p><p>Choose the Garmin Venu 4 for a well-rounded software experience with Forerunner tools restricted from the Venu 3, with new perks like a flashlight and Fitness Coach mixed in with old favorites like ECGs and a mic & speaker.

The 45mm model is closer, and you can buy a nylon strap to try to close the weight gap a bit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8190px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RdEHDac7U4xw7fhTFhBetR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-workout-activity-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on an athlete's wrist, showing a Run activity start screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RdEHDac7U4xw7fhTFhBetR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8190" height="4607" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that makes the Venu 4 heavier is the stainless steel built into both the bezel and the case, giving it a classy look. The Venu 4 45mm is slightly thicker than its predecessor at 12.5mm, and looks bulky compared to the Venu X1, but it's skinnier than most other Garmin watches. It's all relative, in other words.</p><p>The Venu X1 has a titanium caseback and buttons that add some shine, but the body itself is mostly made of polymer, keeping it light. Its skinniness and textured lines around its edge make the Venu X1 look less "cheap" and sportier than thicker, polymer-case Garmin watches, however.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="eKy3YsTFL9sqaVKkkwrWiM" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-golfing-2" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on a wrist next to a golf glove, showing the yardage for the hole with fairway rough in the background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eKy3YsTFL9sqaVKkkwrWiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's the 2-inch display that's the real Venu X1 standout. It may not have the Venu 4's accessibility features, but the display leaves room to expand widgets and increase text size, so it's cumulatively much more readable. Maps, in particular, look fantastic on the X1, making it fun to use while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/ive-returned-to-golf-after-15-years-and-my-garmin-venu-x1-has-been-a-huge-help">on the golf course</a> and hiking.</p><p>The other X1 advantage is that it uses sapphire glass for the best scratch protection, while the Venu 4 sticks to Gorilla Glass 3. It's a telltale example of Garmin preventing its "mid-range" watches from getting the best features, even though almost any other $500+ watch has sapphire glass or its equivalent.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-venu-x1-hardware-sensors-battery-life-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. Venu X1: Hardware, sensors, & battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-flashlight-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 at night with the flashlight on and pointing at the camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin doesn't advertise processors, but the Venu 4 and X1 have comparable speed in our testing. Likewise, the mic, speakers, flashlight, connectivity standards, and sensors are mostly the same, along with the same five global navigation satellite systems (GNSS).</p><p>The first difference is that the Venu 4 offers the same dual-band (L1 + L5 signal) GPS as other top Garmin watches, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=wgKpMjTlpV29AQB5PVvTL9">SatIQ</a> mode, which defaults to GPS-only to save battery but switches to better system(s) if the signal is disrupted. The Venu X1 may be the only Garmin watch this expensive to stick to All-Systems GNSS, likely due to limited space and battery life; it still does quite well for accuracy, but the Venu 4 is a better fit if you often work out in urban canyons or mountain forest regions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="kDFVYm2E9SoCSDxecEgPcd" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-glances-battery" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on the author's wrist, showing the current battery percentage (49%) and time left (1 day) in AOD mode, along with glances for Weather and Sunset below." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kDFVYm2E9SoCSDxecEgPcd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Next, the Venu 4 offers ECGs to detect atrial fibrillation issues, while the Venu X1 does not. Again, this has to do with the X1's unique design, as Garmin's ECG solution relies on a metal ring and a button design that it was too thin (and square) to accommodate. Keep in mind that no Garmin watches have passive irregular heart rhythm detection; you have to actively check.</p><p>The third key difference, of course, is battery life. Depending on whether you choose the Venu 4 41mm or 45mm, it'll last 2 or 4 days longer than the Venu X1, or 1 or 2 days more with AOD. In terms of workouts, the 45mm Venu 4 is rated to last four hours longer in All-Systems mode, while the 41mm Venu is rated for one hour less.</p><p>The gap isn't as wide as it might have been, as the Venu 3 lasts longer than the Venu 4; the 2,000-nit display boost cuts into its capacity.

The 45mm model is closer, and you can buy a nylon strap to try to close the weight gap a bit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8190px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RdEHDac7U4xw7fhTFhBetR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-workout-activity-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on an athlete's wrist, showing a Run activity start screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RdEHDac7U4xw7fhTFhBetR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8190" height="4607" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that makes the Venu 4 heavier is the stainless steel built into both the bezel and the case, giving it a classy look. The Venu 4 45mm is slightly thicker than its predecessor at 12.5mm, and looks bulky compared to the Venu X1, but it's skinnier than most other Garmin watches. It's all relative, in other words.</p><p>The Venu X1 has a titanium caseback and buttons that add some shine, but the body itself is mostly made of polymer, keeping it light. Its skinniness and textured lines around its edge make the Venu X1 look less "cheap" and sportier than thicker, polymer-case Garmin watches, however.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="eKy3YsTFL9sqaVKkkwrWiM" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-golfing-2" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on a wrist next to a golf glove, showing the yardage for the hole with fairway rough in the background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eKy3YsTFL9sqaVKkkwrWiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's the 2-inch display that's the real Venu X1 standout. It may not have the Venu 4's accessibility features, but the display leaves room to expand widgets and increase text size, so it's cumulatively much more readable. Maps, in particular, look fantastic on the X1, making it fun to use while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/ive-returned-to-golf-after-15-years-and-my-garmin-venu-x1-has-been-a-huge-help">on the golf course</a> and hiking.</p><p>The other X1 advantage is that it uses sapphire glass for the best scratch protection, while the Venu 4 sticks to Gorilla Glass 3. It's a telltale example of Garmin preventing its "mid-range" watches from getting the best features, even though almost any other $500+ watch has sapphire glass or its equivalent.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-venu-x1-hardware-sensors-battery-life-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. Venu X1: Hardware, sensors, & battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-flashlight-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 at night with the flashlight on and pointing at the camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin doesn't advertise processors, but the Venu 4 and X1 have comparable speed in our testing. Likewise, the mic, speakers, flashlight, connectivity standards, and sensors are mostly the same, along with the same five global navigation satellite systems (GNSS).</p><p>The first difference is that the Venu 4 offers the same dual-band (L1 + L5 signal) GPS as other top Garmin watches, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=wgKpMjTlpV29AQB5PVvTL9">SatIQ</a> mode, which defaults to GPS-only to save battery but switches to better system(s) if the signal is disrupted. The Venu X1 may be the only Garmin watch this expensive to stick to All-Systems GNSS, likely due to limited space and battery life; it still does quite well for accuracy, but the Venu 4 is a better fit if you often work out in urban canyons or mountain forest regions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="kDFVYm2E9SoCSDxecEgPcd" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-glances-battery" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on the author's wrist, showing the current battery percentage (49%) and time left (1 day) in AOD mode, along with glances for Weather and Sunset below." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kDFVYm2E9SoCSDxecEgPcd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Next, the Venu 4 offers ECGs to detect atrial fibrillation issues, while the Venu X1 does not. Again, this has to do with the X1's unique design, as Garmin's ECG solution relies on a metal ring and a button design that it was too thin (and square) to accommodate. Keep in mind that no Garmin watches have passive irregular heart rhythm detection; you have to actively check.</p><p>The third key difference, of course, is battery life. Depending on whether you choose the Venu 4 41mm or 45mm, it'll last 2 or 4 days longer than the Venu X1, or 1 or 2 days more with AOD. In terms of workouts, the 45mm Venu 4 is rated to last four hours longer in All-Systems mode, while the 41mm Venu is rated for one hour less.</p><p>The gap isn't as wide as it might have been, as the Venu 3 lasts longer than the Venu 4; the 2,000-nit display boost cuts into its capacity. Still, even if the Venu 4 isn't as long-lived as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, it's closer to the Garmin standard you're used to.</p><h2

It's an unconventional design for Garmin, but you might be surprised how much you'll love how light it is and how it makes the dense Garmin UI easier to read, both during and after workouts.</p><p>Neither watch is especially affordable, but the Venu 4 is still the better all-around pick if you don't need maps, while the Venu X1 is the ritzy pick for someone willing to pay extra for niche perks and fantastic comfort.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="509dcf34-f733-4baa-a8e9-0984d6a4b35b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3egxn4mWgBFBcAPJYaZ6uC.jpg' alt="Render of the black 45mm Garmin Venu 4, the display showing Lifestyle logging menu with options like Late Caffeine and Alcohol."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Garmin Venu 4</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Garmin's best mid-ranger</strong></em></p><p>Choose the Garmin Venu 4 for a well-rounded software experience with Forerunner tools restricted from the Venu 3, with new perks like a flashlight and Fitness Coach mixed in with old favorites like ECGs and a mic & speaker.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Treblab is another in a long line of Chinese audio brands catering to the value category, and the HD-360 Pro stands out from the rest thanks to its ability to deliver 360-degree sound. With five drivers in total and eight passive radiators, this thing produces a <em>loud </em>sound with wall-rattling bass, and it's built like a tank.</p><p>The HD-360 Pro usually costs $159, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-High-Performance-Radiators-Subwoofer-Bluetooth/dp/B0D4DMNWK4">it's down to $127 for Prime Day</a>, making it an even better bargain.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5c7fb784-7416-4f68-a32d-cabf59cfee62" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The HD-360 Pro sounds great, delivers 360-degree sound with a powerful bass, and the metallic chassis is built to be durable.

The sound quality is quite good, and the bass in particular is vibrant. You're getting a good overall value as well.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong> You want easy-to-use controls. The touch-based controls on the HD-360 Pro are annoying to use. It isn't easily portable, so you'll need to account that in.</p><p>Most Bluetooth speakers have a plastic chassis, but the HD-360 Pro uses an aluminum body with a fabric layer and plastic up top. As such, it is considerably heavier than most other 360-degree speakers, coming in at 5lb. The lack of a carrying handle makes things harder when it comes to portability; I just carried it around by holding the slots around the radiators.</p><p>The only other issue is the controls at the top; instead of physical controls, Treblab went with a touch alternative, and it just as isn't as straightforward. Most of the time, I had to press the play/pause button a few times to trigger the action.</p><p>Other than that, I didn't have any issues with the HD-360 Pro. You're buying this for the sound quality, and that's where it excels. It delivers up to 90W of sound, and the 360-degree orientation of the drivers along with the radiators leads to a booming sound that belies its size. It is a bit bass-heavy, but not so much that it bleeds into the rest of the frequencies.</p><p>Battery life is good too, and I got over 16 hours of use without any issues. It has IPX4 ingress protection, and it connected to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> over Bluetooth 5.0 with ease. The main reason for choosing the HD-360 Pro over other options is the value, and with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-High-Performance-Radiators-Subwoofer-Bluetooth/dp/B0D4DMNWK4">deal bringing it down to $127</a>, it's a good choice if you're looking to get a new speaker.</p><h2
