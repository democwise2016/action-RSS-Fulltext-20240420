      <![CDATA[<p>'Tis basically the season for Samsung phone deals, even ahead of some of the biggest sales events of the year.

For that reason, it landed a spot as our favorite premium foldable phone upon its release, and in no small part due to its huge, good-looking 8-inch AMOLED display. Compared to older models of the Z Fold, which kind of felt like a heavy remote control when folded, the Z Fold 7 includes an even larger and wider cover screen, a more subtle crease, and just an overall sleeker build that we love.</p><p>This particular deal is for the upgraded 512GB version of the phone, though there's also a slightly more affordable 256GB version if you don't need that much storage.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$2,119.99" data-dimension48="$2,119.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7J243YH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.93%;"><img id="RDNwNL995uXSRoo2iwFPsc" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RDNwNL995uXSRoo2iwFPsc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1499" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (512GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7J243YH" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$2,119.99" data-dimension48="$2,119.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$2,119.99</del> <strong>$1,719.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has dropped to its lowest price ever at Amazon, marking a 19% discount and bringing it to $1,720. While that's still a hefty price tag, even for a foldable phone, you definitely get what you pay for here with an impressively powerful phone that's landed our top spot in the premium foldable category<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7J243YH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$2,119.99" data-dimension48="$2,119.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a performance-intensive foldable phone with all the bells and whistles; you like having crisp, clear cameras for video- and photo-taking; clarity and vibrance of a phone's display are both important metrics for you when it comes to buying a foldable phone.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want a Samsung phone that's compatible with the first-party S Pen; you're looking for a phone that's under $1,000 and you don't mind downgrading some hardware; you need something with industry-leading battery life and you'd be willing to avoid a power-intensive foldable phone.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone#section-best-premium-foldable">best premium foldable phone </a>out there, sporting a massive 8-inch, 120Hz foldable screen, an improved feel from past generations when using it folded, and hyper-powered performance backed by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy CPU. It also comes with 12GB of RAM, ultrawide, telephoto, and wide-angle camera lenses, and a range of powerful Galaxy AI features.</p><p>It's probably not the best battery life out there, especially because of the massive, power-intensive screen, but we've been able to make it last for more than a day when not using the screen super often. Beyond that, it also has 25W wired charging and 15W wireless, and while there are faster charging phones out there, this will get the job done for most casual users.</p><p>Perhaps the phone's biggest downsides are simply its price tag—which is slightly better with this deal—and its lack of support for the Samsung S Pen.</p>]]>

Some players will simply choose one over the other based on either convenience or their own strengths. If anything, playing it on a Steam Deck made it feel more chill, while the VR version felt far more active and chaotic, effectively highlighting the strengths of both systems.</p><p>The full early access period begins on October 21 and is fully free to play. A fairly standard skin shop is set up for players to purchase unique skins if they want, although in-game currency ensures that you will be able to earn skins and plenty of other fun cosmetic prizes without having to bankroll your character.</p><p>Check out the demo now and give it a shot! I was thoroughly impressed with how much fun it was, and the unique movement concepts make it feel substantially different in a flooded market of games that too often feel the same.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f0c771de-8ee2-4f25-8b85-5eca87309e59">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCUPHg8DY6xth6JoYMuDGK.jpg' alt="An official product render of the Meta Quest 3S with its controllers"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Meta Quest 3S</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Whether you love social environments, puzzle game, multiplayer shooters, or just checking out the next evolution of technology, the Meta Quest 3s has it all at a lower price than you imagined.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>]]>

Everyone is suited up to jump out, and just as the bay doors open, a brown backpack is thrown out that looks <em>a lot</em> like a parachute. Unfortunately, you don't have time to wonder if the thing on your back is a real parachute or a fake, because the plane has already ejected everyone, and you're now free-falling at 10,000ft in the air.</p><p>Knowing what's likely going to happen, it's pretty clear to you that <em>you're</em> not going to be the one landing without a parachute. For the next several minutes, all eight of you battle it out in the clouds, using your arm-mounted rockets and grappling hooks to catch other players and keep the backpack until the end.</p><p>The game is Project Freefall, and its unique nature isn't just the gameplay; it's also the fact that you can play on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">a Meta Quest headset</a>, a Steam Deck, or any of the other non-VR platforms the game supports, all flying together in a fairly rare cross-platform quest to reach the bottom.</p><h2 id="battle-royale-against-the-clock-2">Battle royale against the clock</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pj4BEJ7JLx8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Developer Schell Games has long made some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>. The veteran VR studio is behind well-known games like I Expect You to Die, Among Us VR, Silent Slayer: Vault of the Vampire, Until You Fall, and many more. While Among Us VR eventually became <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/among-us-3d-proves-non-vr-crossplay-should-be-future-of-quest-games">Among Us 3D</a> with crossplay support between VR and non-VR systems, Project Freefall is designed for crossplay from day one.</p><p>The game launched in "earliest access" this week during Steam Next Fest, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/project-freefall/7932952873476077">a demo on the Meta Quest</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3592440/Project_Freefall/">a demo on Steam</a> that you can download right now. Since the game is multiplayer only, I recommend visiting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.com/invite/schellgames">Schell Games' Discord server</a> and joining any one of the active sessions posted there.</p><p>Project Freefall is simple enough in concept, but certainly one of those games that'll become increasingly complex as players master the unique movement systems. As you're falling through the air, you not only have those arm-mounted thrusters, but each hand has an independent grappling hook that can be used to grab items or pull yourself toward obstacles.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:384px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="Lda2yT9irLmT3rWuYYQNRb" name="freefall-steam-deck" alt="Playing Project Freefall on a Steam Deck" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lda2yT9irLmT3rWuYYQNRb.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="384" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Why are there giant Ninja Warrior-esque obstacles falling through the air while you skydive? It's a video game that's not afraid to be a video game, that's why! Any number of objects can fall, from giant shark statues to literal Ninja Warrior-style obstacle courses that you can pull yourself through to avoid being tagged.</p><p>Grabbing the backpack is as easy as simply running into the player wearing it, from whence you'll immediately boost away wearing the coveted prize. Schell Games told me this small boost was introduced in early testing to help avoid the pitfalls of backpack juggling, giving players a brief moment to collect themselves before being chased.</p><p>Along with those giant obstacles that help make movement more complex in an otherwise empty sky, you'll find a smattering of power-ups and items that help you achieve the goal of holding the backpack the longest.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="2ZRrnkRm3xnBVgFb3CqkGg" name="freefall-vr" alt="Playing Project Freefall on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ZRrnkRm3xnBVgFb3CqkGg.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether it's a paint grenade to blind your opponents, Mario Kart style, or a bat that you can smack them with and stun them, these items are all about increasing the competitive nature of the game.</p><p>And that brings me to the unique qualities of playing on each supported platform. VR players will find that they have a distinct movement advantage, as they can easily aim each of their arms in different directions or even blind fire toward an obstacle while faking movement toward another.

At first glance, the Pixel 10 Pro is a bit unassuming, as it essentially looks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, just with some new colors. But that couldn't be further from the truth once you start using the phone, as there are at least twelve new AI-powered features on board.</p><p>As one would expect, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> powers all of these new features in some way, whether that be via the cloud or actually on the device. Some of these features are Magic Cue, Daily Hub, and Edit with Ask Photos, but as noted in our review, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-cue-on-the-pixel-10">Magic Cue</a> is really the standout here.</p><p>That's because it's essentially an assistant you don't have to invoke to get help. Instead, you'll notice new icons or buttons appearing when someone texts you about dinner plans, or if you get an email confirming an upcoming flight. It's early days, but Magic Cue feels like we're getting closer to the true meaning of a "digital assistant."</p><p>But, as previously mentioned, this is just one of the many Gemini-powered features that are currently exclusive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>. And what better way to get a taste of the future than with the latest and greatest phone that Google has to offer?</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-upgrade-pick"><span>Best upgrade pick</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ekn2mwwza3B283LYzRd7n6" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-galaxy-ai" alt="The Galaxy AI welcome screen on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra running One UI 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ekn2mwwza3B283LYzRd7n6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">2.

And in recent years, that has extended to an ever-growing number of AI features found in every nook and cranny. No, it's not mainly Bixby doing the work here, but instead, it's a combination of Samsung's own AI efforts paired with Google Gemini.</p><p>One of the coolest features of the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the ability to perform multiple actions with a single command. You can watch a YouTube video about basically anything, activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>, ask it to summarize the video, and have the results saved in Samsung Notes. The same is true when creating calendar events or adding details to an existing one. While it might seem trivial, these features can really come in handy.</p><p>There are also features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a>, which I previously dubbed "Google Now reincarnated." Now Brief provides summaries throughout your day, highlighting calendar events, the weather, and even news headlines from topics you're interested in. These "Briefs" are delivered periodically, and thanks to the power of the onboard AI, are great for providing reminders or giving you an idea of what the next day will bring.</p><p>Of course, there are even more AI-powered features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Audio Eraser</a>, which removes background and unnecessary noise from a video with just the tap of a button. Not only that, but you can adjust the "EQ" levels, allowing you to make sure that whoever is talking is crystal clear.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CEt23rop3TvzQAxu2EPv3j" name="Samsung Galaxy A56" alt="Samsung Galaxy A56 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CEt23rop3TvzQAxu2EPv3j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-samsung-galaxy-a56-5g-2"><span class="title__text">3.

There's even "Read Aloud" in the Samsung Internet app, which takes the text from an article and converts it to audio so you can listen instead of reading.</p><p>However, the Galaxy A56 is also chock-full of AI-enhanced photography and videography tools. Things like Object Eraser and Edit Suggestion help you get rid of those people in the background while adding a bit of bokeh effect to an image in no time. Then, there's Auto Trim that analyzes videos you've recorded and chops them up into smaller "highlight videos" to share.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-foldable"><span>Best foldable</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZfCGygu5TJxaB6yZYyXT3D" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-21" alt="Moto AI contextual option on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZfCGygu5TJxaB6yZYyXT3D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="4-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">4.

Some of these, such as Circle to Search and Magic Editor, are already staples across many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>.</p><p>But Motorola took things a step further with Image Studio for image generation and Playlist Studio for delivering generated music playlists. Not to mention that the Razr Ultra features a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-ultra-ai-key-misses-the-mark-google-and-samsung-should-do-it-better">dedicated AI Key</a> that invokes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> without needing to do anything but long-press a button.</p><p>The AI Key isn't the only unique AI feature of the Razr Ultra, as this is also the first time we've seen Perplexity partner with a smartphone company. As a result of the partnership <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">announced in April 2025</a>, Perplexity is pre-installed, and you'll get three months of Perplexity Pro for free. This comes with a few different benefits, such as Deep Research and access to a variety of AI models.</p><p>While that might not seem like a big deal, considering that most phones "only" include access to Gemini or a company's own AI features, it gives the Razr Ultra an edge over the rest. And while the implementation might not be as robust as Gemini, Perplexity has been integrated into Moto AI and offers much more than just operating as a replacement for Google.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-iphone"><span>Best iPhone</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="aPUMbpp4CGemyVe7qTANfi" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPUMbpp4CGemyVe7qTANfi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5068" height="2855" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="5-apple-iphone-17-pro-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">5.

The iPhone is all you get when you're in the Apple ecosystem, but that also means that you might think you're just stuck with Siri for your "AI digital assistant." Despite the fact that Siri is still living in the Stone Age, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pokes-fun-at-apples-iphone-17-ai-capabilities">Apple Intelligence</a> on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max offers a better experience than you might think.</p><p>Much of this is made possible through various partnerships that Apple has made in an effort to fill the massive gap between Siri and Gemini or Amazon Alexa. For instance, OpenAI's ChatGPT is deeply integrated into iOS, allowing you to get more accurate results compared to relying solely on Siri.</p><p>Visual Intelligence is essentially Google's Circle to Search, just wrapped in Apple's divisive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">Liquid Glass UI</a>. Just take a screenshot, highlight something on the screen, and get the answers that you need, all with a few taps.</p><p>While an argument can be made that you can just do the same things by downloading the ChatGPT and Google apps, technically, that's true. However, these features are integrated into Apple Intelligence and iOS, as opposed to needing to download the specific apps to get similar functionality.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-alternative"><span>Best alternative</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qXVPuW8d5wCXbLf6u7V3gd" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-01" alt="The back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13 on a wooden tea tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qXVPuW8d5wCXbLf6u7V3gd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="6-oneplus-13-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">6.

Don't fret, as the OnePlus 13 is here and even garnered a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">perfect 5-star rating</a> from AC's own Nick Sutrich. It doesn't just offer a great overall experience, but OnePlus AI provides access to an abundance of AI features that you might not have known you needed.</p><p>The biggest example of this is with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">OnePlus Mind Space</a>, which consolidates important pictures, videos, events, and more into one app. Then, anything you add to Mind Space will appear whenever using the built-in AI search functionality, with the OnePlus 13 analyzing the query and providing relevant results and answers.</p><p>More recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-unveils-two-new-ai-features-as-part-of-its-ai-playlab-launch" target="_blank">AI PlayLab</a> was introduced, with OnePlus hoping to get feedback from its customers about potential upcoming AI features that are currently in development. The first two features included were YumSee and Party Up, with the former providing an AI translation of restaurant menus, and the latter being able to edit a picture and turn it into "live party-themed videos."</p><p>All the while, the OnePlus 13 still offers one of the best smartphone experiences to date. Which we expect will continue once its successor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a>, is finally introduced and released.</p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><h2 id="what-s-the-best-ai-phone-2">What's the best AI phone?</h2><p>Deciding between these options when choosing the best AI phone wasn't as easy as you might think. However, the easiest decision was to place the Pixel 10 Pro at the top, as it offers the most complete Gemini AI experience available. And when you consider that basically every other phone on this list integrates Gemini in some way, it makes the Pixel 10 Pro a no-brainer. Really, the only argument is whether the larger screen of the Pixel 10 Pro XL is better.</p><p>Beyond that, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is another obvious inclusion, as Samsung continues to implement its own spin on AI features. As such, it delivers a more robust package across the board when compared to the Pixel 10 Pro or even the OnePlus 13. Plus, the S25 Ultra spent most of 2025 as the best overall phone for many, and we suspect that its successor will quickly take over the reins.</p><p>However, it's important to point out that not all of the best AI features are natively built into these phones. There are countless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/best-android-ai-apps">AI apps</a> on the Play Store that can be quickly downloaded and make a lasting impact, all without needing to spend hundreds of dollars (or more). Sure, they're not going to be implemented at a system level, but that doesn't mean they should be ignored, either.</p><ul><li><strong>More phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>]]>

At first glance, the Pixel 10 Pro is a bit unassuming, as it essentially looks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, just with some new colors. But that couldn't be further from the truth once you start using the phone, as there are at least twelve new AI-powered features on board.</p><p>As one would expect, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> powers all of these new features in some way, whether that be via the cloud or actually on the device. Some of these features are Magic Cue, Daily Hub, and Edit with Ask Photos, but as noted in our review, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-cue-on-the-pixel-10">Magic Cue</a> is really the standout here.</p><p>That's because it's essentially an assistant you don't have to invoke to get help. Instead, you'll notice new icons or buttons appearing when someone texts you about dinner plans, or if you get an email confirming an upcoming flight. It's early days, but Magic Cue feels like we're getting closer to the true meaning of a "digital assistant."</p><p>But, as previously mentioned, this is just one of the many Gemini-powered features that are currently exclusive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>. And what better way to get a taste of the future than with the latest and greatest phone that Google has to offer?</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-upgrade-pick"><span>Best upgrade pick</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ekn2mwwza3B283LYzRd7n6" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-galaxy-ai" alt="The Galaxy AI welcome screen on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra running One UI 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ekn2mwwza3B283LYzRd7n6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">2.

And in recent years, that has extended to an ever-growing number of AI features found in every nook and cranny. No, it's not mainly Bixby doing the work here, but instead, it's a combination of Samsung's own AI efforts paired with Google Gemini.</p><p>One of the coolest features of the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the ability to perform multiple actions with a single command. You can watch a YouTube video about basically anything, activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>, ask it to summarize the video, and have the results saved in Samsung Notes. The same is true when creating calendar events or adding details to an existing one. While it might seem trivial, these features can really come in handy.</p><p>There are also features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a>, which I previously dubbed "Google Now reincarnated." Now Brief provides summaries throughout your day, highlighting calendar events, the weather, and even news headlines from topics you're interested in. These "Briefs" are delivered periodically, and thanks to the power of the onboard AI, are great for providing reminders or giving you an idea of what the next day will bring.</p><p>Of course, there are even more AI-powered features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Audio Eraser</a>, which removes background and unnecessary noise from a video with just the tap of a button. Not only that, but you can adjust the "EQ" levels, allowing you to make sure that whoever is talking is crystal clear.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CEt23rop3TvzQAxu2EPv3j" name="Samsung Galaxy A56" alt="Samsung Galaxy A56 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CEt23rop3TvzQAxu2EPv3j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-samsung-galaxy-a56-5g-2"><span class="title__text">3.

There's even "Read Aloud" in the Samsung Internet app, which takes the text from an article and converts it to audio so you can listen instead of reading.</p><p>However, the Galaxy A56 is also chock-full of AI-enhanced photography and videography tools. Things like Object Eraser and Edit Suggestion help you get rid of those people in the background while adding a bit of bokeh effect to an image in no time. Then, there's Auto Trim that analyzes videos you've recorded and chops them up into smaller "highlight videos" to share.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-foldable"><span>Best foldable</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZfCGygu5TJxaB6yZYyXT3D" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-21" alt="Moto AI contextual option on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZfCGygu5TJxaB6yZYyXT3D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="4-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">4.

Some of these, such as Circle to Search and Magic Editor, are already staples across many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>.</p><p>But Motorola took things a step further with Image Studio for image generation and Playlist Studio for delivering generated music playlists. Not to mention that the Razr Ultra features a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-ultra-ai-key-misses-the-mark-google-and-samsung-should-do-it-better">dedicated AI Key</a> that invokes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> without needing to do anything but long-press a button.</p><p>The AI Key isn't the only unique AI feature of the Razr Ultra, as this is also the first time we've seen Perplexity partner with a smartphone company. As a result of the partnership <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">announced in April 2025</a>, Perplexity is pre-installed, and you'll get three months of Perplexity Pro for free. This comes with a few different benefits, such as Deep Research and access to a variety of AI models.</p><p>While that might not seem like a big deal, considering that most phones "only" include access to Gemini or a company's own AI features, it gives the Razr Ultra an edge over the rest. And while the implementation might not be as robust as Gemini, Perplexity has been integrated into Moto AI and offers much more than just operating as a replacement for Google.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-iphone"><span>Best iPhone</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="aPUMbpp4CGemyVe7qTANfi" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPUMbpp4CGemyVe7qTANfi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5068" height="2855" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="5-apple-iphone-17-pro-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">5.

The iPhone is all you get when you're in the Apple ecosystem, but that also means that you might think you're just stuck with Siri for your "AI digital assistant." Despite the fact that Siri is still living in the Stone Age, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pokes-fun-at-apples-iphone-17-ai-capabilities">Apple Intelligence</a> on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max offers a better experience than you might think.</p><p>Much of this is made possible through various partnerships that Apple has made in an effort to fill the massive gap between Siri and Gemini or Amazon Alexa. For instance, OpenAI's ChatGPT is deeply integrated into iOS, allowing you to get more accurate results compared to relying solely on Siri.</p><p>Visual Intelligence is essentially Google's Circle to Search, just wrapped in Apple's divisive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">Liquid Glass UI</a>.

Don't fret, as the OnePlus 13 is here and even garnered a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">perfect 5-star rating</a> from AC's own Nick Sutrich. It doesn't just offer a great overall experience, but OnePlus AI provides access to an abundance of AI features that you might not have known you needed.</p><p>The biggest example of this is with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">OnePlus Mind Space</a>, which consolidates important pictures, videos, events, and more into one app. Then, anything you add to Mind Space will appear whenever using the built-in AI search functionality, with the OnePlus 13 analyzing the query and providing relevant results and answers.</p><p>More recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-unveils-two-new-ai-features-as-part-of-its-ai-playlab-launch" target="_blank">AI PlayLab</a> was introduced, with OnePlus hoping to get feedback from its customers about potential upcoming AI features that are currently in development. The first two features included were YumSee and Party Up, with the former providing an AI translation of restaurant menus, and the latter being able to edit a picture and turn it into "live party-themed videos."</p><p>All the while, the OnePlus 13 still offers one of the best smartphone experiences to date. Which we expect will continue once its successor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a>, is finally introduced and released.</p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><h2 id="what-s-the-best-ai-phone-2">What's the best AI phone?</h2><p>Deciding between these options when choosing the best AI phone wasn't as easy as you might think. However, the easiest decision was to place the Pixel 10 Pro at the top, as it offers the most complete Gemini AI experience available. And when you consider that basically every other phone on this list integrates Gemini in some way, it makes the Pixel 10 Pro a no-brainer. Really, the only argument is whether the larger screen of the Pixel 10 Pro XL is better.</p><p>Beyond that, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is another obvious inclusion, as Samsung continues to implement its own spin on AI features. As such, it delivers a more robust package across the board when compared to the Pixel 10 Pro or even the OnePlus 13. Plus, the S25 Ultra spent most of 2025 as the best overall phone for many, and we suspect that its successor will quickly take over the reins.</p><p>However, it's important to point out that not all of the best AI features are natively built into these phones. There are countless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/best-android-ai-apps">AI apps</a> on the Play Store that can be quickly downloaded and make a lasting impact, all without needing to spend hundreds of dollars (or more). Sure, they're not going to be implemented at a system level, but that doesn't mean they should be ignored, either.</p><ul><li><strong>More phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>]]>

At first glance, the Pixel 10 Pro is a bit unassuming, as it essentially looks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, just with some new colors. But that couldn't be further from the truth once you start using the phone, as there are at least twelve new AI-powered features on board.</p><p>As one would expect, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> powers all of these new features in some way, whether that be via the cloud or actually on the device. Some of these features are Magic Cue, Daily Hub, and Edit with Ask Photos, but as noted in our review, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-cue-on-the-pixel-10">Magic Cue</a> is really the standout here.</p><p>That's because it's essentially an assistant you don't have to invoke to get help. Instead, you'll notice new icons or buttons appearing when someone texts you about dinner plans, or if you get an email confirming an upcoming flight. It's early days, but Magic Cue feels like we're getting closer to the true meaning of a "digital assistant."</p><p>But, as previously mentioned, this is just one of the many Gemini-powered features that are currently exclusive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>. And what better way to get a taste of the future than with the latest and greatest phone that Google has to offer?</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-upgrade-pick"><span>Best upgrade pick</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ekn2mwwza3B283LYzRd7n6" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-galaxy-ai" alt="The Galaxy AI welcome screen on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra running One UI 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ekn2mwwza3B283LYzRd7n6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">2.

And in recent years, that has extended to an ever-growing number of AI features found in every nook and cranny. No, it's not mainly Bixby doing the work here, but instead, it's a combination of Samsung's own AI efforts paired with Google Gemini.</p><p>One of the coolest features of the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the ability to perform multiple actions with a single command. You can watch a YouTube video about basically anything, activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>, ask it to summarize the video, and have the results saved in Samsung Notes. The same is true when creating calendar events or adding details to an existing one. While it might seem trivial, these features can really come in handy.</p><p>There are also features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a>, which I previously dubbed "Google Now reincarnated." Now Brief provides summaries throughout your day, highlighting calendar events, the weather, and even news headlines from topics you're interested in. These "Briefs" are delivered periodically, and thanks to the power of the onboard AI, are great for providing reminders or giving you an idea of what the next day will bring.</p><p>Of course, there are even more AI-powered features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Audio Eraser</a>, which removes background and unnecessary noise from a video with just the tap of a button. Not only that, but you can adjust the "EQ" levels, allowing you to make sure that whoever is talking is crystal clear.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CEt23rop3TvzQAxu2EPv3j" name="Samsung Galaxy A56" alt="Samsung Galaxy A56 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CEt23rop3TvzQAxu2EPv3j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-samsung-galaxy-a56-5g-2"><span class="title__text">3.

There's even "Read Aloud" in the Samsung Internet app, which takes the text from an article and converts it to audio so you can listen instead of reading.</p><p>However, the Galaxy A56 is also chock-full of AI-enhanced photography and videography tools. Things like Object Eraser and Edit Suggestion help you get rid of those people in the background while adding a bit of bokeh effect to an image in no time. Then, there's Auto Trim that analyzes videos you've recorded and chops them up into smaller "highlight videos" to share.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-foldable"><span>Best foldable</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZfCGygu5TJxaB6yZYyXT3D" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-21" alt="Moto AI contextual option on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZfCGygu5TJxaB6yZYyXT3D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="4-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">4.

Some of these, such as Circle to Search and Magic Editor, are already staples across many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>.</p><p>But Motorola took things a step further with Image Studio for image generation and Playlist Studio for delivering generated music playlists. Not to mention that the Razr Ultra features a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-ultra-ai-key-misses-the-mark-google-and-samsung-should-do-it-better">dedicated AI Key</a> that invokes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> without needing to do anything but long-press a button.</p><p>The AI Key isn't the only unique AI feature of the Razr Ultra, as this is also the first time we've seen Perplexity partner with a smartphone company. As a result of the partnership <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">announced in April 2025</a>, Perplexity is pre-installed, and you'll get three months of Perplexity Pro for free. This comes with a few different benefits, such as Deep Research and access to a variety of AI models.</p><p>While that might not seem like a big deal, considering that most phones "only" include access to Gemini or a company's own AI features, it gives the Razr Ultra an edge over the rest. And while the implementation might not be as robust as Gemini, Perplexity has been integrated into Moto AI and offers much more than just operating as a replacement for Google.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-iphone"><span>Best iPhone</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="aPUMbpp4CGemyVe7qTANfi" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPUMbpp4CGemyVe7qTANfi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5068" height="2855" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="5-apple-iphone-17-pro-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">5.

The iPhone is all you get when you're in the Apple ecosystem, but that also means that you might think you're just stuck with Siri for your "AI digital assistant." Despite the fact that Siri is still living in the Stone Age, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pokes-fun-at-apples-iphone-17-ai-capabilities">Apple Intelligence</a> on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max offers a better experience than you might think.</p><p>Much of this is made possible through various partnerships that Apple has made in an effort to fill the massive gap between Siri and Gemini or Amazon Alexa. For instance, OpenAI's ChatGPT is deeply integrated into iOS, allowing you to get more accurate results compared to relying solely on Siri.</p><p>Visual Intelligence is essentially Google's Circle to Search, just wrapped in Apple's divisive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">Liquid Glass UI</a>. Just take a screenshot, highlight something on the screen, and get the answers that you need, all with a few taps.</p><p>While an argument can be made that you can just do the same things by downloading the ChatGPT and Google apps, technically, that's true. However, these features are integrated into Apple Intelligence and iOS, as opposed to needing to download the specific apps to get similar functionality.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-alternative"><span>Best alternative</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qXVPuW8d5wCXbLf6u7V3gd" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-01" alt="The back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13 on a wooden tea tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qXVPuW8d5wCXbLf6u7V3gd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="6-oneplus-13-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">6.

Don't fret, as the OnePlus 13 is here and even garnered a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">perfect 5-star rating</a> from AC's own Nick Sutrich. It doesn't just offer a great overall experience, but OnePlus AI provides access to an abundance of AI features that you might not have known you needed.</p><p>The biggest example of this is with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">OnePlus Mind Space</a>, which consolidates important pictures, videos, events, and more into one app. Then, anything you add to Mind Space will appear whenever using the built-in AI search functionality, with the OnePlus 13 analyzing the query and providing relevant results and answers.</p><p>More recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-unveils-two-new-ai-features-as-part-of-its-ai-playlab-launch" target="_blank">AI PlayLab</a> was introduced, with OnePlus hoping to get feedback from its customers about potential upcoming AI features that are currently in development. The first two features included were YumSee and Party Up, with the former providing an AI translation of restaurant menus, and the latter being able to edit a picture and turn it into "live party-themed videos."</p><p>All the while, the OnePlus 13 still offers one of the best smartphone experiences to date. Which we expect will continue once its successor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a>, is finally introduced and released.</p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><h2 id="what-s-the-best-ai-phone-2">What's the best AI phone?</h2><p>Deciding between these options when choosing the best AI phone wasn't as easy as you might think. However, the easiest decision was to place the Pixel 10 Pro at the top, as it offers the most complete Gemini AI experience available. And when you consider that basically every other phone on this list integrates Gemini in some way, it makes the Pixel 10 Pro a no-brainer. Really, the only argument is whether the larger screen of the Pixel 10 Pro XL is better.</p><p>Beyond that, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is another obvious inclusion, as Samsung continues to implement its own spin on AI features. As such, it delivers a more robust package across the board when compared to the Pixel 10 Pro or even the OnePlus 13. Plus, the S25 Ultra spent most of 2025 as the best overall phone for many, and we suspect that its successor will quickly take over the reins.</p><p>However, it's important to point out that not all of the best AI features are natively built into these phones. There are countless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/best-android-ai-apps">AI apps</a> on the Play Store that can be quickly downloaded and make a lasting impact, all without needing to spend hundreds of dollars (or more). Sure, they're not going to be implemented at a system level, but that doesn't mean they should be ignored, either.</p><ul><li><strong>More phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

Everything we'd seen officially from the company looked like it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygen-os-16-looks-a-lot-like-ios-teasers-confirm-its-launch">just ripping off iOS</a>, and I don't know about you, but that's <em>not</em> why I use a OnePlus phone.</p><p>Thankfully, what we'd been seeing are just new <em>options</em> that users can enable if they want. Like the split notification shade OnePlus introduced last year, this year's OxygenOS 16 offers users plenty of UI customization options and focuses intensely on the beautification of the entire experience.</p><p>That ranges from new lockscreen options, new animations, smoother performance, an updated theme engine, AI-powered photography options that are designed to make the camera even better than before, and plenty more! I've spent several days with OxygenOS 16 on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and came away super impressed with what's in store for users as it starts rolling out globally today.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-themes-and-lockscreen"><span>Themes and lockscreen</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xTpYmem4pAJRxPYNWEMhYk" name="oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-lockscreen-chickens" alt="A custom lockscreen with chickens created on a OnePlus 13 using OxygenOS 16's new options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xTpYmem4pAJRxPYNWEMhYk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first thing you're sure to notice is how much of a glow-up the theme engine and, by proxy, the lockscreen have received. When I first booted up the OxygenOS 16 update, I was greeted by a majestic mountain wallpaper complete with gorgeous new moving wallpaper effects and incredible depth.</p><p>OnePlus answered the call for users to customize the text on the lockscreen, so no more settling for just "Never Settle" or some other random word like "fast," as you had to in OxygenOS 15. Not only that, but you can select any <em>motion photo</em> taken with the camera and apply it to the lockscreen, complete with depth effects and movement. It's <strong>gorgeous</strong> and creates a whole new style you're going to spend hours tweaking.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-notification-shade-and-homescreen"><span>Notification shade and homescreen</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sqJueFzERhyzvJV5JrarBW" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-notifications" alt="The new notification shade design in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sqJueFzERhyzvJV5JrarBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The lockscreen isn't the only thing getting a glow-up! Both the homescreen and notification shade have received some excellent tweaks. App icons are now prominently displayed on the left side of each notification, including an easy-to-see number for nofication groups.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8RpwSWPCBgCX5ZgNAvbaBd" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-homescreen-widgets-02" alt="The new widget corner design in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8RpwSWPCBgCX5ZgNAvbaBd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Homescreen icons can now be stretched to fit larger spaces. If you have just one icon and want to fill a gap, it'll turn into a lovely little colored button. Likewise, widgets now have a more rounded shape, giving them a more uniform appearance, but you can disable it if you don't like the new style.</p><p>The app drawer got a nice redesign too, adding a new categorical view you can swipe between that auto-categorizes apps into folders. I still prefer the alphabetized drawer, and the redesigned alphabetical scrolling wheel on the right now singles out each letter's apps instead of just scrolling through the drawer, helping to better isolate apps that start with each letter.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-animations"><span>Animations</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="D2zLBoMhYKTunQtxc2X5hR" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-lockscreen-animation" alt="The new lockscreen animations and customization options in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D2zLBoMhYKTunQtxc2X5hR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus made a big deal of animations in OxygenOS 15, and the company is doubling down with Parallel Processing 2.0, which allows new animations to begin before other ones have even finished. That ensures that fun animations complement each other instead of canceling out.</p><p>One of my favorite new animations is seeing apps slide outward when using the back gesture. You can play around with this by heading to system navigation in system settings, then enabling <strong>swipe animations</strong>. It's very fun and helps complete the feeling of a cohesive, fluid OS!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-better-portraits"><span>Better portraits</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s5qydXLjnWFWnUc2bknakZ" name="oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-perfect-shot" alt="Using OxygenOS 16's Perfect Shot feature to select another expression for a boy in a photo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s5qydXLjnWFWnUc2bknakZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've found that the OnePlus 13 often takes excellent portrait photos, but there are a few times when I hope for better results. OxygenOS 16 adds a ton of new portrait enhancement features, including much-needed post-processing options that let you adjust the amount of blur and lighting on foreground objects and people.</p><p>You can edit any photo taken previously, so these new features work on both new and existing photos. Speaking of older photos, people who have a vast catalog of photos on their OnePlus phones will find the new Perfect Shot feature to be a godsend. Tapping Perfect Shot will scan your gallery (assuming you gave it permission) for similar faces, then offer alternative expressions based on that person's other pictures.</p><p>It's similar to Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a> feature, but it doesn't just work on photos taken in a single group burst. This is the <em>perfect</em> solution for those of us with teenagers or pre-teens who never seem to want to smile, as you can pretty easily swap out that angsty stare with a nice smile if you've got a few sitting in your gallery. It feels like magic!</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-mind-space"><span>Mind Space</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PZXr3PzafMr7GowoVSXZwQ" name="oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-plus-mind-summary" alt="Looking through a summary of gym notes stored in Plus Mind in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZXr3PzafMr7GowoVSXZwQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus may have launched Mind Space with the middling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13S</a> a few months ago, but this is the first time I'm getting to use it on my standard OnePlus 13. While I'm hoping OnePlus adds a few more ways to quickly get to Mind Space on phones without a dedicated side key, it's easy enough to three-finger swipe down to capture anything and send it to Mind Space on this phone.</p><p>Accessing it via a quick icon on the homescreen is also fine enough, but it's what's inside that I'm really loving. Ever since Nothing launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/how-use-nothing-essential-space">Essential Space</a> with the Nothing Phone 3a series back in the Spring, other Android OEMs have been adding a similar feature that works even better than Nothing's design. Like Essential Space, OnePlus's Mind Space app is a central repository for all your note-taking and screenshot-searching needs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G8N7NZvUuScCzXQbtKwc9W" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-mind-space-gemini" alt="Integrating Mind Space on the OnePlus 13 with Google Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G8N7NZvUuScCzXQbtKwc9W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The key difference here is that, while things are easily searchable on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9" target="_blank">Pixel Screenshots app</a> for Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 phones, Mind Space is the <em>first</em> app of its kind to directly integrate into Gemini. That means you don't even have to open the app to start a search. Just ask Gemini and it'll organize everything for you!</p><p>Mind Space is also very handy for summarizing or organizing information, and can even create charts and visuals based on information you store in it. This is awesome for me, as I often take notes for briefings or interviews and then have to comb through them later to organize them. Mind Space was able to take one of these documents and turn it into a visual flow chart, giving me a quick way to organize all my thoughts.</p><p>My next request for OnePlus is to allow it to store longer documents and make importing documents to Mind Space easier than just sharing what's on screen.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-voice-recorder-upgrades"><span>Voice recorder upgrades</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3DdMDQxgQEzDJb9ivrrVPh" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-voice-recorder-transcription" alt="The new voice recorder transcription upgrades in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3DdMDQxgQEzDJb9ivrrVPh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Voice Recorder got a <strong>massive</strong> upgrade in OxygenOS 16. While the previous version was fine enough, it lacked some of the more impressive AI-based features like automatic transcription and speaker identification. All that is here now, and it works beautifully.</p><p>You can even go back and transcribe previous recordings you made, making this update even more useful. That transcription can then be summarized, shared, or edited any way you like, which is great because it means I'll no longer have to carry another phone or use another app just to get transcription for my recordings.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-games-games-games"><span>Games games games</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.45%;"><img id="aViACzFk4QNFYb6u9t249n" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-game-performance" alt="Accessing the enhanced Game Assistant UI while playing Minecraft on a OnePlus 13 running OxygenOS 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aViACzFk4QNFYb6u9t249n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1156" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>evenGames are finally, <em>finally</em> running at full speed in OxygenOS 16, with proper 120FPS support for any game that can push those limits. This is part of a total overhaul OnePlus did to enhance fluidity and speed for this release, and it includes a big upgrade for the Game Assistant tool built into the phone.</p><p>This tool features a metric ton of options now, including better profiles that help scale performance based on your needs. Game Assistant even does great things like organize all your screenshots and recordings into albums for each game, making it simple to find what you need, well after playing them.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-still-the-best-multitasking-in-the-biz"><span>Still the best multitasking in the biz</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="gsXJ9VoMTVmE5HQcxsJd7o" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-multitasking-ui" alt="The multitasking UI on a OnePlus 13 running OxygenOS 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gsXJ9VoMTVmE5HQcxsJd7o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus dropped a teaser for the upcoming OnePlus 15 running OxygenOS 16 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@oneplus/post/DPlIc6bkpXt">the other day</a>, and it had me worried. The only multitasking UI shown was a blatant iOS ripoff, which is a big downgrade from the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-android-multitasking-ui-ranked">best multitasking UI</a> that OxygenOS already features. Thankfully, this lame iOS ripoff version seems to just be an optional toggle rather than a replacement.</p><p>OnePlus has long had the best multitasking UIs, whether that's the ultra-fast overview screen that lets you swap between 10 apps at a time with a single swipe, or the company's incredible Open Canvas feature that debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> two years ago.</p><p>In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">OnePlus Pad 3</a> users running OxygenOS 16 now have access to a whopping 18 apps on the bottom dock, and Open Canvas has now been upgraded to support 5-app splitscreen at the same time.

While I'm hoping OnePlus adds a few more ways to quickly get to Mind Space on phones without a dedicated side key, it's easy enough to three-finger swipe down to capture anything and send it to Mind Space on this phone.</p><p>Accessing it via a quick icon on the homescreen is also fine enough, but it's what's inside that I'm really loving. Ever since Nothing launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/how-use-nothing-essential-space">Essential Space</a> with the Nothing Phone 3a series back in the Spring, other Android OEMs have been adding a similar feature that works even better than Nothing's design. Like Essential Space, OnePlus's Mind Space app is a central repository for all your note-taking and screenshot-searching needs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G8N7NZvUuScCzXQbtKwc9W" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-mind-space-gemini" alt="Integrating Mind Space on the OnePlus 13 with Google Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G8N7NZvUuScCzXQbtKwc9W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The key difference here is that, while things are easily searchable on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9" target="_blank">Pixel Screenshots app</a> for Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 phones, Mind Space is the <em>first</em> app of its kind to directly integrate into Gemini. That means you don't even have to open the app to start a search. Just ask Gemini and it'll organize everything for you!</p><p>Mind Space is also very handy for summarizing or organizing information, and can even create charts and visuals based on information you store in it. This is awesome for me, as I often take notes for briefings or interviews and then have to comb through them later to organize them. Mind Space was able to take one of these documents and turn it into a visual flow chart, giving me a quick way to organize all my thoughts.</p><p>My next request for OnePlus is to allow it to store longer documents and make importing documents to Mind Space easier than just sharing what's on screen.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-voice-recorder-upgrades"><span>Voice recorder upgrades</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3DdMDQxgQEzDJb9ivrrVPh" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-voice-recorder-transcription" alt="The new voice recorder transcription upgrades in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3DdMDQxgQEzDJb9ivrrVPh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Voice Recorder got a <strong>massive</strong> upgrade in OxygenOS 16.

Thankfully, this lame iOS ripoff version seems to just be an optional toggle rather than a replacement.</p><p>OnePlus has long had the best multitasking UIs, whether that's the ultra-fast overview screen that lets you swap between 10 apps at a time with a single swipe, or the company's incredible Open Canvas feature that debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> two years ago.</p><p>In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">OnePlus Pad 3</a> users running OxygenOS 16 now have access to a whopping 18 apps on the bottom dock, and Open Canvas has now been upgraded to support 5-app splitscreen at the same time.

This is made better by Open Canvas, which allows up to five apps to run simultaneously.</p><h2 id="pumped-with-ai-2">Pumped with AI </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HXdMerPXu7oe6dFXf63TPd" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-homescreen-widgets" alt="The new widget corner design in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXdMerPXu7oe6dFXf63TPd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What is an OS upgrade that isn't fuelled by AI? OnePlus' OxygenOS 16 comes with an AI Efficiency suite that consists of several tools that will help with almost everything a user may need. To start, "AI Writer" offers tools like mind maps, charts, and social media caption generation, so you won't have to download multiple apps that do the same thing. While "AI Scan" quickly turns documents, whiteboards, and receipts into clear, editable PDFs, so you don't have to look for a free PDF editor online.</p><p>OnePlus is really pushing the boundaries with these insane photo editing tools. AI Portrait Glow makes your photos look great, no matter the lighting, and AI Perfect Shot fine-tunes everything. It pulls images of the user from your gallery and lets you swap your face in the picture you just clicked! Plus, users also get to test out new AI features that haven't yet been released, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-unveils-two-new-ai-features-as-part-of-its-ai-playlab-launch">YumSee and Party Up</a>, which the company teased a few weeks ago.</p><p>Google Gemini syncs with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/mind-space-app-in-oxygenos-16-bridges-oneplus-ai-with-gemini-for-inspiration">Mind Space</a> to give you personalized, smart help by tapping into your saved info. This means you get really detailed, custom answers, like whipping up a home decor plan using your interior design content you saved, turning your ideas into actual projects.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G8N7NZvUuScCzXQbtKwc9W" name="oneplus-13-oxygenos-16-mind-space-gemini" alt="Integrating Mind Space on the OnePlus 13 with Google Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G8N7NZvUuScCzXQbtKwc9W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, OxygenOS 16 is making things seamless when it comes to connecting with devices in different ecosystems. It makes sharing and connecting with your Windows and Mac PCs super easy. It also works even better with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch</a> for synced notifications and lets you control your phone camera from your watch, while also letting you sync your health and fitness metrics.</p><p>OxygenOS 16 Open Beta launches tomorrow (Oct. 17), giving users early access to these new features. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15 </a>will ship with OxygenOS 16, followed by a broader rollout to other devices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He knows it might happen with every phone he bends until it breaks, because that is the nature of the type of batteries (lithium-based) in phones. Fortunately, he also knows what to do when it happens.

While I'm jealous of that, I'm glad that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-fold-smokes-up-and-explodes-during-jres-durability-test">Pixel 10 Pro Fold battery exploded</a> during a durability test. Yeah, that sounds strange, but it gives me more chances to talk about something important to me: batteries and safety. A couple more articles about it can't hurt, right?</p><p>I want to say up front that Zack knew this might happen. He knows it might happen with every phone he bends until it breaks, because that is the nature of the type of batteries (lithium-based) in phones. Fortunately, he also knows what to do when it happens. It's called <strong>thermal runaway</strong>, and it's kind of crazy.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:620px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.61%;"><img id="SYJYaRZAidcwx2YoymGgBK" name="exploded-note-7.jpg" alt="An exploded Galaxy Note 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SYJYaRZAidcwx2YoymGgBK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="620" height="413" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Thermal runaway occurs when something causes a spot in the battery to heat up, creating a self-sustaining chain reaction that heats adjacent spots until everything becomes hot enough to burn. It's chemical in nature, and while not unique to batteries, it's an important process to understand just a little. You need to be aware of what's inside your pocket.</p><p>The crazy part is how it can start. Physical damage, like bending a phone that's already broken or even just dropping it the "wrong" way, can do it, but so can sitting in the hot sun, manufacturer defects, and (you knew this was coming) just charging it.</p><p>A phone battery uses chemicals to store energy, and some of those chemicals shouldn't ever come into contact with each other. When that happens, things get bad.</p><h2 id="is-it-dangerous-2">Is it dangerous?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ku3L7QQJCa5qsiZsGiDrdA" name="android-multitasking-ui-oneplus-pixel-nothing-honor-motorola-vivo-02" alt="Showing the different multitasking UIs on six different Android phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ku3L7QQJCa5qsiZsGiDrdA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yes. No. Maybe.</p><p>Every phone can have a catastrophic battery failure (a fancy word for an explosion). Every company making phones and the batteries that go into them does everything they can to prevent it. You'll probably never see it happen, let alone have it happen to you. Unless you watch YouTube, that is.</p><p>That's a bit problematic. Since it rarely happens, most people don't pay much attention when someone mentions how dangerous a lithium battery can be. It might be called an explosion, but it's not like a bomb or anything. It's a mess of gooey chemicals that burn for a long time, ignite everything they touch, and can be difficult to put out.</p><p>Different things have been done to lessen the effects, like putting vents in sealed batteries and using thin, flexible cases instead of a hard plastic shell, but until battery tech changes (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/electric-car-battery-tech-will-supercharge-your-next-smartphone">it will eventually</a>), there is no way to 100% prevent it from ever happening.</p><p>That's what people mean when they say phone batteries are dangerous. Tigers can be dangerous, and just because you're likely to never encounter one doesn't make them any less so.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-do-2">What can you do?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="m3SYYhQut9csQbYqKKjZ9G" name="InfinaCore P3 Pro" alt="InfinaCore P3 Pro 65W GaN travel charger against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m3SYYhQut9csQbYqKKjZ9G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not much. As mentioned, there are other people working to ensure the battery in your phone isn't likely to have an issue, and they are really good at it. You can trust that your phone is something you can use and carry around without something going haywire inside it.</p><p>Even phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-7">Samsung Galaxy Note 7</a>, notorious for having bad batteries, were mostly safe, and you'll find the number of problems wasn't very high. High enough for a recall doesn't mean it will happen to all of them.</p><p>The few things you can do are really just common sense. If your phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-7-and-7-pro-battery-swelling-problem">starts swelling up</a>, stop using it and have it looked at. If your phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/metal-vs-plastic-vs-glass-which-best-material-phones">gets bent</a>, stop using it and have it looked at. If your phone suddenly changes behavior while charging or all of a sudden uses all of the battery power, stop using it and have it looked at.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4976px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Yz9znjnRKU8hWJjzfNdrt9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yz9znjnRKU8hWJjzfNdrt9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4976" height="2803" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A few other things are a little more inconvenient, but still not hard to do. Never leave your phone lying in direct sunlight; treat it like a vampire. Use good, high-quality <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">name-brand cables</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-60w-usb-c-chargers">wall blocks</a> to charge it. Be careful using voltage adapters when you travel. Nothing any of us can't handle.</p><p>Now, the one thing nobody likes to hear, but definitely helps: replace the battery every two years. Another factor that can directly lead to thermal runaway is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-does-battery-life-get-worse-over-time">battery degradation</a>. Even though it's hard to access, the battery in your phone is disposable and shouldn't be used once it reaches a certain point.</p><p>It makes us mad, but this is why phone makers sometimes do things that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10s-battery-takes-a-hit-after-200-cycles-courtesy-of-a-feature-you-cant-switch-off">slow down charging</a> or reduce capacity over time: they don't want to be responsible for your pants catching fire.</p><p>Finally, remember that this goes for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a>, tablet, laptop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">headphones</a>, and everything else you have that uses a rechargeable lithium battery, too. They <strong>are</strong> safe to use; you just have to be a little careful doing it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This final aspect, "enhanced realism," refers to Google's efforts to bring the textures you're describing to more vibrant life in the generated video.</p><p>Google teases that Veo 3.1 boasts "stronger prompt adherence," meaning it should take into account what the user is saying much more seriously. Additionally, Veo 3.1 has been upgraded with improved "audiovisual quality" when converting supplied images to a video.</p><p>There are three other major points Veo 3.1 touches on, but these concern its capabilities in Flow, as it brings audio to existing features, like "Ingredients in Video."</p><p>Google states users leaning on Veo 3.1's aid in Flow can craft their videos with reference images to control "characters, objects, and styles."  Other features like "Frames to Video" for shot control and "Extend," which lets users lengthen their videos to a minute or more, also benefit from Veo 3.1's enhanced audio capabilities.</p><h2 id="imagine-now-visualize-2">Imagine, now visualize</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I06Ef8alr2Y" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Outside of where Veo 3.1 will help Flow, Google states users will find new editing tools for their generated videos. Adding new elements with "Insert" lets users quickly let their imagination alter a scene, while Flow handles "complex details," like shadows.</p><p>Flow will also grab the ability to delete anything from a scene, something straight out of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser's</a> playbook.</p><p>While Flow is beginning to receive these updates today (Oct 15), Veo 3.1 is available in the Gemini APU for devs, Vertex AI (Enterprise customers), and the Gemini app.</p><p>We were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-introduces-new-ai-tools-to-help-creatives-direct-like-a-pro">introduced to Flow</a> back in May, around the time of Google's I/O event. The company touted the new app as the perfect place for storytellers to take their ideas from their brains to the screen without spending movie-level money. Google tried to set Flow apart by fueling it with Veo 3 (also announced at I/O), Imagen 4, and Gemini.</p><p>Users already had quite a bit of control over their shots, seeing as you could alter the angle, get close-ups, and more, just by using your prompts.</p><p>Now, with what's been announced for Veo 3.1, users can take what Flow was proficient at and take it even further with enhanced audio. Veo 3.1's arrival in the Gemini app takes us back to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-photo-to-video-animates-images-veo-3-model-rollout">AI update from this summer</a>, where users could lean on the software to turn photos into a quick clip. Veo 3 did all the heavy lifting for that in the Gemini, but with Veo 3.1 rolling out, perhaps there's even more we can soon do.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Spotify, its updates rolling out this week are coming off the back of user requests, such as one consistent interest in "text requests." Beginning this week, Premium users using the DJ will find an option to type their song request alongside the typical voice feature.</p><p>Spotify says the AI DJ will adapt itself to your needs while listening. Joining this new feature are "personalized prompt suggestions." It seems these suggestions are based on your listening history/taste profile. Spotify says that when you're beginning a new DJ session, you can choose from three personalized prompts that encompass a musical genre you enjoy, plus the time of day.</p><p>On the other side, Spotify is rolling out new language support for Spanish-speaking Premium users with the AI DJ.</p><p>This was another prominent community request, as Spotify states users can now voice their interests or write their interests to the AI DJ in Spanish. These updates are rolling out for English and Spanish-speaking Premium users in over 60 markets this week, the U.S. is included.</p><h2 id="keep-the-requests-coming-2">Keep the requests coming</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1223px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dZdUdYsfEfEGdhUNe22x8L" name="spotify-dj-song-request-hero" alt="A banner informing users that Spotify's AI DJ now accepts vocal song request from Premium users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dZdUdYsfEfEGdhUNe22x8L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1223" height="688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've had Spotify's AI DJ could a couple of years now, and, earlier this year, the platform <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-dj-voice-song-requests-premium-details">updated it with song requests</a>. It started as a voice-only feature that lets users on Android long-press the DJ icon when listening to speak their request. Users can tell the DJ what song they'd like, who it's by, and so on. However, you can also get a little more personal, asking the DJ to play songs based on your mood or even a particular genre you want.</p><p>As Spotify reiterates, if you're not seeing the DJ on your homepage, then you can search for "DJ." After which, you can tap on it and begin listening to music curated by the AI, using your listening history as its backbone.</p><p>It's also worth not forgetting about Spotify's big <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-lossless-listening-premium-subscribers-hear-every-refined-note-launch">Lossless Listening</a> update that started rolling out in September.

Lossless Listening is for Premium users only, and offers its rich and deep sound to private playlists, liked songs, DJ, Jam, Mix, AI Playlists, and Daylists.</p>]]>

Moreover, the phone is now available at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/amazon-has-suddenly-dropped-a-record-smashing-usd400-off-the-galaxy-s25-edge-and-i-am-so-confused">40% discount on Amazon</a>, just five months after launch, as Samsung continues to try to boost demand.</p><p>But according to a new report from South Korea's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.newspim.com/news/view/20251016000725">Newspim</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1978711444041650536">Jukanlosreve on X</a>), Samsung has already decided to discontinue the "Edge" lineup altogether.</p><p>The report claims that Samsung has scrapped plans for the Galaxy S26 Edge, meaning next year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 lineup</a> will once again consist of three models: the Galaxy S26 Pro (base model), Galaxy S26 Plus, and Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><h2 id="the-short-lived-edge-lineup-might-already-be-over-2">The short-lived Edge lineup might already be over</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-14" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The report even goes on to claim that once the remaining Galaxy S25 Edge inventory is sold out, Samsung does not plan to manufacture any additional units. A senior Samsung executive reportedly told the publication, "I'm not sure if the slim line will ever return, but as of now, it seems unlikely. It's practically gone."</p><p>Interestingly, Samsung had already started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/leaked-galaxy-s26-edge-cad-renders-reveal-its-peculiar-design">development on the Galaxy S26 Edge</a>, which raises the possibility that it could still appear at a later date — though the report suggests this is highly unlikely now.</p><p>Earlier leaks suggested that Samsung was planning to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-could-drop-its-plus-variant-for-the-edge-shaking-up-the-galaxy-s26-lineup">replace the Plus model with the Edge version</a> in the Galaxy S26 lineup. However, those plans appear to have changed last month, when reports indicated that Samsung had resumed development of the Galaxy S26 Plus. With the S26 Edge now reportedly canceled, it seems Samsung is reverting to its traditional three-phone lineup.</p><p>There are still several months to go before Samsung officially unveils the Galaxy S26 series, but if these reports are accurate, it's safe to say goodbye to the short-lived Edge lineup.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="75b548b1-c87f-48ec-830e-4f6a23fe14ad">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKTvKqpiSi4SNKmBvZ7CGf.jpg' alt="Official render of the Galaxy S25 Edge"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>At an all-time low</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge offers a powerful processor in a thin and light form factor.

While the 2024 Edge isn't going to offer peak performance levels, it'll get the job done for most casual users. Plus, at $150 when you let Best Buy activate it for you (or $250 if you activate it yourself), it starts to look a little more competitive despite being a 2024 model.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">2024 Motorola Edge</a> still includes the luxurious-feeling, anti-slip vegan leather backing, a really nice pOLED display that's easy on the eyes, and the user-friendly Hello UI that buyers love. It comes with 256GB of storage, a 32MP front camera and both a regular rear lens and an ultrawide.</p><p>Beyond that, it's said to easily get over a full day's worth of battery life with its 5,000mAh battery, and it offers up to 68W fast charging, making it a good pick for those who value battery life.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$549.99" data-dimension48="$549.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/motorola-edge-2024-256gb-unlocked-midnight-blue/J39QWY6ZWJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="mhjKduxMg3bNi9rWrd2cZZ" name="motorola edge 2024 500x500 reco" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mhjKduxMg3bNi9rWrd2cZZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Motorola Edge 2024 (256GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/motorola-edge-2024-256gb-unlocked-midnight-blue/J39QWY6ZWJ" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$549.99" data-dimension48="$549.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$549.99</del> <strong>$149.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Best Buy's outlet and clearance sale this week is offering up to $400 off the 2024 Motorola Edge when you let them activate it for you, or up to $300 if you prefer to activate it yourself. This brings the price down to just $150-$250, marking a solid deal for anyone who doesn't mind going with a 2024 model.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/motorola-edge-2024-256gb-unlocked-midnight-blue/J39QWY6ZWJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$549.99" data-dimension48="$549.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a phone for under $200 or $300 that won't compromise on battery life or charging speeds; you like having a good-looking display that's also somewhat easy on the eyes; you've liked the luxurious feel of Motorola's anti-slip vegan leather backing on other phones.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a phone with industry-leading performance speeds; you value having a phone with a long-term software update promise; you want a phone with high-powered cameras and you have the budget to spend a little more.</p><p>The Motorola Edge lineup has offered some decent, lower-priced phones over the years. However, we've still found some of those price tags a little expensive for what you get, which is why discounts like these may be worth taking advantage of. While many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones </a>offer more powerful performance than last year's Edge, users who don't care about having a super-fast phone may appreciate other elements of the 2024 model, such as its long-lasting battery, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, as well as the beautiful, 6.6-inch pOLED display, which boasts a 144Hz refresh rate.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-vs-edge-2024">This year's Motorola Edge did include a few upgrades from the 2024 model</a>, perhaps most notably including new AI features and better cameras. For most, however, the 2024 model will offer what most casual users need, as long as you don't mind the fact that performance can be a little slow at times.</p>]]>

Now, the question is how the tech giant will respond to emerging competitors. We've seen global challengers from TECNO and mainstream contenders stateside, including the iPhone Air from Apple. Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> has more features, the iPhone Air does manage to be slimmer.</p><p>Apple achieved this feat by cleverly using the camera bump on phones to its advantage. By hiding components within the bump, which it now calls a <em>plateau</em>, it made the overall body thinner. Well, we now expect Samsung to copy Apple's homework with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Edge</a>. It's rumored to be even thinner than the iPhone Air while packing an even bigger camera bump.</p><p>That's quite a lot to consider, so which ultra-slim phone should you buy? Let's compare the rumored Galaxy S26 Edge specs against the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> offerings in this speculative breakdown.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-iphone-air-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. iPhone Air: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1416px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.20%;"><img id="v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-2" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1416" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is only a few months old, but we'll likely see a successor soon alongside the complete Galaxy S26 lineup. Based on current rumors, we expect the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge to replace both the Galaxy S25 Edge and Plus models in the new series. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">One rumor disagrees</a>, though. The Galaxy S26 Edge should be priced at the same $1,099 price, which will get you at least 256GB of storage.</p><p>The iPhone Air is slightly cheaper at $999, and it's available now. The phone ships with 256GB of storage as standard and is available in four colorways: Cloud White, Sky Blue, Space Black, and Light Gold. It's configurable with up to 1TB of internal storage.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-iphone-air-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. iPhone Air: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FrjXSbdnuxgJQJzf488pD3" name="iPhone-Air-9" alt="The back of an iPhone Air and USB-C port in Sky Blue on a blue chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FrjXSbdnuxgJQJzf488pD3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge is expected to take major design cues from the iPhone Air. Apple stuffed the majority of the iPhone Air with battery, relegating the logic board and key system components into the camera bump — now called a camera plateau. As such, the iPhone Air camera bump extends across the back of the phone, despite only holding one camera lens.</p><p>This strategy allowed the iPhone Air to usurp the Galaxy S25 Edge's thickness. The iPhone Air measures 5.64mm exactly, making it the thinnest iPhone ever and the thinnest commercially available phone in the U.S. right now.</p><p>Now, Samsung will do the same with the Galaxy S26 Edge, but to a greater degree. It will keep its dual vertically-oriented rear cameras, according to leaks and rumors, but the camera bump will now extend across the back. This will result in a camera island — or plateau, or whatever you prefer to call it — that's greater in surface area than the one on the iPhone Air. Rumors claim the camera bump itself is 5.3mm alone on the Galaxy S26 Edge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1434px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.04%;"><img id="uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-1" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1434" height="818" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this large camera bump allows Samsung to make the body of the Galaxy S26 Edge even thinner. It's said to measure 5.5mm thick, meaning Samsung would pass Apple yet again.</p><p>It's up to the consumer to decide where to draw the line as to which camera bump styles <em>cheat</em> dimensions. Is the iPhone Air really 5.64mm thick if it has a camera plateau? Or is the Galaxy S26 Edge really 5.5mm thick when a camera island taking up a third of the phone's back adds another 5.3mm of thickness? Only you can decide that, but it's worth thinking about.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oN3nfs3HV8cD7B8zTU8kn3" name="iPhone-Air-4" alt="The display of an iPhone Air in Sky Blue on a blue chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oN3nfs3HV8cD7B8zTU8kn3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A notable difference between these two phones will be their screens. The iPhone Air has a 6.5-inch display, putting it firmly between standard and "Plus" or "Max/Ultra" phones. However, the Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to sport a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel for another year, making it the exact same size as a typical Plus model from Samsung. Both the iPhone Air and the Galaxy S26 Edge will certainly have 120Hz refresh rate support, as well as HDR support.</p><p>The iPhone Air excels in two key areas: brightness and outdoor visibility. The phone's display can hit 3,000 nits in outdoor settings, whereas the Galaxy S26 Edge might top out at 2,600 nits if current specs hold. Additionally, the iPhone has a slight anti-glare coating, while the Galaxy S26 Edge may not.</p><p>For durability, both phones will use a titanium chassis and offer IP68 certification against dust and water ingress.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-iphone-air-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. iPhone Air: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VQaEsP8ve5fFrS4KBbfGi3" name="iPhone-Air-11" alt="Holding the iPhone Air in Sky Blue, showing the camera plateau." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQaEsP8ve5fFrS4KBbfGi3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone Air has specs that look great on paper, but real-world usage may be a different story. It's powered by the Apple A19 Pro chipset, although this is a binned version with one fewer GPU core than what you get in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>.

It's trying to be the thinnest phone with the least amount of compromise. In that effort, the Galaxy S26 Edge becomes an eyesore in the way the iPhone Air and even the Galaxy S25 Edge are not. However, it also adds a more capable ultrawide sensor, a larger battery, and a more powerful chip, according to rumors.</p><p>If you want the prettiest thin phone, I'd argue the iPhone Air still satisfies that craving best.

Now, the question is how the tech giant will respond to emerging competitors. We've seen global challengers from TECNO and mainstream contenders stateside, including the iPhone Air from Apple. Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> has more features, the iPhone Air does manage to be slimmer.</p><p>Apple achieved this feat by cleverly using the camera bump on phones to its advantage. By hiding components within the bump, which it now calls a <em>plateau</em>, it made the overall body thinner. Well, we now expect Samsung to copy Apple's homework with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Edge</a>. It's rumored to be even thinner than the iPhone Air while packing an even bigger camera bump.</p><p>That's quite a lot to consider, so which ultra-slim phone should you buy? Let's compare the rumored Galaxy S26 Edge specs against the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> offerings in this speculative breakdown.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-iphone-air-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. iPhone Air: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1416px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.20%;"><img id="v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-2" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1416" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is only a few months old, but we'll likely see a successor soon alongside the complete Galaxy S26 lineup. Based on current rumors, we expect the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge to replace both the Galaxy S25 Edge and Plus models in the new series. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">One rumor disagrees</a>, though. The Galaxy S26 Edge should be priced at the same $1,099 price, which will get you at least 256GB of storage.</p><p>The iPhone Air is slightly cheaper at $999, and it's available now. The phone ships with 256GB of storage as standard and is available in four colorways: Cloud White, Sky Blue, Space Black, and Light Gold. It's configurable with up to 1TB of internal storage.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-iphone-air-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. iPhone Air: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FrjXSbdnuxgJQJzf488pD3" name="iPhone-Air-9" alt="The back of an iPhone Air and USB-C port in Sky Blue on a blue chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FrjXSbdnuxgJQJzf488pD3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge is expected to take major design cues from the iPhone Air. Apple stuffed the majority of the iPhone Air with battery, relegating the logic board and key system components into the camera bump — now called a camera plateau. As such, the iPhone Air camera bump extends across the back of the phone, despite only holding one camera lens.</p><p>This strategy allowed the iPhone Air to usurp the Galaxy S25 Edge's thickness. The iPhone Air measures 5.64mm exactly, making it the thinnest iPhone ever and the thinnest commercially available phone in the U.S. right now.</p><p>Now, Samsung will do the same with the Galaxy S26 Edge, but to a greater degree. It will keep its dual vertically-oriented rear cameras, according to leaks and rumors, but the camera bump will now extend across the back. This will result in a camera island — or plateau, or whatever you prefer to call it — that's greater in surface area than the one on the iPhone Air. Rumors claim the camera bump itself is 5.3mm alone on the Galaxy S26 Edge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1434px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.04%;"><img id="uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-1" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1434" height="818" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this large camera bump allows Samsung to make the body of the Galaxy S26 Edge even thinner. It's said to measure 5.5mm thick, meaning Samsung would pass Apple yet again.</p><p>It's up to the consumer to decide where to draw the line as to which camera bump styles <em>cheat</em> dimensions. Is the iPhone Air really 5.64mm thick if it has a camera plateau? Or is the Galaxy S26 Edge really 5.5mm thick when a camera island taking up a third of the phone's back adds another 5.3mm of thickness? Only you can decide that, but it's worth thinking about.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oN3nfs3HV8cD7B8zTU8kn3" name="iPhone-Air-4" alt="The display of an iPhone Air in Sky Blue on a blue chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oN3nfs3HV8cD7B8zTU8kn3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A notable difference between these two phones will be their screens. The iPhone Air has a 6.5-inch display, putting it firmly between standard and "Plus" or "Max/Ultra" phones. However, the Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to sport a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel for another year, making it the exact same size as a typical Plus model from Samsung. Both the iPhone Air and the Galaxy S26 Edge will certainly have 120Hz refresh rate support, as well as HDR support.</p><p>The iPhone Air excels in two key areas: brightness and outdoor visibility. The phone's display can hit 3,000 nits in outdoor settings, whereas the Galaxy S26 Edge might top out at 2,600 nits if current specs hold.

Now, the question is how the tech giant will respond to emerging competitors. We've seen global challengers from TECNO and mainstream contenders stateside, including the iPhone Air from Apple. Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> has more features, the iPhone Air does manage to be slimmer.</p><p>Apple achieved this feat by cleverly using the camera bump on phones to its advantage. By hiding components within the bump, which it now calls a <em>plateau</em>, it made the overall body thinner. Well, we now expect Samsung to copy Apple's homework with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Edge</a>. It's rumored to be even thinner than the iPhone Air while packing an even bigger camera bump.</p><p>That's quite a lot to consider, so which ultra-slim phone should you buy? Let's compare the rumored Galaxy S26 Edge specs against the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> offerings in this speculative breakdown.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-iphone-air-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. iPhone Air: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1416px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.20%;"><img id="v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-2" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1416" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is only a few months old, but we'll likely see a successor soon alongside the complete Galaxy S26 lineup. Based on current rumors, we expect the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge to replace both the Galaxy S25 Edge and Plus models in the new series. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">One rumor disagrees</a>, though. The Galaxy S26 Edge should be priced at the same $1,099 price, which will get you at least 256GB of storage.</p><p>The iPhone Air is slightly cheaper at $999, and it's available now. The phone ships with 256GB of storage as standard and is available in four colorways: Cloud White, Sky Blue, Space Black, and Light Gold. It's configurable with up to 1TB of internal storage.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-iphone-air-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. iPhone Air: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FrjXSbdnuxgJQJzf488pD3" name="iPhone-Air-9" alt="The back of an iPhone Air and USB-C port in Sky Blue on a blue chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FrjXSbdnuxgJQJzf488pD3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge is expected to take major design cues from the iPhone Air. Apple stuffed the majority of the iPhone Air with battery, relegating the logic board and key system components into the camera bump — now called a camera plateau. As such, the iPhone Air camera bump extends across the back of the phone, despite only holding one camera lens.</p><p>This strategy allowed the iPhone Air to usurp the Galaxy S25 Edge's thickness. The iPhone Air measures 5.64mm exactly, making it the thinnest iPhone ever and the thinnest commercially available phone in the U.S. right now.</p><p>Now, Samsung will do the same with the Galaxy S26 Edge, but to a greater degree. It will keep its dual vertically-oriented rear cameras, according to leaks and rumors, but the camera bump will now extend across the back. This will result in a camera island — or plateau, or whatever you prefer to call it — that's greater in surface area than the one on the iPhone Air. Rumors claim the camera bump itself is 5.3mm alone on the Galaxy S26 Edge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1434px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.04%;"><img id="uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-1" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1434" height="818" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this large camera bump allows Samsung to make the body of the Galaxy S26 Edge even thinner.

Is the iPhone Air really 5.64mm thick if it has a camera plateau? Or is the Galaxy S26 Edge really 5.5mm thick when a camera island taking up a third of the phone's back adds another 5.3mm of thickness?

The iPhone Air has a 6.5-inch display, putting it firmly between standard and "Plus" or "Max/Ultra" phones. However, the Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to sport a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel for another year, making it the exact same size as a typical Plus model from Samsung. Both the iPhone Air and the Galaxy S26 Edge will certainly have 120Hz refresh rate support, as well as HDR support.</p><p>The iPhone Air excels in two key areas: brightness and outdoor visibility. The phone's display can hit 3,000 nits in outdoor settings, whereas the Galaxy S26 Edge might top out at 2,600 nits if current specs hold. Additionally, the iPhone has a slight anti-glare coating, while the Galaxy S26 Edge may not.</p><p>For durability, both phones will use a titanium chassis and offer IP68 certification against dust and water ingress.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-iphone-air-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. iPhone Air: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VQaEsP8ve5fFrS4KBbfGi3" name="iPhone-Air-11" alt="Holding the iPhone Air in Sky Blue, showing the camera plateau." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQaEsP8ve5fFrS4KBbfGi3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone Air has specs that look great on paper, but real-world usage may be a different story. It's powered by the Apple A19 Pro chipset, although this is a binned version with one fewer GPU core than what you get in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>.

It'll ship with a larger 4,200mAh battery, according to rumors. That's still less than most phones in its size class, but it is way more than the 3,149mAh battery in the iPhone Air.</p><p>Truth be told, Apple manages to squeeze a surprising amount of battery life from the iPhone Air, so we'll have to test these phones before giving a battery verdict.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.22%;"><img id="NEUQQEbKbj4ayGpmX98QRZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-3" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NEUQQEbKbj4ayGpmX98QRZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1426" height="816" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another separator between these phones is their camera offerings. Apple has the advantage in selfie capture, with a square sensor that can take vertical or portrait shots without rotating the device. It can also use Center Stage to zoom out in the software to fit everyone in the photo. In comparison, the Galaxy S26 Edge's selfie camera isn't expected to include any of these tricks.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge will have the standout rear camera system, with a 200MP primary shooter and a 50MP ultrawide camera. The iPhone Air only has a 48MP camera sensor on the back. While it can use sensor crop to mimic 2x optical zoom like the Galaxy S26 Edge, there's no getting around the lack of an ultrawide cam for wide shots.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-iphone-air-which-should-you-plan-to-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. iPhone Air: Which should you plan to buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qf96a2e9iVtQFqEqLNwNn3" name="iPhone-Air-10" alt="The volume rocker and action button on an iPhone Air in Sky Blue." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qf96a2e9iVtQFqEqLNwNn3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge and the iPhone Air figure to have just as many differences as similarities. They're both thin phones, but the iPhone Air seems to prioritize minimal design as much as a slim and lightweight build. That's evidenced by the inclusion of only one rear camera and the relatively small camera plateau — at least compared to the Galaxy S26 Edge's rumored camera island.</p><p>Meanwhile, it's clear that the Galaxy S26 Edge will be the winner on paper. It's trying to be the thinnest phone with the least amount of compromise. In that effort, the Galaxy S26 Edge becomes an eyesore in the way the iPhone Air and even the Galaxy S25 Edge are not. However, it also adds a more capable ultrawide sensor, a larger battery, and a more powerful chip, according to rumors.</p><p>If you want the prettiest thin phone, I'd argue the iPhone Air still satisfies that craving best. Those wanting the most features in the thinnest package should wait for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge instead.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ed8a358a-9114-4728-bfd1-6022371fa4e0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UuNfEhb6YPDD2Hq8LNhJX.jpg' alt="A sample Galaxy S26 Edge render from OnLeaks and Android Headlines."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A winner for 2026?</strong></em></p><p>Apple "cheated" thinness by using the camera bump to its advantage, and Samsung looks to be doing the same with the Galaxy S26 Edge.

For its time, it was arguably one of the top Android smartphones with very little competition. But that will soon change in a few months once Samsung unveils the Galaxy S26 Ultra. If you've not yet upgraded to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, should you finally trade your S24 Ultra in for the S26 Ultra?</p><p>Theoretically, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should offer a much more noticeable improvement in design and features compared to the S24 Ultra. While it's all speculative right now, based on rumors and leaks that we have, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is shaping up to be a pretty impressive flagship. Let's break down all the details we know so far about the Galaxy S26 Ultra and see how it's better than the S24 Ultra.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.77%;"><img id="9RZcULZhDCDxmhACKyrKmW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9RZcULZhDCDxmhACKyrKmW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung seems to be preparing for a major design overhaul for the Galaxy S26 Ultra, if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-and-s26-pro-could-get-a-subtle-but-noticeable-reshuffle">leaked CAD renders</a> of the new series turn out to be true. The Ultra is expected to more closely resemble the standard S26 line with even more prominently rounded corners. This should definitely help better the ergonomics from before. The phone is also expected to be a lot slimmer, dropping down to 7.8mm in thickness.</p><p>This will be a huge improvement compared to the Galaxy S24 Ultra's 8.6mm thickness. There's no mention of weight, but that should also take a nose-dive to the lower 200-gram territory. Overall, you should expect a drastically improved in-hand feel with the Galaxy S26 Ultra, compared to the S24 Ultra.</p><p>The Ultra series has always had one of the best displays in any Android phone, and that's expected to get even better. Rumor has it that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will continue to sport the slightly larger 6.9-inch display of its predecessor, but it will be getting a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-might-pack-a-display-that-hides-your-screen-from-prying-side-glances">Privacy Display feature</a>. Hints of this feature were found in a One UI 8.5 teardown, pointing towards it being exclusive to the S26 Ultra. This also means we'll be getting new display tech in the Ultra, which could be the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungdisplay.com/eng/media/news/detail/ssdsNews-240227.jsp" target="_blank"> “Flex Magic Pixel” technology</a> that Samsung's display division has been working on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JSWpEtXtpmh2kSKikBmvB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-purple-03.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JSWpEtXtpmh2kSKikBmvB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra will end up being more distinctive compared to the S26 Ultra, thanks to its sharply contoured edges. This boxy look is what helped the Ultra stand out from every other Android flagship all these years. This, of course, comes at the cost of ergonomics. It's not the most comfortable phone to hold to carry around due to its sheer size and weight. Build quality is still top-notch, and it's a phone that should last long after even the software updates stop coming.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra has one of the best displays on a flagship, and this holds true even today. It's not perfect, though, as some units in the initial batches reported a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-grainy-mura-problem-reported">phenomenon called mura</a>, where not all pixels produced the same level of brightness, leading to a grainy look.

Samsung only offered 12GB of RAM on all its storage tiers for the S24 Ultra.</p><p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the S24 Ultra is still plenty powerful and should have no trouble handling modern games and multitasking. Some of the newer AI features in the upcoming One UI 8.5 might be hardware-dependent, which means you may or may not be able to use them on the S24 Ultra. Also, many of the AI features that debuted with the S24 Ultra relied on cloud connectivity, which is something the new Gen 5 chip in the S26 Ultra hopes to resolve.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zmoVcSqF5qQQnZytB9LVb" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-yellow-purple-camera-lenses-01.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zmoVcSqF5qQQnZytB9LVb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The fact that there aren't any solid leaks or murmurs yet about any new camera upgrades on the S26 Ultra has me worried a bit.

The only issue we really faced was that the camera has a tough time capturing sharp-looking motion shots of moving kids or pets. Although Samsung did try and rectify it in 2024 by issuing a patch, it still wasn't perfect when compared to its peers.</p><p>If you go pixel-peeping, you may spot a bunch of differences between shots taken with the Galaxy S26 Ultra and S24 Ultra.

If not the new features or better performance, the rumored slimmer and lighter design itself should be worth the upgrade. You'll be able to make a more informed decision once Samsung makes it official, but so far, I'm liking the new design direction Samsung has gone with. Keep in mind that the S Pen in the S26 Ultra will most likely not have Bluetooth (just like the S25 Ultra), so be prepared to lose that feature.</p><p>Buying a new Galaxy S24 Ultra in 2026 does not make a whole lot of sense unless you score some crazy deal and get the 512GB variant for under $800. Even then, I'd take a second look at all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> in the market at the time before taking the plunge.

For its time, it was arguably one of the top Android smartphones with very little competition. But that will soon change in a few months once Samsung unveils the Galaxy S26 Ultra. If you've not yet upgraded to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, should you finally trade your S24 Ultra in for the S26 Ultra?</p><p>Theoretically, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should offer a much more noticeable improvement in design and features compared to the S24 Ultra. While it's all speculative right now, based on rumors and leaks that we have, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is shaping up to be a pretty impressive flagship. Let's break down all the details we know so far about the Galaxy S26 Ultra and see how it's better than the S24 Ultra.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.77%;"><img id="9RZcULZhDCDxmhACKyrKmW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9RZcULZhDCDxmhACKyrKmW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung seems to be preparing for a major design overhaul for the Galaxy S26 Ultra, if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-and-s26-pro-could-get-a-subtle-but-noticeable-reshuffle">leaked CAD renders</a> of the new series turn out to be true. The Ultra is expected to more closely resemble the standard S26 line with even more prominently rounded corners. This should definitely help better the ergonomics from before. The phone is also expected to be a lot slimmer, dropping down to 7.8mm in thickness.</p><p>This will be a huge improvement compared to the Galaxy S24 Ultra's 8.6mm thickness. There's no mention of weight, but that should also take a nose-dive to the lower 200-gram territory. Overall, you should expect a drastically improved in-hand feel with the Galaxy S26 Ultra, compared to the S24 Ultra.</p><p>The Ultra series has always had one of the best displays in any Android phone, and that's expected to get even better. Rumor has it that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will continue to sport the slightly larger 6.9-inch display of its predecessor, but it will be getting a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-might-pack-a-display-that-hides-your-screen-from-prying-side-glances">Privacy Display feature</a>. Hints of this feature were found in a One UI 8.5 teardown, pointing towards it being exclusive to the S26 Ultra.

This boxy look is what helped the Ultra stand out from every other Android flagship all these years. This, of course, comes at the cost of ergonomics. It's not the most comfortable phone to hold to carry around due to its sheer size and weight. Build quality is still top-notch, and it's a phone that should last long after even the software updates stop coming.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra has one of the best displays on a flagship, and this holds true even today. It's not perfect, though, as some units in the initial batches reported a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-grainy-mura-problem-reported">phenomenon called mura</a>, where not all pixels produced the same level of brightness, leading to a grainy look.

This chip promises a 20% boost in CPU and GPU performance, while using 20% less power. The neural processor is also said to have been improved for handling more on-device AI tasks.

Samsung only offered 12GB of RAM on all its storage tiers for the S24 Ultra.</p><p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the S24 Ultra is still plenty powerful and should have no trouble handling modern games and multitasking. Some of the newer AI features in the upcoming One UI 8.5 might be hardware-dependent, which means you may or may not be able to use them on the S24 Ultra. Also, many of the AI features that debuted with the S24 Ultra relied on cloud connectivity, which is something the new Gen 5 chip in the S26 Ultra hopes to resolve.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zmoVcSqF5qQQnZytB9LVb" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-yellow-purple-camera-lenses-01.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zmoVcSqF5qQQnZytB9LVb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The fact that there aren't any solid leaks or murmurs yet about any new camera upgrades on the S26 Ultra has me worried a bit.

The only issue we really faced was that the camera has a tough time capturing sharp-looking motion shots of moving kids or pets. Although Samsung did try and rectify it in 2024 by issuing a patch, it still wasn't perfect when compared to its peers.</p><p>If you go pixel-peeping, you may spot a bunch of differences between shots taken with the Galaxy S26 Ultra and S24 Ultra.

If not the new features or better performance, the rumored slimmer and lighter design itself should be worth the upgrade. You'll be able to make a more informed decision once Samsung makes it official, but so far, I'm liking the new design direction Samsung has gone with. Keep in mind that the S Pen in the S26 Ultra will most likely not have Bluetooth (just like the S25 Ultra), so be prepared to lose that feature.</p><p>Buying a new Galaxy S24 Ultra in 2026 does not make a whole lot of sense unless you score some crazy deal and get the 512GB variant for under $800. Even then, I'd take a second look at all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> in the market at the time before taking the plunge.

For its time, it was arguably one of the top Android smartphones with very little competition. But that will soon change in a few months once Samsung unveils the Galaxy S26 Ultra. If you've not yet upgraded to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, should you finally trade your S24 Ultra in for the S26 Ultra?</p><p>Theoretically, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should offer a much more noticeable improvement in design and features compared to the S24 Ultra. While it's all speculative right now, based on rumors and leaks that we have, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is shaping up to be a pretty impressive flagship. Let's break down all the details we know so far about the Galaxy S26 Ultra and see how it's better than the S24 Ultra.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.77%;"><img id="9RZcULZhDCDxmhACKyrKmW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9RZcULZhDCDxmhACKyrKmW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung seems to be preparing for a major design overhaul for the Galaxy S26 Ultra, if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-and-s26-pro-could-get-a-subtle-but-noticeable-reshuffle">leaked CAD renders</a> of the new series turn out to be true. The Ultra is expected to more closely resemble the standard S26 line with even more prominently rounded corners. This should definitely help better the ergonomics from before. The phone is also expected to be a lot slimmer, dropping down to 7.8mm in thickness.</p><p>This will be a huge improvement compared to the Galaxy S24 Ultra's 8.6mm thickness. There's no mention of weight, but that should also take a nose-dive to the lower 200-gram territory. Overall, you should expect a drastically improved in-hand feel with the Galaxy S26 Ultra, compared to the S24 Ultra.</p><p>The Ultra series has always had one of the best displays in any Android phone, and that's expected to get even better. Rumor has it that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will continue to sport the slightly larger 6.9-inch display of its predecessor, but it will be getting a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-might-pack-a-display-that-hides-your-screen-from-prying-side-glances">Privacy Display feature</a>. Hints of this feature were found in a One UI 8.5 teardown, pointing towards it being exclusive to the S26 Ultra. This also means we'll be getting new display tech in the Ultra, which could be the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungdisplay.com/eng/media/news/detail/ssdsNews-240227.jsp" target="_blank"> “Flex Magic Pixel” technology</a> that Samsung's display division has been working on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JSWpEtXtpmh2kSKikBmvB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-purple-03.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JSWpEtXtpmh2kSKikBmvB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra will end up being more distinctive compared to the S26 Ultra, thanks to its sharply contoured edges. This boxy look is what helped the Ultra stand out from every other Android flagship all these years. This, of course, comes at the cost of ergonomics. It's not the most comfortable phone to hold to carry around due to its sheer size and weight. Build quality is still top-notch, and it's a phone that should last long after even the software updates stop coming.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra has one of the best displays on a flagship, and this holds true even today. It's not perfect, though, as some units in the initial batches reported a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-grainy-mura-problem-reported">phenomenon called mura</a>, where not all pixels produced the same level of brightness, leading to a grainy look. It does get the anti-glare coating, which makes a massive difference when viewing the display under sunlight or against artificial light sources.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-performance-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra: Performance and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.70%;"><img id="rcJq6g3FrXH6vabXiVUcvD" name="Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5" alt="Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rcJq6g3FrXH6vabXiVUcvD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4037" height="2289" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra will most likely use a custom version of Qualcomm's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 SoC</a>. This chip promises a 20% boost in CPU and GPU performance, while using 20% less power. The neural processor is also said to have been improved for handling more on-device AI tasks. Other specs will most likely include 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage, although a 1TB variant and even 16GB RAM should be on offer in select countries, just like the S25 Ultra.

Given how Samsung has announced the new S series at the start of the year in January, we could expect the same for the S26 Ultra as well. The phone should go on sale in the weeks following the announcement. If Samsung sticks to the same pricing, then the S26 Ultra should start at $1,299.99.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ymJGfhDJUFbqMEyqRGWMUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-11" alt="One UI 7 Quick Settings panel on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ymJGfhDJUFbqMEyqRGWMUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other features that the Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to have include the S Pen, an IP68 rating (or maybe IP69), and run One UI 8.5 based on Android 16. Samsung should continue to offer seven years of software and security updates, too. While we would absolutely love a larger battery, I'm not entirely sure if that'll be possible if the Ultra slims down further. I'll be surprised if Samsung manages to squeeze in the same capacity as the S25 Ultra.</p><p>Another question that remains is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">whether the S26 Ultra will get native Qi2 charging</a> or if you'll need a case to enable this.

If you've already set aside a budget of over $1,000 for an Ultra phone, it'd better be the latest model. Samsung only offered 12GB of RAM on all its storage tiers for the S24 Ultra.</p><p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the S24 Ultra is still plenty powerful and should have no trouble handling modern games and multitasking. Some of the newer AI features in the upcoming One UI 8.5 might be hardware-dependent, which means you may or may not be able to use them on the S24 Ultra. Also, many of the AI features that debuted with the S24 Ultra relied on cloud connectivity, which is something the new Gen 5 chip in the S26 Ultra hopes to resolve.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zmoVcSqF5qQQnZytB9LVb" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-yellow-purple-camera-lenses-01.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zmoVcSqF5qQQnZytB9LVb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The fact that there aren't any solid leaks or murmurs yet about any new camera upgrades on the S26 Ultra has me worried a bit. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> had a fine set of cameras, and the new 50MP resolution upgrade for the ultrawide was more than welcome. But I have a feeling that the S26 Ultra might not get any truly exciting hardware upgrades for the next generation.</p><p>You could expect some software trickery and new GalaxyAI features in the camera app, but that'll probably be the extent of it. In all honesty, the Ultra series has always had the best cameras in the lineup, so it's hard to top that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's cameras can still give stiff competition to today's flagship phones. Zoom performance is really impressive, and low-light images and video recording look great. The only issue we really faced was that the camera has a tough time capturing sharp-looking motion shots of moving kids or pets. Although Samsung did try and rectify it in 2024 by issuing a patch, it still wasn't perfect when compared to its peers.</p><p>If you go pixel-peeping, you may spot a bunch of differences between shots taken with the Galaxy S26 Ultra and S24 Ultra. Other than that, I don't see the cameras in the upcoming Ultra to be drastically different.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-is-it-worth-the-upgrade-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra: Is it worth the upgrade?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CJ3tKHPmEXBczgC7e3A7iW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJ3tKHPmEXBczgC7e3A7iW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you currently own a Galaxy S24 Ultra and are looking for something new with a stylus, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should be worth trading it in for. If not the new features or better performance, the rumored slimmer and lighter design itself should be worth the upgrade. You'll be able to make a more informed decision once Samsung makes it official, but so far, I'm liking the new design direction Samsung has gone with. Keep in mind that the S Pen in the S26 Ultra will most likely not have Bluetooth (just like the S25 Ultra), so be prepared to lose that feature.</p><p>Buying a new Galaxy S24 Ultra in 2026 does not make a whole lot of sense unless you score some crazy deal and get the 512GB variant for under $800. Even then, I'd take a second look at all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> in the market at the time before taking the plunge. The Galaxy S26 Ultra might not be the most exciting of upgrades when compared to the S25 Ultra, but it could offer compelling reasons for an S24 Ultra user to consider trading up.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="4fcfb2f7-172a-43a9-9444-78f045b34935">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RwtaJvqMJgDvj7Axd9tSn9.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra leaked render - square"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The future</strong></em></p><p>While we wait for Samsung to unveil what the Galaxy S26 Ultra will bring, the rumors and leaks paint an interesting picture.

You're probably wondering whether the Galaxy S26 Pro will bring a new and improved experience or just a different name, and we're here to help. Let's compare how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Pro</a> figures to stack up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, based on current rumors and leaks, which might change before the phone becomes official.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-vs-galaxy-s25-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro vs. Galaxy S25: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZnoxAMJ6w4bpnV5AeZY7AZ" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of Galaxy S26 Pro leak showcasing a slimmer design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZnoxAMJ6w4bpnV5AeZY7AZ.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Currently, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro's pricing and availability are up in the air. We aren't sure whether the Galaxy S26 Pro will see a price hike this generation. It might depend on whether Samsung ships the phone with 128GB or 256GB by default. At most, we're looking at around $100 tacked onto the Galaxy S25's $799 starting price.</p><p>Samsung could up the max storage and RAM configurations on the Galaxy S26 Pro, possibly raising the top capacity to 512GB or 1TB. The phone's memory could be upgraded to 16GB across the board, for certain configurations, or not at all. We expect to see the entire Samsung Galaxy S26 lineup revealed sometime around January 2026, with general availability coming soon after.</p><p>Compare that to the current Samsung Galaxy S25, which starts at $799 for 128GB of storage and 12GB of memory. The phone only goes up to 256GB of max storage in the U.S. It's available in multiple colorways, including Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow. As the Galaxy S26 release window approaches, the Galaxy S25 will see major discounts, especially around deal holidays like Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-vs-galaxy-s25-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro vs. Galaxy S25: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gKRgz2SqdcJaUh4DKQNCAZ" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of Galaxy S26 Pro leak showcasing a slimmer design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gKRgz2SqdcJaUh4DKQNCAZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro's design will look quite familiar to Galaxy fans, but it'll be a departure from what we're used to seeing on base models like the Galaxy S25. The phone will offer a flat display and Gorilla Glass on the front, mostly flat edges, and a glass back. This time, the camera lenses will sit on an oval pedestal protruding from the back, drawing inspiration from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><p>Samsung is expected to add a 6.3-inch screen to the Galaxy S26 Pro, making it larger than the Galaxy S25 in terms of footprint. The rumored dimensions, based on leaked CAD renderings, measure 149.3 x 71.4 x 6.96mm. That'd make the Galaxy S26 Pro significantly taller, slightly wider, and a bit thinner than the Galaxy S25 it'll replace.</p><p>The larger footprint and bigger camera bump might help Samsung spread out the internals and make the majority of the phone thinner. However, the Galaxy S26 Pro is rumored to measure 10.23mm thick with the camera bump included.</p><p>We don't know exactly how much the upcoming handset will weigh — the Galaxy S25 weighed in at 162 grams, but the Galaxy S26 Pro could be heavier, accounting for the extra components.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hn8GRZomrhbxLDNov8YUS7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-12" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hn8GRZomrhbxLDNov8YUS7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the notable difference in screen size — 6.2 inches on the Galaxy S25 and 6.3 inches on the Galaxy S26 Pro — the two phones will likely have similar or identical display specs.

The two phones could differ in brightness and cover glass, but we should see 2,600 nits and Corning Gorilla Glass at a minimum.</p><p>As for the build quality, both phones will be equipped with an Armor Aluminum frame and IP68 certification against dust and water-resistance.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-vs-galaxy-s25-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro vs. Galaxy S25: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qyEYgwM83FhJcV4rxp47AZ" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of Galaxy S26 Pro leak showcasing a slimmer design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qyEYgwM83FhJcV4rxp47AZ.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is expected to make major upgrades to the Galaxy S26 Pro's internals, starting with the processor.

The current Galaxy S25 has a 50MP primary shooter and two 12MP secondary cameras. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S26 Pro is tipped to bring a new main camera and ultrawide lens.

With the Galaxy S26 Pro rumored to leave that identity behind in favor of a larger footprint, the Galaxy S25 might hold onto some of its appeal.</p><p>However, there are key flaws of the Galaxy S25 that can't be ignored, like the three-year-old rear camera system that will only become more glaring as the phone ages. Samsung balances that out with the affordable cost (especially after frequent discounts) and standout components, like the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy platform. The seven-year software update promise ensures this phone will be supported for the foreseeable future.</p><p>If you want the best and are willing to pay for it, waiting for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro is the recommended option. Samsung is expected to build off and improve the Galaxy S25's strengths with a new Snapdragon processor and a bigger screen. It's also rumored to address its weaknesses by adding upgraded main and ultrawide lenses.</p><p>With these rumors in mind, the Galaxy S26 Pro is looking like one of the bigger annual upgrades from Samsung in a while.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6b077d2c-936f-4b1d-828a-70e3f6711193">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:58,l:59,cw:884,ch:884,q:80/pzkcj8YMqwNYbgHkLXibwc.jpg' alt="The rumored product render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Up and coming</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro is set to become the entry-level model in the brand's 2026 lineup.

Samsung balances that out with the affordable cost (especially after frequent discounts) and standout components, like the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy platform. The seven-year software update promise ensures this phone will be supported for the foreseeable future.</p><p>If you want the best and are willing to pay for it, waiting for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro is the recommended option. Samsung is expected to build off and improve the Galaxy S25's strengths with a new Snapdragon processor and a bigger screen. It's also rumored to address its weaknesses by adding upgraded main and ultrawide lenses.</p><p>With these rumors in mind, the Galaxy S26 Pro is looking like one of the bigger annual upgrades from Samsung in a while.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6b077d2c-936f-4b1d-828a-70e3f6711193">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:58,l:59,cw:884,ch:884,q:80/pzkcj8YMqwNYbgHkLXibwc.jpg' alt="The rumored product render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Up and coming</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro is set to become the entry-level model in the brand's 2026 lineup.

However, the Galaxy S26 Pro is rumored to measure 10.23mm thick with the camera bump included.</p><p>We don't know exactly how much the upcoming handset will weigh — the Galaxy S25 weighed in at 162 grams, but the Galaxy S26 Pro could be heavier, accounting for the extra components.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hn8GRZomrhbxLDNov8YUS7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-12" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hn8GRZomrhbxLDNov8YUS7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the notable difference in screen size — 6.2 inches on the Galaxy S25 and 6.3 inches on the Galaxy S26 Pro — the two phones will likely have similar or identical display specs.

It's working with 12GB of RAM, and is still a top performer for gaming, AI processing, and casual use. While the Galaxy S25 shipped with One UI 7, it can be upgraded to One UI 8, which is what the Galaxy S26 Pro will debut running.</p><p>Connectivity options should be consistent across both smartphones, with Wi-Fi 7, 5G, NFC, and at least Bluetooth 5.4 — though we can't rule out support for upgraded Bluetooth 6 on the Galaxy S26 Pro.</p><div ><table><caption>Rumored specs comparison</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro (Rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch, Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, Corning Gorilla Glass</p></td><td  ><p>6.2-inch, Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, Corning Gorilla Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB or 16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security </p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,300mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired, Qi2 15W or 25W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>149.3 x 71.4 x 6.96mm</p></td><td  ><p>146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>~162g</p></td><td  ><p>162g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Samsung is rumored to make the long-overdue move to add magnets to the Galaxy S26 Pro, offering full support for Qi2 wireless charging.

The battery capacity is said to be upped to 4,300mAh on the new model compared to 4,000mAh on the current Galaxy S25.</p><p>The other big upgrade concerns the main camera system. The current Galaxy S25 has a 50MP primary shooter and two 12MP secondary cameras. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S26 Pro is tipped to bring a new main camera and ultrawide lens. Rumors aren't optimistic about the main lens being a massive improvement, but it is new for 2026. Additionally, the Galaxy S26 Pro's ultrawide lens is rumored to jump from 12MP to 50MP this generation.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-vs-galaxy-s25-should-you-wait-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro vs. Galaxy S25: Should you wait?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="562KYDM4rWPqGktqWiNnUF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-17" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/562KYDM4rWPqGktqWiNnUF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 is a serviceable smartphone that has the unique distinction of being one of the few smaller flagships left. With the Galaxy S26 Pro rumored to leave that identity behind in favor of a larger footprint, the Galaxy S25 might hold onto some of its appeal.</p><p>However, there are key flaws of the Galaxy S25 that can't be ignored, like the three-year-old rear camera system that will only become more glaring as the phone ages. Samsung balances that out with the affordable cost (especially after frequent discounts) and standout components, like the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy platform. The seven-year software update promise ensures this phone will be supported for the foreseeable future.</p><p>If you want the best and are willing to pay for it, waiting for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro is the recommended option. Samsung is expected to build off and improve the Galaxy S25's strengths with a new Snapdragon processor and a bigger screen. It's also rumored to address its weaknesses by adding upgraded main and ultrawide lenses.</p><p>With these rumors in mind, the Galaxy S26 Pro is looking like one of the bigger annual upgrades from Samsung in a while.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6b077d2c-936f-4b1d-828a-70e3f6711193">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:58,l:59,cw:884,ch:884,q:80/pzkcj8YMqwNYbgHkLXibwc.jpg' alt="The rumored product render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Up and coming</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro is set to become the entry-level model in the brand's 2026 lineup.

That doesn't mean <em>you or I </em>should try to repair it, as the actual repair process is time-consuming and challenging. That doesn't change the fact that repairability matters if we're going to take smartwatches more seriously.</p><p>Look at the official 118-page <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="file:///Users/bob/Downloads/Pixel%20Watch%204%20-%2045mm%20Repair%20Manual%20V1.1-compressed.pdf" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 4 repair manual</a>.

The battery itself isn't for sale yet, but let's assume it'll be no more than a Pixel phone battery ($30–50).</p><p>You should use your one-year limited warranty first and let the pros handle it, Google said, but you <em>can</em> do it if you're technically confident or past the first year. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Google+Pixel+Watch+4+Battery+Replacement/197169">iFixit guide</a> certainly makes it look straightforward.</p><p>For every other component, though, they likened it to fixing a mechanical watch, something that's not for the faint of heart.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3pQWBFBIU2U" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/113620/the-pixel-watch-4-is-the-most-repairable-smartwatch-on-the-market">iFixit</a> gave the Watch 4 a 9/10 rating for repairability, saying they were "inside within minutes" and had little trouble detaching the display from the replaceable gasket, then removing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 2</a>.

Honor sent me a pre-production unit ahead of the launch, and my hands-on impressions are based on that model.</p><p>This one is a China model running a global version of Honor's Magic OS 10 software, which is based on Android 16. It's got the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> silicon from Qualcomm, a cutting-edge camera system, a lovely, refined build that's lighter than ever, and the most massive battery I've ever seen in a flagship phone, despite the reduction in weight.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-pro-specs-pricing-and-availability"><span>Honor Magic 8 Pro: Specs, pricing, and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5DJ2dGcN8xPkq78sumyjtK" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-magic-os-10" alt="The Magic OS 10 update screen on an Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5DJ2dGcN8xPkq78sumyjtK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Honor Magic 8 Pro is launching in China in October 2025, debuting there first before it heads to international markets, including Europe, later this year in Sunrise Gold, Sky Cyan, and Black colorways.</p><p>The phone is available in a single 12GB RAM and 512GB storage SKU at launch with a 7,200mAh battery.  The European model will launch with a 6,270mAh battery, likely due to European battery size regulations.</p><p>In the box, Honor includes a pre-installed film screen protector on the phone, a clear TPU case, a 100W charger, and a USB cable.

The soft, brushed metal sides of the phone are not only smoother than ever (in a non-slippery way, weird as that sounds), but they also naturally curve into the front and back of the chassis, providing impressive weight relief compared to last year.</p><p>I don't like most phones with flat edges, but Honor seems to have struck a nice balance between the flat side trend and a more comfortable set of curves. The display is flatter than ever, only pushing the very edges of the corners into a curve.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mxboUo5a58cnT8MtZ2LyAW" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-camera-island-02" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Pro's textured camera island" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mxboUo5a58cnT8MtZ2LyAW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="g6z9i9XKD4M5DE3gVpn7BW" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-side" alt="The left side of the Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g6z9i9XKD4M5DE3gVpn7BW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8cQBpSJhMNDcgvfdke6pBW" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-camera-island-01" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Pro's camera island and camera sensors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8cQBpSJhMNDcgvfdke6pBW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qvS9Fef3YSRBJGhG8Yu87d" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-back-logo" alt="The back of the Sunrise Gold Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qvS9Fef3YSRBJGhG8Yu87d.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MZJYXq9H8H62phiCy9t3Cd" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-back-04" alt="The back of the Sunrise Gold Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MZJYXq9H8H62phiCy9t3Cd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>A new AI button is the marketed highlight of the new design, though it is located about two-thirds of the way down the right side of the phone. This long button is flush with the frame and primarily functions as an AI button out of the box, although it also works as a camera control button, including swipe-to-zoom functionality.</p><p>Long-pressing the button will activate the YOYO video AI functionality in China, with functionality that at least mirrors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> in some respects. International models will likely have this function with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> instead of YOYO, but Honor hasn't announced those plans yet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dhdxpUvjU8r9H8NrE2pEPd" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-ai-memories" alt="Searching for "Harry Potter" in the AI memories app on an Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dhdxpUvjU8r9H8NrE2pEPd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also customize a single or double press of this button to launch the AI memories center, launch the camera, or take a screenshot for storage in AI memories.</p><p>It's this last feature that I loved the most, as it made it easy to catalog information throughout my day. For example, as I was scrolling through Instagram, I saw a local post about a Harry Potter event happening at the end of the month. Tapping the AI button stored the screenshot of this event in my AI memories, and I can simply search for "Harry Potter" in the AI memories app to find it.</p><p>This sort of context-sensitive information searching is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots app</a> and is my favorite way to find information these days. On the Chinese models, you can even ask YOYO to "find all my screenshots and delete the blurry ones." The implementation here doesn't feel overbearing at all and is completely ignorable if you don't want to use it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="njhnDQraZJh9ttghLaQkDj" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-display-outdoor-visibility" alt="Zooming in on a macro photo of a flower, which was taken with the Honor Magic 8 Pro's camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/njhnDQraZJh9ttghLaQkDj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even if you don't care at all about the new AI button, you <em>will</em> care about the new battery. The Magic 8 Pro packs in the largest battery I've ever seen in a traditional flagship phone, sporting Honor's latest silicon-carbon battery tech that boasts an unbelievable 7,100mAh capacity, and yet the phone weighs less than last year's despite the capacity upgrade.</p><p>This battery tech <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/electric-car-battery-tech-will-supercharge-your-next-smartphone">was in the Honor Magic V5</a>, and it also boasted a similar capacity upgrade. I went two full days without charging and still had just under 20% left at the start of the third day in my testing so far, so this isn't "empty capacity" or something. It's the real deal.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-pro-holy-smokes-this-camera"><span>Honor Magic 8 Pro: Holy smokes this camera</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="K9txp2Du9LVF6zLFUtkc6" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-camera-flowers" alt="Taking a photo of pink mums with the Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K9txp2Du9LVF6zLFUtkc6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I took the Honor Magic 8 Pro out for a fall fun day and was impressed with every shot I took. As I've come to expect from Honor phones, this one does particularly well when using portrait mode, capturing motion, or using the telephoto camera. Even Honor's more affordable phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-400-pro-camera-review-passing-the-test-with-full-honors">take stunning portrait mode shots</a>, so it's no surprise to see that elevated here with even better sensors.</p><p>Photos taken using any of the 2x, 3.7x, or 10x presets in the viewfinder are exceptional. Every scenario I put the camera through delivered excellent results, and I'm not sure I can expect more from any camera in the under 10x zoom range.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

Honor sent me a pre-production unit ahead of the launch, and my hands-on impressions are based on that model.</p><p>This one is a China model running a global version of Honor's Magic OS 10 software, which is based on Android 16.

The soft, brushed metal sides of the phone are not only smoother than ever (in a non-slippery way, weird as that sounds), but they also naturally curve into the front and back of the chassis, providing impressive weight relief compared to last year.</p><p>I don't like most phones with flat edges, but Honor seems to have struck a nice balance between the flat side trend and a more comfortable set of curves.

This long button is flush with the frame and primarily functions as an AI button out of the box, although it also works as a camera control button, including swipe-to-zoom functionality.</p><p>Long-pressing the button will activate the YOYO video AI functionality in China, with functionality that at least mirrors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> in some respects. International models will likely have this function with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> instead of YOYO, but Honor hasn't announced those plans yet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dhdxpUvjU8r9H8NrE2pEPd" name="honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on-ai-memories" alt="Searching for "Harry Potter" in the AI memories app on an Honor Magic 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dhdxpUvjU8r9H8NrE2pEPd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also customize a single or double press of this button to launch the AI memories center, launch the camera, or take a screenshot for storage in AI memories.</p><p>It's this last feature that I loved the most, as it made it easy to catalog information throughout my day. For example, as I was scrolling through Instagram, I saw a local post about a Harry Potter event happening at the end of the month. Tapping the AI button stored the screenshot of this event in my AI memories, and I can simply search for "Harry Potter" in the AI memories app to find it.</p><p>This sort of context-sensitive information searching is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots app</a> and is my favorite way to find information these days.

Honor sent me a pre-production unit ahead of the launch, and my hands-on impressions are based on that model.</p><p>This one is a China model running a global version of Honor's Magic OS 10 software, which is based on Android 16.

For example, as I was scrolling through Instagram, I saw a local post about a Harry Potter event happening at the end of the month. Tapping the AI button stored the screenshot of this event in my AI memories, and I can simply search for "Harry Potter" in the AI memories app to find it.</p><p>This sort of context-sensitive information searching is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots app</a> and is my favorite way to find information these days. On the Chinese models, you can even ask YOYO to "find all my screenshots and delete the blurry ones."

According to the post, beginning this week, users on YouTube will soon notice a refreshed video player that's cleaner and "more immersive" across every device capable of running the app. Visually, the new player brings the play/pause button to the center of the bottom control bar.</p><p>On the left, users will find the channel's icon and buttons for the description box and "subscribe." The right side features the thumbs up/down buttons, comments, a save icon, CC, and video player settings.</p><p>All of these elements (save for the play/pause button) are transparent for the most part. It gives a slightly more modern feel as users won't necessarily miss what's going on behind the UI elements if they happen to activate the player.

Samsung's already given a date, so we won't have to keep this guessing game going for much longer.</p><p>One thing we're still left wondering is whether or not the U.S. will see Project Moohan launching at the same time as South Korea. This is something earlier reports claimed could be intentional from Samsung as it "assesses" the headset's sales performance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Released in 2015, this operating system introduced a dramatic shift away from the "Metro" interface of Windows 8 and 8.1. It's also been regularly maintained despite Windows 11's introduction in 2011, with millions of users still relying on it for their daily computing needs.</p><p>So, with Microsoft ending the chapter on Windows 10, what does that actually mean? For starters, it's not like your laptop or computer will just stop working altogether. Those with compatible computers will likely eventually upgrade to Windows 11, but what if your computer doesn't meet the requirements? Well, you're in luck, as you can install ChromeOS Flex and not worry about buying something brand new when your current laptop works fine.</p><h2 id="what-is-chromeos-flex-2">What is ChromeOS Flex</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="rHKWqM4dXR3ZAb5VjozRci" name="install-chromeos-flex-screen" alt="Install or try out ChromeOS Flex during the initial setup process" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rHKWqM4dXR3ZAb5VjozRci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chrome-os-flex">ChromeOS Flex</a> has been around for quite some time, as it was originally known as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-try-chromeos-virtual-machine-you-buy-chromebook">CloudReady</a> and was developed by Neverware. It allowed you to install and use a modified version of ChromeOS on a virtual machine, adding a layer of versatility to your computing arsenal.

In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/FBjhQRide_8">the video</a>, there are two products: the Pixel Buds 2a and the Pixel Buds Pro 2. Each is in their respective cases, as viewers can see the differences between the larger, higher battery capacity Pro model and the smaller budget offering.</p><p>The video's host removes the Buds Pro 2 from their case and places them into the Buds 2a case. The earbuds surprisingly fit well inside that case, as even the case recognizes the connectors meeting the charging pins with the white light.</p><p>In their phone's "device details," the product still shows up as the Pixel Buds 2a, considering that's the case being used. However, it clearly shows both buds are charging and the charge on the case, too. This example was a little wonky, as the device kept alerting them about the Buds' charging details with the UI notification, which could be because they've swapped earbuds entirely.</p><p>The video shows that the Buds 2a can fit in the Pro case, as the light indicating charging illuminates, as well as the model appearing as expected on their phone. What's curious about this is, as 9to5 notes, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/11997887?hl=en-GB">doesn't mention this</a> as an acknowledged trait for its devices.</p><h2 id="an-unexpected-find-2">An unexpected find</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1290px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.51%;"><img id="GsZew3cB8oSRAhVEYxTMR7" name="google-pixel-buds-2-pro-2a-case-example" alt="A screenshot from a video, showing that users an place their Pixel Buds Pro 2 into the Pixel Buds 2a case and still charge the product." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GsZew3cB8oSRAhVEYxTMR7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1290" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As the post also notes, it's not inherently clear <em>if </em>users should swap their buds between cases. Although it seems a little odd to say that, considering you're still charging the buds in the end, and the cases recognize each model, though they're not for that specific product. Whatever the case may be, this reminds us of the whole USB-C push for phones.</p><p>Every phone features a USB-C, and users can effectively just ask their buddy for their charger if they're low. You're not exactly fretting the fact that they've got a Samsung charger, but you've got a Motorola. This Buds 2 Pro/2a case swap is giving similar vibes. The publication theorizes that Google could—if they'd like—move into this worldview with their earbuds, but who knows.</p><p>The Pixel Buds Pro 2 just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-update-rolls-out-head-gestures-adaptive-audio-android">received a huge update</a> toward the end of September that brought Head Gestures and Adaptive Audio to all users.

That message you posted in the lobby of some silly phone game you downloaded is probably saved and offered as part of an AI-training package for sale to the highest bidder.</p><p>This isn't a big deal to a lot of people, but for others, it is. Only you can decide if Google or OpenAI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/reddits-sale-user-data-ai-training-draws-ftc-investigation/#:~:text=Reddit%20has%20been%20licensing%20data,has%20a%20stake%20in%20Reddit." target="_blank">using all of your Reddit posts</a> matters to you (they do). It's also not going to change any time soon in many places: remember, data privacy laws apply, so if you live in the EU, for example, there are different rules for your data than there are in the U.S.</p><p>Assume everything you do online is out there for the rest of us to see if you want to be proactive. You can't scrub it away, no matter how hard you try, so be thoughtful before you share anything. No matter how much we may not like it, it will be OK.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>There are plenty of tech products out there. Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV" name="lloyd-should-you-buy_720" caption="" alt="Lloyd going shopping!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">So many tech products! It can help if you take a breath, a step back, and think about what you <em>really</em> need. We're here to help you do just that!</p></div></div><p>Often, it's good to take a step back and see what you're going to get inside that pretty package. Was it worth what you paid for it? Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p>Should you buy a brand-new 2025 Moto G for $50? Because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/moto-g-2025?srsltid=AfmBOord72tlWzTlSuCXZD7Lq_2xVcLEu7U4XVMBdfojkh99PI2ONzXd&pli=1" target="_blank">Google wants to sell you one</a>.</p><p>In 2025, fifty dollars doesn't buy much. Inflation has gone crazy in the past 12 months; everything is going up except the paycheck, and money still doesn't grow on trees. There's a good chance you'll spend more than $50 at the gas pump nowadays.</p><p>But you can get a phone, a brand-spanking new one, for $50 from Google Fi. They're selling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">2025 Moto G</a> unlocked for $49.99 plus those pesky taxes and such. Is it worth it?</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jqsEAK95C6CqCf365eAxFL" name="moto-g-2025-back-01" alt="The lovely vegan leather back texture on the Moto G 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jqsEAK95C6CqCf365eAxFL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G isn't the most premium high-end device the world has ever seen, and most people consider it a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget model</a>. I would. But that doesn't mean it's junk.</p><p><strong>It has a huge battery</strong>. It's not a tiny phone or one of those thin phones that somehow became cool again, but it's not some gargantuan beast like the Galaxy S Ultra either. Regardless, it has a 5,000 mAh battery inside that <strong>will</strong> last you all day. This time, you can believe them when they say all-day battery life.</p><p><strong>It has 5G</strong>. It's unlocked and will work almost anywhere on earth. Does it have support for every radio band? Nope. But MediaTek and Motorola made sure it works just fine for most everyone in most places.</p><p><strong>It has a big screen</strong>. 6.7 inches to be exact. It's a 720 x 1604 pixel, 20:9 ratio display that checks in at a respectable 262 ppi (pixels-per-inch) density, so things don't look like fuzzy garbage.</p><p><strong>It has an SD card slot</strong>. The phone comes with 128GB of on-board storage and can handle a 1TB <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-sd-card-speeds-and-your-phone">SD card</a> slot if that's your thing.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rjxTBU7FWF32BieRyxjoX5" name="moto-g-2025-lcd-01" alt="The surprisingly bright and vibrant LCD screen on the Moto G 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rjxTBU7FWF32BieRyxjoX5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Three things instantly come to mind here, and no price reduction will "fix" them.</p><p><strong>The camera</strong>. It's capable at 50MP and has a decent macro mode, but this is not the camera that will wow you like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel</a> or iPhone camera will. It's plenty good enough for most photos, but it isn't going to handle things like your dog running a million miles per hour or anything.</p><p><strong>It uses an LCD</strong>. It's 120Hz capable and doesn't have huge bezels everyone seems to hate, but it's an LCD. Blacks aren't as black, and viewing angles matter. Whites aren't pinkish-bluish-green like they are on an OLED either, so this could be a pro as well.</p><p><strong>It has 4GB of memory</strong>. This is enough to run regular phone things, and it should handle them all fairly easily, but some features require an insane amount of RAM, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a>. Those features can <strong>never</strong> come to this phone because it will never be able to run them.</p><p><strong>Google Fi</strong>. You don't have to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi</a> (maybe you want to try it, though), but you need to be in a place where Fi sells phones to get this one. That's a bummer because Google still hasn't figured out how to sell everything everywhere.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>So, should you buy one? No.</p><p><strong>You should think about buying </strong><em><strong>two</strong></em>.</p><p>Look, I'm a happy, well-adjusted cheapskate and hate spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on a phone. Normally, I would never say to buy a phone you don't need.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Everyone has their opinion on the Android vs. iOS debate, and it generally comes down to personal preference. However, artificial intelligence features seem like the one area where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> objectively take the crown.

Google is firing on all cylinders in AI development, and the switch from Google Assistant to Gemini resulted in generally positive feedback.</p><p>Apple Intelligence, meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pokes-fun-at-apples-iphone-17-ai-capabilities">has hit snags and roadblocks at every turn</a>. Core features advertised years ago still haven't arrived, and the ChatGPT integration aims to bail out Apple for stalling AI progress. So, is this as clear-cut as it may seem? Here's how Apple Intelligence on iPhone compares to using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> on Android.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gemini-vs-siri-does-ios-or-android-have-the-best-assistant"><span>Gemini vs. Siri: Does iOS or Android have the best assistant?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kwUHPFz8WXsE5EnhhQz4j8" name="Apple-Intelligence-vs-Gemini" alt="The Apple Intelligence & Siri menu beside a Pixel running Gemini." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwUHPFz8WXsE5EnhhQz4j8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Siri, the digital assistant on iPhone, is intertwined with Apple Intelligence features. It's worth noting that the revamped version of Siri teased at a prior Apple Worldwide Developers Conference hasn't actually shipped yet. By comparison, Google is in the process of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">replacing Google Assistant with Gemini</a> as Android's digital assistant of the future.</p><p>Siri and Gemini both have two different modes of interaction: voice and text. iPhone users can call up Siri with a long press of the side button, a double-tap of the gesture bar, or the wake word "Hey Siri." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Android users can access Gemini</a> with a long press of the side button or the wake word "Hey Google." As Gemini is a full-fledged chatbot, it has better access to the web and is powered by large language models for context and AI processing.</p><p>That enables unique features for Gemini that Siri can't match. While both digital assistants support text commands, only Gemini can accept file uploads for additional context. Gemini is also better at responding to basic questions in natural language, whereas Siri will frequently direct users to a search engine if it can't come up with a response.</p><p>Keep in mind that users of Siri and Gemini have reported unreliability in some use cases, like while managing device settings or controlling smart home systems. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-is-dialing-back-more-assistant-features-on-android-and-nest-devices">Gemini lacks a few core Google Assistant features</a> that were either deprecated or have not yet been added to the AI digital assistant.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gemini-live-vs-visual-intelligence-which-multimodal-ai-is-best"><span>Gemini Live vs. Visual Intelligence: Which multimodal AI is best?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DBpTh8fifHXNyQzbx6AePW" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-5" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DBpTh8fifHXNyQzbx6AePW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android users gain access to a popular multimodal AI interface called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live</a>, which is available on most Android phones across brands and generations. However, you may not know that iPhone users have a similar alternative, called Visual Intelligence.</p><p>Gemini Live <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">supports live video streaming and screen sharing</a>, while simultaneously accepting voice commands and text input. This multimodal solution allows you to share what's on your screen or in your surroundings and ask questions about it. As the "live" branding suggests, this all happens in real time, with only brief delays to account for cloud processing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vpw87wtM83SgZTReTiwuG8" name="Visual-Intelligence-2" alt="Visual Intelligence in iOS 26 on an iPhone Air." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vpw87wtM83SgZTReTiwuG8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Visual Intelligence might look similar, but it's much different. The feature functions more akin to uploading a photo to Gemini for context than using Gemini Live. With Visual Intelligence, you can snap a photo and converse with ChatGPT about it over text. Or, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">search Google for the photo using Lens</a>. Either way, Visual Intelligence doesn't support the "live" component and is limited compared to Gemini Live.</p><p>Gemini Live is the more helpful and versatile option here — I've used it for everything from tending to plants to designing apartments. The good news for iPhone users is that Gemini Live <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/hey-siri-wheres-apple-intelligence-gemini-is-now-the-top-free-app-on-ios">can also be enjoyed on iOS via the Gemini app</a>.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-magic-eraser-vs-clean-up-who-has-better-image-editing"><span>Magic Eraser vs. Clean Up: Who has better image editing?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="voRDNE9qQds8gvhTYmT6gM" name="apple-clean-up-iphone-16-pro-max-magic-eraser-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Google Magic Eraser on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Apple Clean Up on iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/voRDNE9qQds8gvhTYmT6gM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple and Google each offer their own generative editing features that leverage AI, known as Clean Up and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>. Samsung has its own, too, but we'll compare Clean Up to Magic Eraser since the latter is available on all Android phones. Google has been doing object removal and generative fill for longer than Apple, so it's better, right?</p><p>That actually might not be the case. In our latest test, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/revisiting-apple-clean-up-vs-google-magic-eraser">comparing outputs between Clean Up and Magic Eraser</a> led to mixed results. Clean Up successfully removed certain objects, like a dog's leash, in a way that looked natural and impressive. In another instance, Clean Up and Magic Eraser removed people from a photo that passed the eye test at a distance — but lacked quality up close. And in some cases, Clean Up would fail to correctly remove objects it removed just a few minutes before.</p><p>In other words, Clean Up and Magic Eraser are both less-than-stellar ways to remove unwanted people or objects from photos on an iPhone or Android device. They work in some situations and underwhelm in others. Neither is replacing Photoshop anytime soon, and thus, this battle between generative AI editors ends in a draw.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3tn6pkJubocvn8g4G4umMM" name="pixel-studio-pixel-9-pro-xl-2.jpg" alt="Pixel Studio app on Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tn6pkJubocvn8g4G4umMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond generative removal and fill, both Android and iPhone have AI image generation support. On the Android side, it'll depend on your phone manufacturer. For example, Google Pixel phones have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a>, while Samsung Galaxy phones have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a>. iPhone users get Image Playground, but all of these image generation clients are effectively the same.</p><p>They all leverage text-to-image AI models to generate photos, some of which are better than others. Generally, the model's safeguards will affect their handiness. Image Playground has strict guardrails preventing it from creating lifelike images, whereas Pixel Studio can now generate images of people.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-vs-iphone-security-and-privacy"><span>Android vs. iPhone: Security and privacy</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4KJrf2twULD4748vqe4wCJ" name="Galaxy-S25-On-Device-AI" alt="The 'process data only on device' page in Samsung settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KJrf2twULD4748vqe4wCJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Security and privacy are the one area where iPhones have the edge. Most Gemini features require cloud processing and include extensive data sharing policies. By default, your data stored by Google is retained for 18 months before being deleted. Anything that human reviewers looked at is kept for up to three years, even if you manually delete your data.</p><p>As such, you need to keep privacy at the forefront when using Gemini on Android. You wouldn't want to share anything you wouldn't be fine handing over to Google or its employees.</p><p>Apple treats Apple Intelligence differently — it processes AI tasks on-device or using its Private Cloud Compute servers. They're run using a custom operating system that is made public so independent security researchers can verify there are zero vulnerabilities. With Private Cloud Compute, not even Apple has access to your data.</p><p>The notable exception is that using ChatGPT integration will share queries with OpenAI, but you'll need to give permission every time you choose to tap into those resources.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-vs-iphone-verdict"><span>Android vs. iPhone: Verdict</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the moment, Android has the clear edge when it comes to mobile AI. Gemini is a better digital assistant than Siri, and Gemini Live blows Visual Intelligence out of the water. Image generation is a toss-up, and better security and privacy policies aren't enough to pull Apple Intelligence ahead. Apple's weak foundation models mean users will need to use external sources like ChatGPT more often, negating privacy benefits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Beware, nothing is official yet, so we don't know exactly how the Galaxy S26 Edge will look. Leaks and rumors give us a solid idea, though, so let's dive in!</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Pricing and availability </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1416px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.20%;"><img id="v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-2" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8XCVq97vxSpz8RsvsGfSZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1416" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> came about five months after the main trio of Galaxy S25 models, including the base, Plus, and Ultra versions. Samsung is said to be switching things up this year, though it's unclear exactly how. Multiple rumors claim the South Korean tech giant is axing the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus and releasing the Galaxy S26 Edge in its place. However, one recent prediction states that both the Edge and Plus models will be released in January 2026.</p><p>Either way, we expect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Edge</a> to be priced the same as its predecessor at $1,099. This will either net you 256GB or 512GB of base storage, but the former is a safe bet. There will certainly be a few color options, although we don't know what they'll be just yet.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge officially launched on May 30, 2025, priced at $1,099 for the 256GB model. It's available in Silver, Jet Black, and Icy Blue colorways. The phone has received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-the-galaxy-s25-edge-at-usd400-off-its-normal-price">major post-launch discounts</a> and isn't hard to find well under the $1,000 mark at the time of publishing.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-4" alt="The front of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge feels like an <em>honest</em> thin phone. It has a sleek design and is 5.8mm nearly all the way around, except for the smallest of rear camera bumps. Meanwhile, it's easy to see competitors like the iPhone Air as <em>cheating</em> their thinness a bit.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> in particular employs a large camera plateau to slim the body down to 5.6mm. According to the latest leaks and rumors, Samsung will take this strategy and run with it on the Galaxy S26 Edge. Current design renders show a gigantic camera island on the back that spans the upper-third section of the phone. Presumably, this will not only hold the Galaxy S26 Edge's two rear cameras but also some internal components.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Galaxy S25 Edge has a cleaner back than the iPhone Air, that'll flip with the Galaxy S26 Edge, which will likely have a camera island that's more than double the size of the iPhone's camera plateau. However, Samsung is rumored to ship the Galaxy S26 Edge with a 5.5mm thickness, partially beating the iPhone Air at its own game.</p><p>Otherwise, the Galaxy S26 Edge may look and feel much like the Galaxy S25 Edge. You can expect to see a matte titanium frame and a frosted glass back, and a few basic colorways. As for which one will look better, that'll depend on your taste. I prefer the minimalist look of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge based on early renders, but these aren't final.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1434px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.04%;"><img id="uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-1" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNMTZQPP48djvxsNSfrjRZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1434" height="818" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Moving to the display, the Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to have a similar, if not identical, screen. It'll measure around 6.7 inches, use AMOLED tech, and support 120Hz refresh rates. The current Galaxy S25 Edge offers a peak brightness rating of 2,600 nits, but this could be improved on the new model.</p><p>Keep in mind that although Samsung is using the "Edge" branding, both models will have a flat glass display.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.22%;"><img id="NEUQQEbKbj4ayGpmX98QRZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-3" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NEUQQEbKbj4ayGpmX98QRZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1426" height="816" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is already a top performer, delivering a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> chipset paired with 12GB of RAM. Still, the Galaxy S26 Edge is said to switch things up. Samsung might be moving to a dual-chip strategy with the Galaxy S26 Edge, offering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> in some regions and the Exynos 2600 in others.</p><p>Rumors also suggest that Samsung might bump the internal memory from 12GB to 16GB on the Galaxy S26 Edge. This, paired with a chip upgrade, might help the Galaxy S26 Edge perform better for gaming and on-device AI processing.</p><p>Otherwise, the key upgrades are in battery life and charging. Samsung is thought to be bumping the Galaxy S26 Edge's battery capacity to 4,200mAh, up from 3,900mAh on the Galaxy S25 Edge. This would address a crucial pain point of the Galaxy S25 Edge, which drains power quickly.

The main camera isn't rumored to get a boost this year, but that likely won't be a problem. The current Galaxy S25 Edge already has a 200MP main sensor that performs fantastically in most situations. However, the secondary 12MP ultrawide could use improvement. With the Galaxy S26 Edge, Samsung is expected to retain the 200MP primary lens, but add a 50MP ultrawide shooter.</p><p>The upgrade to the ultrawide lens will add detail to your photos while maintaining a similar expanded field-of-view. On the front, there will likely be the same 12MP, f/2.2 selfie camera with auto focus.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-should-you-wait-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Should you wait?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZZ7ebw29CUwDkre7qif2qY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-3" alt="An angled view of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZ7ebw29CUwDkre7qif2qY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a current Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge owner and user, I'd strongly recommend waiting for the Galaxy S26 Edge, with one major exception. If you need a thin phone <em>today</em> and have a tighter budget, buying a Galaxy S25 Edge now at a sweet discount — or waiting for Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales — seems to be your best option. Otherwise, hold off.</p><p>You see, the Galaxy S25 Edge has notable drawbacks. It doesn't have great battery life, the cameras could be better, and it lacks magnets. It's not even quite as thin as the iPhone Air. The great news is that Samsung plans to address all these points in the Galaxy S26 Edge, if rumors are any indication.</p><p>For me, the biggest potential Galaxy S26 Edge upgrade is the inclusion of Qi2 magnets. With thin phones, you know you're going to need a midday charge at some point. It might not be an everyday occurrence, but it will be necessary on long travel days and the like. These midday charges are painful without Qi2/MagSafe support, but with it, they're as easy as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">snapping on a power bank</a>.</p><p>That perk alone, plus all the other rumored upgrades, is reason enough to hold out for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ecc7c7ca-0859-47fd-ad69-7cd69d32a288">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UuNfEhb6YPDD2Hq8LNhJX.jpg' alt="A sample Galaxy S26 Edge render from OnLeaks and Android Headlines."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Worth waiting for</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is only a few months old, and the Galaxy S26 Edge is only a few months away.

Samsung is said to be switching things up this year, though it's unclear exactly how. Multiple rumors claim the South Korean tech giant is axing the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus and releasing the Galaxy S26 Edge in its place. However, one recent prediction states that both the Edge and Plus models will be released in January 2026.</p><p>Either way, we expect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Edge</a> to be priced the same as its predecessor at $1,099. This will either net you 256GB or 512GB of base storage, but the former is a safe bet. There will certainly be a few color options, although we don't know what they'll be just yet.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge officially launched on May 30, 2025, priced at $1,099 for the 256GB model. It's available in Silver, Jet Black, and Icy Blue colorways.

It has a sleek design and is 5.8mm nearly all the way around, except for the smallest of rear camera bumps. Meanwhile, it's easy to see competitors like the iPhone Air as <em>cheating</em> their thinness a bit.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> in particular employs a large camera plateau to slim the body down to 5.6mm. According to the latest leaks and rumors, Samsung will take this strategy and run with it on the Galaxy S26 Edge. Current design renders show a gigantic camera island on the back that spans the upper-third section of the phone. Presumably, this will not only hold the Galaxy S26 Edge's two rear cameras but also some internal components.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Galaxy S25 Edge has a cleaner back than the iPhone Air, that'll flip with the Galaxy S26 Edge, which will likely have a camera island that's more than double the size of the iPhone's camera plateau.

You can expect to see a matte titanium frame and a frosted glass back, and a few basic colorways. As for which one will look better, that'll depend on your taste.

The main camera isn't rumored to get a boost this year, but that likely won't be a problem. The current Galaxy S25 Edge already has a 200MP main sensor that performs fantastically in most situations. However, the secondary 12MP ultrawide could use improvement. With the Galaxy S26 Edge, Samsung is expected to retain the 200MP primary lens, but add a 50MP ultrawide shooter.</p><p>The upgrade to the ultrawide lens will add detail to your photos while maintaining a similar expanded field-of-view. On the front, there will likely be the same 12MP, f/2.2 selfie camera with auto focus.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-should-you-wait-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Should you wait?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZZ7ebw29CUwDkre7qif2qY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-3" alt="An angled view of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZ7ebw29CUwDkre7qif2qY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a current Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge owner and user, I'd strongly recommend waiting for the Galaxy S26 Edge, with one major exception. If you need a thin phone <em>today</em> and have a tighter budget, buying a Galaxy S25 Edge now at a sweet discount — or waiting for Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales — seems to be your best option. Otherwise, hold off.</p><p>You see, the Galaxy S25 Edge has notable drawbacks. It doesn't have great battery life, the cameras could be better, and it lacks magnets. It's not even quite as thin as the iPhone Air. The great news is that Samsung plans to address all these points in the Galaxy S26 Edge, if rumors are any indication.</p><p>For me, the biggest potential Galaxy S26 Edge upgrade is the inclusion of Qi2 magnets. With thin phones, you know you're going to need a midday charge at some point. It might not be an everyday occurrence, but it will be necessary on long travel days and the like. These midday charges are painful without Qi2/MagSafe support, but with it, they're as easy as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">snapping on a power bank</a>.</p><p>That perk alone, plus all the other rumored upgrades, is reason enough to hold out for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ecc7c7ca-0859-47fd-ad69-7cd69d32a288">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UuNfEhb6YPDD2Hq8LNhJX.jpg' alt="A sample Galaxy S26 Edge render from OnLeaks and Android Headlines."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Worth waiting for</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is only a few months old, and the Galaxy S26 Edge is only a few months away.

Samsung is said to be switching things up this year, though it's unclear exactly how. Multiple rumors claim the South Korean tech giant is axing the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus and releasing the Galaxy S26 Edge in its place. However, one recent prediction states that both the Edge and Plus models will be released in January 2026.</p><p>Either way, we expect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Edge</a> to be priced the same as its predecessor at $1,099. This will either net you 256GB or 512GB of base storage, but the former is a safe bet. There will certainly be a few color options, although we don't know what they'll be just yet.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge officially launched on May 30, 2025, priced at $1,099 for the 256GB model. It's available in Silver, Jet Black, and Icy Blue colorways.

Meanwhile, it's easy to see competitors like the iPhone Air as <em>cheating</em> their thinness a bit.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> in particular employs a large camera plateau to slim the body down to 5.6mm. According to the latest leaks and rumors, Samsung will take this strategy and run with it on the Galaxy S26 Edge. Current design renders show a gigantic camera island on the back that spans the upper-third section of the phone. Presumably, this will not only hold the Galaxy S26 Edge's two rear cameras but also some internal components.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Galaxy S25 Edge has a cleaner back than the iPhone Air, that'll flip with the Galaxy S26 Edge, which will likely have a camera island that's more than double the size of the iPhone's camera plateau.

You can expect to see a matte titanium frame and a frosted glass back, and a few basic colorways. As for which one will look better, that'll depend on your taste.

While wired charging is expected to stay the same at 25W, Samsung might add <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 magnetic support</a> on the new model.</p><div ><table><caption>Rumored specs breakdown</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Category</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge (rumored/expected)</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8.5 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+</p><p>Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO</p><p>2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+</p><p>Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO</p><p>2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide, f/1.7, 24mm, OIS, PDAF, 0.6µm</p></td><td  ><p>200MP wide, f/1.7, 24mm, OIS, PDAF, 0.6µm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 13mm, PDAF, 1.4µm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP, f/2.2, 26mm, PDAF</p></td><td  ><p>12MP, f/2.2, 26mm, PDAF</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>3,900mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W</p></td><td  ><p>25W</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 75.7 x 5.5mm</p></td><td  ><p>158.2 x 75.6 x 5.8mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>~163g</p></td><td  ><p>163g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Icyblue, Titanium Silver, Titanium Jetblack</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>We're also looking forward to an exciting camera upgrade. The main camera isn't rumored to get a boost this year, but that likely won't be a problem. The current Galaxy S25 Edge already has a 200MP main sensor that performs fantastically in most situations. However, the secondary 12MP ultrawide could use improvement. With the Galaxy S26 Edge, Samsung is expected to retain the 200MP primary lens, but add a 50MP ultrawide shooter.</p><p>The upgrade to the ultrawide lens will add detail to your photos while maintaining a similar expanded field-of-view. On the front, there will likely be the same 12MP, f/2.2 selfie camera with auto focus.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-edge-should-you-wait-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Edge: Should you wait?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZZ7ebw29CUwDkre7qif2qY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-3" alt="An angled view of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZ7ebw29CUwDkre7qif2qY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a current Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge owner and user, I'd strongly recommend waiting for the Galaxy S26 Edge, with one major exception. If you need a thin phone <em>today</em> and have a tighter budget, buying a Galaxy S25 Edge now at a sweet discount — or waiting for Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales — seems to be your best option. Otherwise, hold off.</p><p>You see, the Galaxy S25 Edge has notable drawbacks. It doesn't have great battery life, the cameras could be better, and it lacks magnets. It's not even quite as thin as the iPhone Air. The great news is that Samsung plans to address all these points in the Galaxy S26 Edge, if rumors are any indication.</p><p>For me, the biggest potential Galaxy S26 Edge upgrade is the inclusion of Qi2 magnets. With thin phones, you know you're going to need a midday charge at some point. It might not be an everyday occurrence, but it will be necessary on long travel days and the like. These midday charges are painful without Qi2/MagSafe support, but with it, they're as easy as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">snapping on a power bank</a>.</p><p>That perk alone, plus all the other rumored upgrades, is reason enough to hold out for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ecc7c7ca-0859-47fd-ad69-7cd69d32a288">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UuNfEhb6YPDD2Hq8LNhJX.jpg' alt="A sample Galaxy S26 Edge render from OnLeaks and Android Headlines."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Worth waiting for</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is only a few months old, and the Galaxy S26 Edge is only a few months away. However, the upcoming model will probably be the Edge we should've gotten the first time, with improvements to battery, charging, and cameras. It's worth waiting for if you don't need to buy a phone immediately.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="076f2787-b79c-4098-9106-f2d67091f2ab">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4R8Syy78oyWM3AN6qWAwGf.jpg' alt="Official render of the Galaxy S25 Edge"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best, for now</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge currently sets the standard for thin Android phones, packing a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip, a 200MP primary shooter, and a 6.7-inch screen. Still, there are key places for improvements we think the Galaxy S26 Edge will address.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>]]></content:encoded>

The SamMobile X account <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SamMobiles/status/1977042461315777003">posted a couple of snapshots</a> from the software, showcasing a purported design change for the pop-up Bixby bar on Galaxy. For both the light and dark mode pop-up bars, Samsung is reportedly working on giving them a rolling, gradient blue/purple glow.</p><p>More importantly, it seems Samsung is radically changing the bar's overall internal design.</p><p>Currently, the bar features Bixby's logo on the far left with a section for what you're speaking to the AI or for what you're writing (if you tap the keyboard icon on the far right).

Previously, you had to manually paste a URL into the Gemini chat to get a recap. Now, it’s baked directly into Chrome’s browsing experience. Google seems to be positioning Gemini as a more natural part of how you navigate the web, rather than a separate chatbot.</p><p>Desktop Chrome users in the U.S. have had a similar feature for a while, but this Android rollout brings parity to mobile users who prefer to browse on the go. As Google continues merging Gemini deeper into its ecosystem — from Maps and Gmail to Chrome — it’s clear the company wants its AI to feel like a built-in assistant rather than an optional add-on. With the “Summarize page” shortcut, that vision is starting to take shape right inside your mobile browser.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The money will help Oura double down on AI-driven innovation, expand its health platform, and get its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a> into more hands around the world.</p><p>CEO Tom Hale says the new funding proves how far the company’s vision of “proactive health” has come. In his words, it’s not just about tracking sleep or heart rate anymore — it’s about helping people understand their bodies, make smarter lifestyle choices, and connect data with healthcare providers.</p><p>Oura's momentum definitely backs up that vision. The company recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-soars-to-over-5-million-rings-sold-major-2024-performance">crossed 5.5 million rings sold</a>, with more than half of those shipped just in the past year. It doubled its revenue in 2024 to over $500 million, and is on track to top $1 billion in 2025.</p><h2 id="leadership-shuffle-2">Leadership shuffle</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.64%;"><img id="ZY5gyHhU4CTuG8roUSYqTC" name="Oura-Ring-4-ceramic" alt="Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZY5gyHhU4CTuG8roUSYqTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="853" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Alongside the funding news, Oura is shaking up its leadership. Longtime board member David Shuman is stepping in as chair of the board, taking over from Eurie Kim, who’s held the position since 2019.</p><p>The board is also expanding to include Wen Hsieh from Matter Venture Partners, an engineer and investor with deep hardware chops who’s expected to help guide Oura's next phase of product innovation.</p><p>And yes, the company’s still making moves on the product front. Oura recently rolled out its Oura Ring 4 Ceramic, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-unveils-stylish-ceramic-rings-and-its-first-ever-charging-case">more durable take on its flagship wearable</a>, along with the Charging Case, its first real hardware accessory. It also added Health Panels, which let users schedule lab tests and view results directly in the app.</p><p>These updates follow other software tweaks focused on sleep, readiness, and activity tracking, underscoring Oura's shift from fitness gadget to full-on health platform.</p><p>With sales and revenue climbing fast, Oura is clearly building more than just a piece of jewelry — it’s building a health ecosystem. And with nearly a billion in new funding to fuel expansion, the company’s next challenge might be more about staying ahead in a wearables market it helped redefine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The publication discovered an icon that consumers will likely find within Samsung's software when handling their earbuds' features. The discovered icon shows a singular bud with your expected in-ear tip, main body, and a redesigned stabilizer (stem).</p><p>Instead of a stem that seamlessly flows from the earbuds' main body and down, like Apple's AirPods (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">which execs didn't like</a>), the two aspects seem detached.</p><p>From the image, it looks like the stabilizer is attached to the earbud, making it look like two separate pieces, instead of one cohesive unit. Another key difference is that the stabilizer's end is rounded, unlike the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro, which resemble a triangular shape and softish corners.</p><p>The publication cites some code that directly attaches this alleged Galaxy Buds 4 illustration to the name. There was nothing mentioned about an expected Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, so it's unclear just how far this "redesign" goes. This purported change is also a little reminiscent of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-sg/products/gaming-audio/fits-true-wireless-gaming-earbuds.html">Logitech G Fits True</a> in terms of the stabilizer to the earbud.</p><h2 id="the-change-is-in-2">The change is in?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:630px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:95.24%;"><img id="r9ghobXiNuFttHZtj78jPF" name="samsung-galaxy-buds-4-redesign-one-ui-leaked" alt="A leaked illustration for the Galaxy Buds 4 shows another redesign, one that seemingly shows clear separation between the stabilizer (stem) and the model's main body." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r9ghobXiNuFttHZtj78jPF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="630" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's still a lot uncertain about this rumor; things are early, but this was found in Samsung's latest One UI 8.5 test build, so it's at least something to think about. What's also something to mull over is whether or not Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">execs are truly enforcing change</a> with its Galaxy lineup. As mentioned before, last year, when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">Galaxy Buds 3 series</a> and the Galaxy Watch 7 series launched, the company was blatantly furious with their designs.</p><p>To management, the designs were "too close" to what Apple was doing with its watches and earbuds. The MX Division's chairman, Lee Jae-yong, was reportedly "angry" about what the company had output, creating a "tense" situation. Looking at this alleged glimpse at what's to come for the base Buds 4, maybe the gears are turning in a new direction at Samsung.</p><p>Elsewhere, there was a report that the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/amid-one-ui-8-5-leaks-alleged-galaxy-buds-4-pro-testing-begins-rumor">was in the works at Samsung</a>, also through a One UI 8.5 leak. The OS' main build supposedly mentioned software testing for the next Pro earbuds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the company has previously kept some foldable devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">exclusive to South Korea</a> and China, a new report suggests that the Galaxy Z TriFold could debut in other regions as well.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-galaxy-z-trifold-wider-launch-confirmed/">SamMobile</a>, sources close to the publication claim that the Galaxy Z TriFold is on track to launch in the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), in addition to China and South Korea.

The phone is said to feature a trifolding design with three display sections connected by two hinges. It will reportedly offer a large 10-inch OLED inner display and a 6.5-inch outer cover screen.</p><h2 id="galaxy-z-trifold-might-not-be-limited-to-korea-2">Galaxy Z TriFold might not be limited to Korea</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WS82qhGTvw9GRLxfZQoZsk" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WS82qhGTvw9GRLxfZQoZsk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>, which combines inward and outward folds, Samsung's Galaxy TriFold is expected to adopt a U-shaped folding mechanism designed to protect the displays and improve durability. The device will also reportedly feature a titanium frame to enhance its build quality.</p><p>Leaks also suggest that the Galaxy TriFold will use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-trifold-battery-trifecta-in-leaked-patent-document">three-cell battery setup</a> to power its expansive display, with a combined capacity of around 5,000mAh.

What's unclear is if Samsung will follow suit with Google and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Google Pixel 10 Series</a> and finally integrate magnets into the devices to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">support Qi2 charging</a> without the need for a compatible case or ring accessory. That would at least mark a significant upgrade for those who value wireless charging.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series phones rank among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones in 2025</a>, and the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S26 series will likely snag a spot for 2026 as well. But charging speeds are one area where there could be improvements. And if the rumors are true, we won't get these with the next series.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fc89202f-1d11-4574-b79e-5cc19e6e2ed0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DfcXMYkPcazrcyA9X2i5jA.jpg' alt="samsung galaxy s25 square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A top pick in the Galaxy</strong></em></p><p>If you're looking for a new Samsung Galaxy phone, the Samsung Galaxy S25 will remain the current line for at least the next few months. Based on rumors, charging speeds won't be upgraded in the new series, so if you want to upgrade and that's a huge factor, you might not want to wait. With seven years of OS and security updates, this phone will still be current for some time.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>]]></content:encoded>
