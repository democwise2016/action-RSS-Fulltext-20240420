<p>Video editing often means choosing between heavy software or limited free tools, and I tend to yo-yo between both extreme ends of the spectrum. I’ve paid expensive subscription fees for tools like Premiere Pro and After Effects, and then also tried to make do with stripped-down editors that could barely handle transitions. So the goal was to find a sweet spot in between, something <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-video-editor-replaced-adobe-premiere/" target="_blank">powerful enough for my editing needs</a>, but also free, fast, and lightweight.</p>    <p>I came up with this setup that runs smoothly on most machines and simplifies not only the editing process but also file storage and syncing. And it doesn’t cost me anything. It’s a mix of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/browser-based-open-source-tool-covers-every-image-editing-need/" target="_blank">open-source, free, and browser-based tools</a> that can handle things like trimming and color correction, and even some audio editing. If you need something simple, free, and lightweight, this stack could cover it all.</p>    <h2>
The main video editor for bigger projects
</h2><h3>
Kdenlive covers it all
</h3>

<p>I’ve <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-kdenlive-solid-premiere-pro-alternative/" target="_blank">covered Kdenlive</a> several times because it’s one of my top free editors, and it’s at the core of this <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/built-video-editing-workflow-with-free-open-source-tools/" target="_blank">editing stack</a>. It’s completely free and open-source (there are zero paid tiers), running on a modular backend built with MLT Framework and FFmpeg. This means it can support pretty much any video or audio format you throw at it, without needing to install extra codecs or plugins. It also runs smoothly on mid-range hardware, using both CPU-based and GPU-accelerated rendering, so even high-quality projects stay responsive on modest hardware. There's also proxy editing available to enhance editing performance.</p>    <p>Despite being lightweight, Kdenlive gives me all the editing power I’m used to getting from apps like Premiere and Resolve. It has a multi-track timeline, keyframe-based animations, transitions, color correction and grading, chroma keying, speed controls, and time remapping – just to name a few. It even supports LUTs for enhanced color grading and real-time preview rendering to keep playback fluid. Plus, there’s a comprehensive audio editor to take care of the sound on your footage.</p>    <p>I spend most of my time in the Effects tab (at the top right) because it gives you so much to play around with. Although it’s not a complete replacement for motion graphics, you can definitely crank out some decent animations with it. It also has the Color tab, which is where you’ll do looks and grading. And the Audio tab is, of course, for mixing your sound and adding plugins like reverb and EQ. I’ve mainly been using Kdenlive for my shorter videos for social media, but it’s ideal for long-form content, too.</p>

A basic app to take care of the simple edits

<p> Not every video needs an advanced feature set. Sometimes I just need to make a quick cut or add a simple effect, in which case Kdenlive is overkill. This is why I wanted to add a browser-based option to my stack because they tend to be the lightest and also accessible from any device. I settled on Omniclip, a free, open-source, browser-based video editing app. And it was one of my best finds yet.</p>    <p>By far my favorite thing about it is that you get to choose the layout with the split view function, and then drag your windows around. This way, I can have the timeline at the top, the player at the bottom, and effects in the right corner. The tools aren’t comprehensive by any means, but that’s the point. I just wanted something that could split and trim my clips, and that offers a handful of effects. Omniclip also has some simple animations like slide-in effects, as well as a text feature. What surprised me, however, is that it supports 4K export. Overall, I highly recommend checking out this little editor.</p>    <p>As an aside, another basic editor I use nearly every day is the video editor inside Apple Photos on my phone. Apple’s editor is good enough to let me quickly trim a clip, change the lighting, and things of that nature.</p>

<p> Everyone’s folder structure is going to be unique to them. Some people opt for YY&gt;MM&gt;DD, others opt for alphabetical order. It completely depends on your workflow, the type of videos you edit, and also just how your brain functions. I add numbers in front of the folder names to keep them in a specific order, and also keep my folder count under ten to avoid getting overwhelmed. Above, you can see how I categorize my footage, assets, and exports.</p>    <h2>
Syncing and backup

Keeping it simple

<p> I’ve written about my top sync and backup tools in my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/replaced-note-taking-apps-with-plain-text-stack/" target="_blank">plain text stack</a> and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ditched-photo-editors-for-lightweight-editing-stack/" target="_blank">photo editing stack</a> articles, so this might be repetitive if you’ve read those. But it’s what works best for me because of how simple it is. <a href="https://snapdrop.net/" target="_blank">Snapdrop</a> is my first choice for getting footage from my phone to PC. It works similarly to AirDrop – just open the site on both devices, and pop over the files.</p>    <p>To move things between my Chromebook and PC, I use Syncthing, an open-source file syncing app. And to keep a copy of everything, I simply set my video projects folder to sync on the Google Drive app. If you prefer something more privacy-forward, I recommend Nextcloud.</p>

<h2>
It’s free and lightweight
</h2><p>The whole point of simplifying my video editing stack was to stop paying for subscriptions and reduce the load on my hardware. Kdenlive is the top alternative to Premiere because it’s free, and it’s also less demanding than DaVinci Resolve. In this process, I’ve discovered Omniclip, which was a great find for quick edits or editing on the go. My folder structure is simple to navigate, and I’m always going for the easiest route when getting my files across devices. This whole stack has saved me time, space, and money.</p>]]>

<p> Everyone’s folder structure is going to be unique to them. Some people opt for YY&gt;MM&gt;DD, others opt for alphabetical order. It completely depends on your workflow, the type of videos you edit, and also just how your brain functions. I add numbers in front of the folder names to keep them in a specific order, and also keep my folder count under ten to avoid getting overwhelmed. Above, you can see how I categorize my footage, assets, and exports.</p>    <h2>

But it’s what works best for me because of how simple it is. <a href="https://snapdrop.net/" target="_blank">Snapdrop</a> is my first choice for getting footage from my phone to PC. It works similarly to AirDrop – just open the site on both devices, and pop over the files.</p>    <p>To move things between my Chromebook and PC, I use Syncthing, an open-source file syncing app. And to keep a copy of everything, I simply set my video projects folder to sync on the Google Drive app. If you prefer something more privacy-forward, I recommend Nextcloud.</p>

<p>Video editing often means choosing between heavy software or limited free tools, and I tend to yo-yo between both extreme ends of the spectrum. I’ve paid expensive subscription fees for tools like Premiere Pro and After Effects, and then also tried to make do with stripped-down editors that could barely handle transitions. So the goal was to find a sweet spot in between, something <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-video-editor-replaced-adobe-premiere/" target="_blank">powerful enough for my editing needs</a>, but also free, fast, and lightweight.</p>    <p>I came up with this setup that runs smoothly on most machines and simplifies not only the editing process but also file storage and syncing. And it doesn’t cost me anything. It’s a mix of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/browser-based-open-source-tool-covers-every-image-editing-need/" target="_blank">open-source, free, and browser-based tools</a> that can handle things like trimming and color correction, and even some audio editing. If you need something simple, free, and lightweight, this stack could cover it all.</p>    <h2>

<p>I’ve <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-kdenlive-solid-premiere-pro-alternative/" target="_blank">covered Kdenlive</a> several times because it’s one of my top free editors, and it’s at the core of this <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/built-video-editing-workflow-with-free-open-source-tools/" target="_blank">editing stack</a>. It’s completely free and open-source (there are zero paid tiers), running on a modular backend built with MLT Framework and FFmpeg. This means it can support pretty much any video or audio format you throw at it, without needing to install extra codecs or plugins. It also runs smoothly on mid-range hardware, using both CPU-based and GPU-accelerated rendering, so even high-quality projects stay responsive on modest hardware. There's also proxy editing available to enhance editing performance.</p>    <p>Despite being lightweight, Kdenlive gives me all the editing power I’m used to getting from apps like Premiere and Resolve. It has a multi-track timeline, keyframe-based animations, transitions, color correction and grading, chroma keying, speed controls, and time remapping – just to name a few. It even supports LUTs for enhanced color grading and real-time preview rendering to keep playback fluid. Plus, there’s a comprehensive audio editor to take care of the sound on your footage.</p>    <p>I spend most of my time in the Effects tab (at the top right) because it gives you so much to play around with. Although it’s not a complete replacement for motion graphics, you can definitely crank out some decent animations with it. It also has the Color tab, which is where you’ll do looks and grading. And the Audio tab is, of course, for mixing your sound and adding plugins like reverb and EQ. I’ve mainly been using Kdenlive for my shorter videos for social media, but it’s ideal for long-form content, too.</p>

<p> Not every video needs an advanced feature set. Sometimes I just need to make a quick cut or add a simple effect, in which case Kdenlive is overkill. This is why I wanted to add a browser-based option to my stack because they tend to be the lightest and also accessible from any device. I settled on Omniclip, a free, open-source, browser-based video editing app. And it was one of my best finds yet.</p>    <p>By far my favorite thing about it is that you get to choose the layout with the split view function, and then drag your windows around. This way, I can have the timeline at the top, the player at the bottom, and effects in the right corner. The tools aren’t comprehensive by any means, but that’s the point. I just wanted something that could split and trim my clips, and that offers a handful of effects. Omniclip also has some simple animations like slide-in effects, as well as a text feature. What surprised me, however, is that it supports 4K export. Overall, I highly recommend checking out this little editor.</p>    <p>As an aside, another basic editor I use nearly every day is the video editor inside Apple Photos on my phone. Apple’s editor is good enough to let me quickly trim a clip, change the lighting, and things of that nature.</p>

<p>Okay, templates are called blueprints in Home Assistant, but the point is that the community is vast and talented, and the chances are that if I buy a new smart device, there's already a host of handy tools to use. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/actionable-notifications-home-assistant-smart-home/" target="_blank">You can add advanced functionality like actionable notifications</a>, so you get one-tap actions on the toast notification without opening the app. <span>You can also set up <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/home-assistant-blueprints-that-make-guests-think-my-house-is-magic/" target="_blank">calendar-based notifications and alerts</a>,</span> or thousands (probably) of <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/blueprints-exchange/53" target="_blank">other blueprints created by the community</a>, and that's one of the first places I search when I add a new device.</p>    <h3>
It enabled me to drop the apps of so many devices
</h3>
<p>It seemed that every time I added a new smart home device to my house, I needed another app to control them. Apps for light bulbs, apps for vacuum cleaners, apps for appliances, and more. They all cluttered up my smartphone's home screen, and it was miserable to use. For the most part, I sidestepped the issue by linking everything I could to Alexa or Home Assistant, but the integrations were never quite as powerful as the app, and I could never uninstall them.</p>    <p>With a few notable exceptions, every smart home device I own <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/replaced-all-smart-home-apps-with-home-assistant/" target="_blank">is now connected to Home Assistant</a>, and I rarely need the individual apps. What's more, I can set up automations between those devices in ways I could never have dreamed of before. Sure, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/home-assistant-automations-without-extra-hardware/" target="_blank">I don't use that many automations yet</a>, but being able to create and control them from a single tab in Home Assistant makes ongoing management simple.</p>

<p>For how powerful the operating system is, Home Assistant doesn't need much processing power to run. It's perfectly happy on a Raspberry Pi or other SBC, but I wanted a little bit more power and reliability, which <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/all-flash-mini-pc-has-replaced-my-nas-permanently/" target="_blank">led me to use the Beelink ME mini</a> as the host device for Home Assistant. This has an Intel N150 CPU, two 2.5GbE NICs, a handful of USB ports for adding a Zigbee or Z-Wave controller, and a low power consumption of 6W. That's less than most of my light bulbs, so I can keep it running 24/7 without worrying about my power bill.</p>    <p>It also runs Proxmox as the hypervisor because it's lightweight and is something that I'm familiar with using. At some point, I plan on getting two more and setting up a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/high-availability-proxmox-cluster-at-home-useful/" target="_blank">High Availability Proxmox cluster</a>, so that my smart home control will survive hardware failure. </p>    <h3>
Tons of room for activities
</h3>
<p>The six M.2 slots for NVMe storage on this mini PC is overkill for Home Assistant, which doesn't use much storage. But because I'm using Proxmox, I also run other services and operating systems on this box. Most of the installed SSDs are passed through to TrueNAS for speedy storage, but I've also got a few Linux distros and other assorted things on there. I have to be careful not to overload the CPU and the 12GB of RAM, but other than that, it's powerful enough for Home Assistant and some of my home lab experiments. </p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been dreaming of a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/built-my-own-home-automation-network-without-using-smart-home-hub/" target="_blank">unified smart home</a> since I first got a Philips Hue starter kit years ago. Then I set up the kit, and the reality of the siloed smart home sank in. My lights needed a hub to work, <em>everything</em> needed the cloud, and I could only connect the hub to a single voice assistant ecosystem at a time, severely limiting its usefulness. If you had told me all those years ago that I'd be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/built-my-own-home-automation-network-without-using-smart-home-hub/" target="_blank">running my smart home from a single dashboard</a> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/turned-old-mini-pc-into-home-assistant-hub-proxmox/" target="_blank">running on a mini PC</a>, I probably would have laughed in your face.</p>    <p>It was inconceivable back then that a home user could self-host a smart home hub, build it with the integrations, sensors, and protocols they wanted, and have it all designed to be local-first. Back then, the cloud was the hot thing, and companies wanted to reduce the complexity for the user by abstracting away all the control. But that came with a compromise on data security and privacy.</p>    <p>The other thing it enabled was a fractured smart home environment. There wasn't (and still isn't) a single company that carries a full range of smart home technology, so there's a massive market for companies that make their own dashboard and do the hard work for you. But     <span><a href="/minimal-home-assistant-automations-maximum-impact-smart-home/" target="_blank">with Home Assistant</a></span> I've made my own dashboard with a little hard work and perseverance, now running my smart home from a single mini PC. And the thing is, it's not a huge stretch for anyone else to do the same.    </p>    <h2>
Home Assistant is the smart home platform I wanted all along

It might be a little rough around the edges, but it's mine

<p>The unified smart home has long been a feature in sci-fi and popular culture, whether it's the computer in <em>Star Trek,</em> along with replicators to make a post-scarcity culture, to <em>The Jetsons</em> and the ever-dependable housekeeper, Rosie. I grew up hoping my home would be like that one day, and as the necessary technologies trickled onto the market, I became more and more excited.</p>    <p>But that excitement soon turned to disillusionment, as every smart home ecosystem seemed designed to be apart from the others, with only basic functions being able to pass the barriers. Protocols like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/matter-doubting-future-of-smart-homes/" target="_blank">Matter were supposed to fix that</a>, but it's been years since the launch, and the dream of the manufacturer-supplied unified smart home is still out of reach.</p>    <p>Home Assistant is the closest approximation of the future I was promised, and it <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/my-smart-home-is-instantly-smarter-when-i-leave/" target="_blank">makes my smart home better</a>, whether I'm in it or not. At first, I wasn't sure if it would be my solution, so <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-host-home-assistant-in-docker/" target="_blank">I had Home Assistant self-hosted in a Docker container</a> to try it out. I soon ran into the limitations of doing it that way, mainly that the add-on store wasn't available, and moved my setup to a virtual machine inside a Proxmox host on a mini PC. And it's been nothing short of fantastic so far.</p>    <h3>
Templates for success
</h3>

<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1992929180" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1992929180" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1992929180" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1992929180" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1992929180-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Okay, templates are called blueprints in Home Assistant, but the point is that the community is vast and talented, and the chances are that if I buy a new smart device, there's already a host of handy tools to use. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/actionable-notifications-home-assistant-smart-home/" target="_blank">You can add advanced functionality like actionable notifications</a>, so you get one-tap actions on the toast notification without opening the app. <span>You can also set up <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/home-assistant-blueprints-that-make-guests-think-my-house-is-magic/" target="_blank">calendar-based notifications and alerts</a>,</span> or thousands (probably) of <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/blueprints-exchange/53" target="_blank">other blueprints created by the community</a>, and that's one of the first places I search when I add a new device.</p>    <h3>
It enabled me to drop the apps of so many devices
</h3>
<p>It seemed that every time I added a new smart home device to my house, I needed another app to control them. Apps for light bulbs, apps for vacuum cleaners, apps for appliances, and more. They all cluttered up my smartphone's home screen, and it was miserable to use. For the most part, I sidestepped the issue by linking everything I could to Alexa or Home Assistant, but the integrations were never quite as powerful as the app, and I could never uninstall them.</p>    <p>With a few notable exceptions, every smart home device I own <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/replaced-all-smart-home-apps-with-home-assistant/" target="_blank">is now connected to Home Assistant</a>, and I rarely need the individual apps. What's more, I can set up automations between those devices in ways I could never have dreamed of before. Sure, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/home-assistant-automations-without-extra-hardware/" target="_blank">I don't use that many automations yet</a>, but being able to create and control them from a single tab in Home Assistant makes ongoing management simple.</p>

Home Assistant doesn't need a powerful computer to run

And I've got plenty of other virtual machines running on the same box

</div>
</div>
<p>For how powerful the operating system is, Home Assistant doesn't need much processing power to run. It's perfectly happy on a Raspberry Pi or other SBC, but I wanted a little bit more power and reliability, which <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/all-flash-mini-pc-has-replaced-my-nas-permanently/" target="_blank">led me to use the Beelink ME mini</a> as the host device for Home Assistant. This has an Intel N150 CPU, two 2.5GbE NICs, a handful of USB ports for adding a Zigbee or Z-Wave controller, and a low power consumption of 6W. That's less than most of my light bulbs, so I can keep it running 24/7 without worrying about my power bill.</p>    <p>It also runs Proxmox as the hypervisor because it's lightweight and is something that I'm familiar with using. At some point, I plan on getting two more and setting up a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/high-availability-proxmox-cluster-at-home-useful/" target="_blank">High Availability Proxmox cluster</a>, so that my smart home control will survive hardware failure. </p>    <h3>
Tons of room for activities
</h3>
<p>The six M.2 slots for NVMe storage on this mini PC is overkill for Home Assistant, which doesn't use much storage. But because I'm using Proxmox, I also run other services and operating systems on this box. Most of the installed SSDs are passed through to TrueNAS for speedy storage, but I've also got a few Linux distros and other assorted things on there. I have to be careful not to overload the CPU and the 12GB of RAM, but other than that, it's powerful enough for Home Assistant and some of my home lab experiments. </p>

All this while, I turned to in-ear monitors (IEMs) for casual listening, So when my oldest pair of Chi-fi goodness finally gave up the ghost, I saw an opportunity to replace headphones and speakers with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/iems-for-gaming/" target="_blank">gaming-focused IEMs</a>, and I wasn't disappointed.</p>    <h2>
A better class of in-ear audio gear
</h2><h3>
Even the cheap IEMs sound way better than most TWS buds
</h3>

</div>
<p>I've been a proponent of IEMs for years because they represent a phenomenal step up from the throwaway earbuds that sound as bad as how little they cost. Most of them are bass-bloated products with cheap components that wear out quickly, don't handle EQ tuning very well, and still seem to sell like hotcakes. For the same price or less, IEMs offer a giant leap ahead in sound quality, construction, and still serve several flavors of tuning which I could EQ to perfection. Most models sport resin shells with intricate designs that feel more like custom jewelry than electronics. This is a welcome departure from gaming headsets stuck in a perpetual aesthetic state of angular black plastic with aggressive RGB lighting. Most of all, I love IEMs because I can wear them in public without broadcasting my gamer status to the entire coffee shop or airport lobby.</p>    <p>With this in mind, I decided to get an affordable pair of gaming-focused IEMs to answer two burning questions I had — one, is "gaming" tacked on purely for marketing, and two, can IEMs offer a gamer the ideal middle ground between headphone-tier isolation and speaker-quality sound? To test the theory, I bought the Kinera Celest Wyvern Black Pro. Yes, the names's a mouthful, but at $30, the features surprisingly include a cable with detachable 2-pin connectors, a detachable boom mic, an inline mic, and a classic resin shell with a gorgeous faceplate. The boom mic is almost unheard of in the IEM space, and an adequate qualifier for the gaming-focused credentials in my books.</p>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p>Kinera has tuned the Wyvern to the <a href="https://headphones.com/blogs/features/the-shape-of-iems-to-come#section-3-1" target="_blank">Harman 2019 target</a>, which is a crowd-pleasing curve with punchy bass, slightly recessed mids, and a relaxed treble. This tuning is fantastic for long sessions, as it avoids the harshness and sibilance that can lead to listening fatigue. While audiophiles might chase a flatter, more analytical sound, the Harman target is just plain fun for games and music. Of course, in gaming, things like imaging, clarity, and sound separation are king. The switch to IEMs was a mixed bag in this regard, but one that ultimately worked for me, though I’ll concede it might not be for everyone.</p>    <h2>
What I liked about gaming IEMs
</h2><h3>
A sense of liberation
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="open-back 3D printed headphones propped on a rock set against a green background with sunlight filtering through" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/06/variable-openmod-headphone-3d-print-on-a-stone-proper-1.JPG?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Right off the bat, the boom mic is a great addition. In Discord calls, my friends said I sound crystal clear, a marked improvement over most muffled inline mics. Its a thoughtful nod to the needs of gamers, though the added weight pulls the right earpiece down. However, the isolation from the silicone eartips trumps everything else. A good seal melts the outside world away, and the passive noise block alone immersed me in games like typical bookshelf speakers would.</p>    <p>IEMs also decimate typical headphones in comfort with their light weight, eliminating that clamping force of your skull. I'm also thrilled I get good audio that doesn't punish me with toasty ears or pain just because I wear spectacles. With the Wyvern, you can also swap cables for added comfort if the rubbery texture going over and behind your ears feels uncomfortable. Importantly, this will cost you the prized boom mic connection, but is a worthy sacrifice that aids repairability to ensure these buds last long even if the cable snags or becomes a pet's chew toy. While I’m firmly in the camp that believes exotic cable materials do little to nothing for sound quality, the ability to swap to a balanced cable for use with a dedicated amplifier is a level of customization that most gaming headsets can't offer.</p>    <h2>
IEMs aren't the perfect solution for gaming
</h2><h3>
At least not for everyone, that is
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Frontal shot of the left earbud of the Kinera Celest Wyvern with pink key switches in the background" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/kinera-celest-wyvern-hero-2.JPG?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> It might seem concerning that I haven't mentioned the sound quality in detail yet, but that's not the main gripe with the Wyvern and its ilk. You'll hear on most gaming and audiophile forums that headphones typically offer a wider soundstage — the perceived sense of space and distance of the audio source, like footsteps, rustling grass, and gunfire in an FPS game, for instance. In theory, over-ear headphones may seem better because they engage your outer ear (the pinna), which your brain uses to interpret the directionality of sounds, creating an experience that the sound originates around you, and not inside your head and very close to your ears. It's how you detect the direction of sounds in the real world, too, and a big reason why open-back headphones sound so much like speakers.</p>    <p>IEMs seated in my ear canal bypass the pinna, and should create a more intimate sound that seems to originate close to your ears, sacrificing that spacious soundstage. In my experience, the practical difference in gaming was negligible. After all, both headphones and IEMs use the same dual speaker drivers to simulate a 3D environment. What the Wyverns lacked in expansive soundstage, they more than made up for in precision imaging and detail retrieval. Footsteps in Call of Duty: Mobile felt incredibly precise, and the subtle environmental cues in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/baldurs-gate-3-prequels-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank">Baldur's Gate 3</a> rendered with a clarity my old headset could never match.</p>    <p>The last, unglamorous downside is maintenance — cleaning out earwax buildup on the nozzles and eartips. However, it's basic sanitation that also helps the snug fit and good sound, but you don't have to worry about this side of the ownership experience with headphones.</p>    <h3>
A worthy side-grade
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Purple IEMs on a glass table with white light trails around them" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/kinera-celest-wyvern-hero-3.JPG?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Overall, the Wyvern is a great IEM that's comfortable and sounds close enough to mass-market audio gear with a V-shaped sound signature that doesn't compromise on quality. This works great for my casual listening, and light gaming with friends or just settling in for a longer session playing arcade or sim racing games like Assetto Corsa and the Forza Horizon series. For the competitive FPS player reliant on audio cues gained over the‌ years acclimatizing to a specific headset’s soundstage, over-ear headphones are still king, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-wireless-headphones-for-gaming/" target="_blank">even if you want wireless</a>. However, for almost everyone else, the benefits of comfort, isolation, portability, and classic IEM clarity are undeniable. Most importantly, $30 is a low price to find out firsthand if IEMs work for you, and the Kinera Celest Wyvern Pro is a great starting point.</p>]]>

Most of all, I love IEMs because I can wear them in public without broadcasting my gamer status to the entire coffee shop or airport lobby.</p>    <p>With this in mind, I decided to get an affordable pair of gaming-focused IEMs to answer two burning questions I had — one, is "gaming" tacked on purely for marketing, and two, can IEMs offer a gamer the ideal middle ground between headphone-tier isolation and speaker-quality sound? To test the theory, I bought the Kinera Celest Wyvern Black Pro. Yes, the names's a mouthful, but at $30, the features surprisingly include a cable with detachable 2-pin connectors, a detachable boom mic, an inline mic, and a classic resin shell with a gorgeous faceplate. The boom mic is almost unheard of in the IEM space, and an adequate qualifier for the gaming-focused credentials in my books.</p>

<p>Kinera has tuned the Wyvern to the <a href="https://headphones.com/blogs/features/the-shape-of-iems-to-come#section-3-1" target="_blank">Harman 2019 target</a>, which is a crowd-pleasing curve with punchy bass, slightly recessed mids, and a relaxed treble. This tuning is fantastic for long sessions, as it avoids the harshness and sibilance that can lead to listening fatigue. While audiophiles might chase a flatter, more analytical sound, the Harman target is just plain fun for games and music. Of course, in gaming, things like imaging, clarity, and sound separation are king.

<p> Right off the bat, the boom mic is a great addition. In Discord calls, my friends said I sound crystal clear, a marked improvement over most muffled inline mics.

<p> It might seem concerning that I haven't mentioned the sound quality in detail yet, but that's not the main gripe with the Wyvern and its ilk. You'll hear on most gaming and audiophile forums that headphones typically offer a wider soundstage — the perceived sense of space and distance of the audio source, like footsteps, rustling grass, and gunfire in an FPS game, for instance. In theory, over-ear headphones may seem better because they engage your outer ear (the pinna), which your brain uses to interpret the directionality of sounds, creating an experience that the sound originates around you, and not inside your head and very close to your ears. It's how you detect the direction of sounds in the real world, too, and a big reason why open-back headphones sound so much like speakers.</p>    <p>IEMs seated in my ear canal bypass the pinna, and should create a more intimate sound that seems to originate close to your ears, sacrificing that spacious soundstage. In my experience, the practical difference in gaming was negligible. After all, both headphones and IEMs use the same dual speaker drivers to simulate a 3D environment. What the Wyverns lacked in expansive soundstage, they more than made up for in precision imaging and detail retrieval. Footsteps in Call of Duty: Mobile felt incredibly precise, and the subtle environmental cues in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/baldurs-gate-3-prequels-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank">Baldur's Gate 3</a> rendered with a clarity my old headset could never match.</p>    <p>The last, unglamorous downside is maintenance — cleaning out earwax buildup on the nozzles and eartips.

<p> Overall, the Wyvern is a great IEM that's comfortable and sounds close enough to mass-market audio gear with a V-shaped sound signature that doesn't compromise on quality. This works great for my casual listening, and light gaming with friends or just settling in for a longer session playing arcade or sim racing games like Assetto Corsa and the Forza Horizon series.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most gamers, audio is usually a binary toss-up between headphones and speakers. Large speakers offer unrivaled immersion but are strictly for private spaces, while headphones keep audio private in shared spaces and offer clearer comms, but usually at the cost of comfort and breadth of the sound stage. Larger <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-gaming-headset/" target="_blank">gaming headphones</a> can feel like warm winter earmuffs after around an hour of intense gaming because most of them are closed-back designs that don't ventilate your ears, and cheaper Polyurethane Leather (PU Leather or Pleather) earpads only trap heat further. Yes, pricier headphones use better materials like velour and gel earpads, but strictly on a budget, I've tried <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-budget-wireless-earbuds/" target="_blank">using true-wireless earbuds too</a>.</p>    <p>TWS are the worst of the lot in audio quality terms, and latency kills what little advantage I may get with active noise cancellation. I've stuck with headphones for long, but since I wear spectacles, the seal remains imperfect and I'm always left with a dull ache behind my ears afterwards. My gaming habits lean more towards casual LAN parties and solo campaigns, and I've longed for private listening gear that doesn't leak noise, is easily repairable, doesn't cost a bomb, and sounds half-decent. I even 3D-printed my own open-back headphones for speaker-like immersion, but they leak sound. All this while, I turned to in-ear monitors (IEMs) for casual listening, So when my oldest pair of Chi-fi goodness finally gave up the ghost, I saw an opportunity to replace headphones and speakers with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/iems-for-gaming/" target="_blank">gaming-focused IEMs</a>, and I wasn't disappointed.</p>    <h2>
A better class of in-ear audio gear
</h2><h3>
Even the cheap IEMs sound way better than most TWS buds

<p>I've been a proponent of IEMs for years because they represent a phenomenal step up from the throwaway earbuds that sound as bad as how little they cost. Most of them are bass-bloated products with cheap components that wear out quickly, don't handle EQ tuning very well, and still seem to sell like hotcakes. For the same price or less, IEMs offer a giant leap ahead in sound quality, construction, and still serve several flavors of tuning which I could EQ to perfection. Most models sport resin shells with intricate designs that feel more like custom jewelry than electronics. This is a welcome departure from gaming headsets stuck in a perpetual aesthetic state of angular black plastic with aggressive RGB lighting. Most of all, I love IEMs because I can wear them in public without broadcasting my gamer status to the entire coffee shop or airport lobby.</p>    <p>With this in mind, I decided to get an affordable pair of gaming-focused IEMs to answer two burning questions I had — one, is "gaming" tacked on purely for marketing, and two, can IEMs offer a gamer the ideal middle ground between headphone-tier isolation and speaker-quality sound?

      <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/features-make-obsidian-hard-beat/" target="_blank">Obsidian is a wonderful tool</a> for creating and publishing websites, especially with the $8-per-month <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-i-use-obsidian-publish-instead-of-hugo/" target="_blank">Obsidian Publish subscription</a>. That's a low cost to host a website, especially compared to other services like GoDaddy or Bluehost, which can charge $20 or more just for the domain, much less the hosting costs. Obsidian Publish also integrates <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/game-changing-obsidian-workflows/" target="_blank">Obsidian's best features</a> into every site, such as hover previews, graph view, and more.</p>    <p>But for users on a budget, there's a better alternative. The Flowershow plugin provides a completely free alternative that makes it easy to publish your Obsidian vault. Flowershow gives you granular control over everything from the look and style of your site to the free plan's many features. There is a premium version for $50 per year that is better suited to those who need more features, but even that's less expensive than Obsidian Publish's $8 per month.</p>    <h2>
Generating a site is as simple as publishing your vault
</h2><h3>
No coding required to get started
</h3>
<div>

<img alt="A screenshot of the Flowershow interface. " src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-15-at-7-37-27-pm.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">

<p> Many people want to carve out their own slice of the web, but the idea of creating a website can be intimidating. While there are loads of tools and WYSIWYG editors, the cost typically outweighs the benefits. Flowershow lets you get up and running in just a few clicks, with step-by-step instructions that walk even total beginners through setting up a GitHub account, providing a repository template to get started, and offering in-depth guidance on customizing the site's look and feel with CSS. You can create multiple sites through Flowershow, too; you aren't limited to a single option.</p>    <p>If publishing your Obsidian vault isn't up your alley, you can also generate a website from scratch or through Markdown in your GitHub repo. There are multiple options, and a supportive Discord provides answers to more technical questions.</p>    <h2>
Your vault remains secure
</h2><h3>
Share only what you want
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A screenshot showing selective publication in Flowershow. " src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-15-at-7-38-55-pm.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</div>
<p> Flowershow is an excellent choice for vault privacy, mainly because it doesn't actually write anything locally. All it does is push files to Github, and then sync them through Flowershow cloud. In its earlier incarnations, hiding individual notes meant jumping through a few hoops, but the plugin has come a long way since then. Now it's simply a matter of clicking the button in Obsidian's sidebar and choosing the notes you want to publish.</p>    <p>When creating a site, you can choose whether to make it public or private. This is particularly useful for keeping your content private while you make edits and changes. During the build process of my own digital garden (which still isn't complete), I played around with the CSS and achieved a few results that can generously be described as "interesting." You can also fine-tune your site through its config.json file, adjusting the layout to suit your personal tastes.</p>    <h2>
Flowershow offers features Obsidian Publish doesn't
</h2><h3>
But it's also missing a few, too
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1081477289" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1081477289" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1081477289" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1081477289" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1081477289-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Due to Fowershow's CSS and JSON settings, sites are highly customizable and go beyond what users can create in Obsidian Publish. They also offer advanced blogging features, comments, author profiles, and more. You can even add in custom components with enough know-how. That said, the Obsidian graph view is restricted to Obsidian Publish, and while Flowershow does have many of Obsidian's best features (like its wiki links), it doesn't feel like a natural extension of your vault in the same way Publish does.</p>    <h2>
Flowershow requires far more technical know-how
</h2><h3>
Low barriers to entry, but a high learning curve
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A screenshot of a website with Flowershow branding at the bottom." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-15-at-7-22-46-pm.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> While I enjoy working at Flowershow and find it basically does whatever I want, it's only easy to get started with. You can quickly publish a site of your own, but customizing it and taking full advantage of Flowershow's features requires a relatively deep understanding of CSS functionality, GitHub navigation, and more. If you've never worked with GitHub or coded something in CSS, perfecting your site will take a fair bit of trial and error. And while there is a lot of documentation to help you negotiate Flowershow, it assumes a certain level of expertise that leaves out key details for absolute beginners.</p>    <p>There's another downside, too: the free tier displays specific Flowershow branding at the bottom of every page, but that disappears when you pay for the premium service.</p>    <h2>
The technicalities are worth it for the lower cost
</h2><h3>
And they present a learning opportunity
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A screenshot of someone editing the HTML for the Flowershow main page." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-15-at-7-42-10-pm.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</div>
<p> If you're completely new to web design, Flowershow presents a unique opportunity. You can design the core of your site in Obsidian, generate the content, and manage the majority of updates without ever touching GitHub. Doing so will give you a basic website. However, if you dive in and start tinkering with code, you will glean a much better understanding of how your website works, how to customize it, and much more. And that learning experience can serve as a springboard into more technical, more powerful interfaces that let you do more than either Flowershow or Obsidian Publish.</p>    <h3>
Flowershow lets you be as flowery as you want, but doesn't require it
</h3>
<p>Through Flowershow, I've planted the first seeds of a digital garden that I hope to expand in the future. I haven't yet decided on its look, and that's after hours of customizing and trying different designs. The beauty of the plugin is the ease with which I can implement different styles, but admittedly, that "ease" comes from a lot of experience. I would strongly recommend the plugin, especially since alternatives like Digital Garden aren't as well-maintained these days. Be prepared to spend a bit of time getting the hang of it. Sure, it can be a lot — but you're saving money in the end.</p>

While there are loads of tools and WYSIWYG editors, the cost typically outweighs the benefits. Flowershow lets you get up and running in just a few clicks, with step-by-step instructions that walk even total beginners through setting up a GitHub account, providing a repository template to get started, and offering in-depth guidance on customizing the site's look and feel with CSS. You can create multiple sites through Flowershow, too; you aren't limited to a single option.</p>    <p>If publishing your Obsidian vault isn't up your alley, you can also generate a website from scratch or through Markdown in your GitHub repo. There are multiple options, and a supportive Discord provides answers to more technical questions.</p>    <h2>
Your vault remains secure

<p> Flowershow is an excellent choice for vault privacy, mainly because it doesn't actually write anything locally. All it does is push files to Github, and then sync them through Flowershow cloud. In its earlier incarnations, hiding individual notes meant jumping through a few hoops, but the plugin has come a long way since then. Now it's simply a matter of clicking the button in Obsidian's sidebar and choosing the notes you want to publish.</p>    <p>When creating a site, you can choose whether to make it public or private. This is particularly useful for keeping your content private while you make edits and changes. During the build process of my own digital garden (which still isn't complete), I played around with the CSS and achieved a few results that can generously be described as "interesting." You can also fine-tune your site through its config.json file, adjusting the layout to suit your personal tastes.</p>    <h2>

<p>Due to Fowershow's CSS and JSON settings, sites are highly customizable and go beyond what users can create in Obsidian Publish. They also offer advanced blogging features, comments, author profiles, and more. You can even add in custom components with enough know-how. That said, the Obsidian graph view is restricted to Obsidian Publish, and while Flowershow does have many of Obsidian's best features (like its wiki links), it doesn't feel like a natural extension of your vault in the same way Publish does.</p>    <h2>

<p> If you're completely new to web design, Flowershow presents a unique opportunity. You can design the core of your site in Obsidian, generate the content, and manage the majority of updates without ever touching GitHub. Doing so will give you a basic website. However, if you dive in and start tinkering with code, you will glean a much better understanding of how your website works, how to customize it, and much more. And that learning experience can serve as a springboard into more technical, more powerful interfaces that let you do more than either Flowershow or Obsidian Publish.</p>    <h3>
Flowershow lets you be as flowery as you want, but doesn't require it
</h3>
<p>Through Flowershow, I've planted the first seeds of a digital garden that I hope to expand in the future. I haven't yet decided on its look, and that's after hours of customizing and trying different designs. The beauty of the plugin is the ease with which I can implement different styles, but admittedly, that "ease" comes from a lot of experience. I would strongly recommend the plugin, especially since alternatives like Digital Garden aren't as well-maintained these days. Be prepared to spend a bit of time getting the hang of it. Sure, it can be a lot — but you're saving money in the end.</p>

That's a low cost to host a website, especially compared to other services like GoDaddy or Bluehost, which can charge $20 or more just for the domain, much less the hosting costs. Obsidian Publish also integrates <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/game-changing-obsidian-workflows/" target="_blank">Obsidian's best features</a> into every site, such as hover previews, graph view, and more.</p>    <p>But for users on a budget, there's a better alternative. The Flowershow plugin provides a completely free alternative that makes it easy to publish your Obsidian vault. Flowershow gives you granular control over everything from the look and style of your site to the free plan's many features. There is a premium version for $50 per year that is better suited to those who need more features, but even that's less expensive than Obsidian Publish's $8 per month.</p>    <h2>

      <![CDATA[<p>Every PC enthusiast has heard the phrase "silicon lottery" tossed around hardware circles, usually followed up by complaints of bad overclocking headroom, or tall tales of pushing far past voltage limits of a particular chip. But what exactly does it mean?</p>    <p>This "silicon lottery" comes down to the physical characteristics of the silicon that makes up your <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/cpu-never-boosts-to-advertised-clock-speeds/" target="_blank">CPU</a> or <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/please-stop-chasing-gpu-overclocks-before-you-undervolt/" target="_blank">GPU</a>, and is often the difference maker for performance-enhancing techniques like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/6-reasons-why-most-users-should-undervolt-instead-of-overclock/" target="_blank">undervolting</a> or <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/i-tested-ram-overclocking-for-months-and-heres-what-actually-made-a-difference/" target="_blank">overclocking</a>. Here's how you can tell if you've won the silicon lottery, or if your chip is a dud.</p>    <h2>
What the "silicon lottery" actually is
</h2><h3>
Not all silicon is created equal
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1506945294" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1506945294" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1506945294" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1506945294" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1506945294-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Every CPU starts its life the same way: as a small portion of a much larger silicon wafer. This wafer is sliced into many smaller dies, and these dies are then sorted, or "binned" into different categories based on how they perform. This natural variation is known as "process deviation", and it's unavoidable in the silicon business. No two dies are going to be exactly the same, despite being manufactured with the same process.</p>    <p>The binning process is essential for CPU makers, and it's why we have different product tiers. The best silicon that turns out to be the best for any given architecture is used for the higher-end SKUs: the Core Ultra 9s and Ryzen 7s of the world. The middling stuff goes on to be a mid-range chip, and the rest are used for lower-clocking, budget chips. Each chip handles voltage and clock speed entirely differently, even within a single model, and this is where the silicon lottery comes into play. Your CPU might be more efficient, cooler, and more stable than someone else's chip of the same model.</p>    <h2>
Why it still matters today
</h2><h3>
You're playing the game every time you buy a chip
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="An image showing a Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU resting on a motherboard's CPU socket." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/ryzen-7-7800x3d-cpu.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</div>
<p> For those who are peripherally aware of the silicon lottery, you might think it only applies to those who are hardcore overclockers, but it's influential no matter who you are. A better chip within a given SKU can boost higher, hold lower voltages under load, and stay cooler than a chip from a different batch that may be slightly worse overall.</p>    <p>Take the i7-2600K for instance. Intel's Sandy Bridge was a sort of coming-of-age for its modern manufacturing process, and with that came some growing pains. These chips were beloved by the overclocking community, sometimes being able to reach 5 GHz—if you were lucky. There were pretty massive differences between the "golden ticket" chips that reached those performance heights, and the complete duds that topped out at 4.5 GHz, even with aggressive voltages.</p>    <p>This phenomenon continued into the 2010s, with notable chips being the i7-4790K and i7-8700K, but it's not limited to just Intel CPUs. On the AMD side of things, the first Zen chips were all based on the same die, with the only difference being binning. This meant that the gulf between the Ryzen 7 1700 and Ryzen 7 1800X could be bridged with some careful tuning, but that's only if you won the silicon lottery.</p>    <p>Fast-forward to today, and it's still a noteworthy phenomenon. My own Ryzen 7 7800X3D, while not able to overclock in the conventional sense, has a wildly different voltage curve than another person's 7800X3D, with some chips being able to hold significantly lower voltages while maintaining great performance.</p>    <h2>
GPUs are affected as well
</h2><h3>
The variance can be just as great
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-463360009" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-463360009" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-463360009" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-463360009" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-463360009-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The variance between GPU dies in the same SKU are notable as well, and are certainly binned on a per-SKU basis in some instances. Throughout the 2010s, overclocking was the primary way to squeeze more performance out of a card, so the silicon was binned with this in mind.</p>    <p>Every card is affected to some degree, and the proof is in the efficiency numbers. Being able to push higher clocks at lower voltages without crashing is how cards like the RX 9070 XT and RTX 3090 earned notoriety for being a lottery ticket of sorts. If you win, you can undervolt and even increase performance significantly, and if you lose, your card might only be functional at its default voltage curve.</p>    <h2>
How to tell if you've won (or lost)
</h2><h3>
It's straightforward
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A photo of a PC running Furmark" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/09/img_1062.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Both your CPU and GPU should have no problems running at stock voltages and clocks. If you're having trouble maintaining stock performance, you may be running into thermal or power limits, in which case, an upgrade may be necessary elsewhere. If all is good at stock, you can start to test the limits of your silicon by overclocking and undervolting. The level to which it can do both is generally an indicator of the quality of the silicon, and to make the most of any modern chip, a mild undervolt is generally a good idea anyway.</p>    <h3>
Don't despair if your chip can't reach great performance heights
</h3>
<p>So long as it's performing within spec, you shouldn't feel bad about the performance of your CPU or GPU. Keeping them cool and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-change-these-two-simple-settings-on-my-gpu-to-unlock-better-performance/" target="_blank">adjusting power limits</a> can go a long way to giving you a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/6-windows-performance-tricks-ive-learned-from-chasing-high-framerates/" target="_blank">few extra percent</a> of performance. If you know you want to overclock or <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/undervolting-your-gpu-can-actually-improve-performance/" target="_blank">undervolt</a> before building your system, buying a "premium" aftermarket model of GPU or stepping up one SKU within a CPU lineup can help accomplish that, but it's not guaranteed.</p>]]>

<p> For those who are peripherally aware of the silicon lottery, you might think it only applies to those who are hardcore overclockers, but it's influential no matter who you are. A better chip within a given SKU can boost higher, hold lower voltages under load, and stay cooler than a chip from a different batch that may be slightly worse overall.</p>    <p>Take the i7-2600K for instance. Intel's Sandy Bridge was a sort of coming-of-age for its modern manufacturing process, and with that came some growing pains. These chips were beloved by the overclocking community, sometimes being able to reach 5 GHz—if you were lucky. There were pretty massive differences between the "golden ticket" chips that reached those performance heights, and the complete duds that topped out at 4.5 GHz, even with aggressive voltages.</p>    <p>This phenomenon continued into the 2010s, with notable chips being the i7-4790K and i7-8700K, but it's not limited to just Intel CPUs. On the AMD side of things, the first Zen chips were all based on the same die, with the only difference being binning. This meant that the gulf between the Ryzen 7 1700 and Ryzen 7 1800X could be bridged with some careful tuning, but that's only if you won the silicon lottery.</p>    <p>Fast-forward to today, and it's still a noteworthy phenomenon. My own Ryzen 7 7800X3D, while not able to overclock in the conventional sense, has a wildly different voltage curve than another person's 7800X3D, with some chips being able to hold significantly lower voltages while maintaining great performance.</p>    <h2>

<p>The variance between GPU dies in the same SKU are notable as well, and are certainly binned on a per-SKU basis in some instances.

<p> Both your CPU and GPU should have no problems running at stock voltages and clocks. If you're having trouble maintaining stock performance, you may be running into thermal or power limits, in which case, an upgrade may be necessary elsewhere. If all is good at stock, you can start to test the limits of your silicon by overclocking and undervolting. The level to which it can do both is generally an indicator of the quality of the silicon, and to make the most of any modern chip, a mild undervolt is generally a good idea anyway.</p>    <h3>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every PC enthusiast has heard the phrase "silicon lottery" tossed around hardware circles, usually followed up by complaints of bad overclocking headroom, or tall tales of pushing far past voltage limits of a particular chip. But what exactly does it mean?</p>    <p>This "silicon lottery" comes down to the physical characteristics of the silicon that makes up your <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/cpu-never-boosts-to-advertised-clock-speeds/" target="_blank">CPU</a> or <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/please-stop-chasing-gpu-overclocks-before-you-undervolt/" target="_blank">GPU</a>, and is often the difference maker for performance-enhancing techniques like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/6-reasons-why-most-users-should-undervolt-instead-of-overclock/" target="_blank">undervolting</a> or <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/i-tested-ram-overclocking-for-months-and-heres-what-actually-made-a-difference/" target="_blank">overclocking</a>. Here's how you can tell if you've won the silicon lottery, or if your chip is a dud.</p>    <h2>
What the "silicon lottery" actually is
</h2><h3>
Not all silicon is created equal
</h3>

<p>Every CPU starts its life the same way: as a small portion of a much larger silicon wafer. This wafer is sliced into many smaller dies, and these dies are then sorted, or "binned" into different categories based on how they perform. This natural variation is known as "process deviation", and it's unavoidable in the silicon business. No two dies are going to be exactly the same, despite being manufactured with the same process.</p>    <p>The binning process is essential for CPU makers, and it's why we have different product tiers. The best silicon that turns out to be the best for any given architecture is used for the higher-end SKUs: the Core Ultra 9s and Ryzen 7s of the world. The middling stuff goes on to be a mid-range chip, and the rest are used for lower-clocking, budget chips. Each chip handles voltage and clock speed entirely differently, even within a single model, and this is where the silicon lottery comes into play. Your CPU might be more efficient, cooler, and more stable than someone else's chip of the same model.</p>    <h2>
Why it still matters today

</section><p>When I replaced the cluster with a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-wish-known-sooner-mini-pcs/" target="_blank">single mini PC</a>, the difference was immediate. It wasn’t just faster; it was easier to manage, quieter, and far more stable. I no longer had to divide my attention among five nodes or keep track of their quirks. Everything I needed now ran on one dependable machine. It was a change that improved both performance and peace of mind.</p>    <h2>
Managing one system is easier than managing five
</h2><h3>
One machine, one problem set
</h3>

</div>
</div>
<p>Each Raspberry Pi in my cluster had to be maintained separately. I had to keep operating systems up to date, containers synchronized, and configurations consistent. It wasn’t challenging, but it was repetitive and time-consuming. Every simple task took longer because I had to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/designing-graceful-failure-raspberry-pi-smarter-chasing-high-availability/" target="_blank">repeat it across multiple devices</a>. What began as a fun challenge turned into an ongoing responsibility that I never entirely escaped.</p>    <p>Switching to a single mini PC simplified everything. I only had to manage one environment, one Docker installation, and one set of backups. The time I used to spend logging into each node was cut to a fraction. I could make updates quickly and move on to more interesting projects. My home lab became something I could rely on, rather than something I had to tend to constantly.</p>    <p>I still appreciate the novelty of a working cluster and the visual charm of blinking lights, but the practicality isn’t there for daily use. A single system can deliver the same results without the constant upkeep. That simplicity makes experimentation easier and reliability far greater. The less time I spend maintaining my setup, the more I enjoy using it.</p>    <h2>
The mini PC’s performance makes a difference
</h2><h3>
More power where it matters
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Geekom Air12 Lite top view" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/07/geekom-air12-lite-top-view.jpeg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>My Geekom Air 12 Lite, equipped with an N150 processor, performs better than any stack of Raspberry Pis I have ever built, even including the Pi 5. Even though the Pis shared workloads, their combined processing power never matched that of a single x86 core. The mini PC also provides faster storage with NVMe drives and stable gigabit networking. Applications launch faster, data transfers happen instantly, and the entire system feels smoother to use. The difference is not subtle; it’s transformative.</p>    <p>That performance margin changes what I can realistically run. I can now host heavier services, such as Nextcloud, Jellyfin, and Grafana, without worrying about load averages climbing. The mini PC handles transcoding, monitoring, and databases simultaneously without complaint. It stays cool and quiet even under pressure, something my cluster could never do. Having that level of headroom means I can focus on improvement instead of resource management.</p>    <p>I used to believe that scaling with more Pis would bring more capability, but that logic never held up. Distributed systems introduce overhead, and the Arm architecture has fundamental limitations. My mini PC delivers more consistent, usable performance than any cluster I’ve tried. It’s not just stronger; it’s more reliable in every measurable way.</p>    <h2>
It’s more power-efficient than I expected
</h2><h3>
Fewer watts, more results
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1777237525" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1777237525" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1777237525" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1777237525" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1777237525-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Before I switched, I assumed the mini PC would consume much more electricity than a cluster of Raspberry Pis. I expected it to be evident on my utility bill, but the numbers told another story. The Geekom idles at eight to ten watts, roughly equivalent to two or three Pis running moderate workloads. For what it provides, that’s impressively efficient. It uses less power than I spent keeping several boards, fans, and accessories powered together.</p>    <p>The old cluster also came with hidden costs. It required a network switch, powered USB drives, and cooling for every node. Each accessory added to the overall draw and clutter. Moving to a single, compact system eliminated all those extras in a single step. The result was a cleaner workspace, lower power use, and a setup that ran cooler without compromise. My home lab finally felt efficient in every sense of the word.</p>    <p>To be fair, Raspberry Pi clusters still make sense for lightweight or educational setups. They’re great for learning distributed concepts or testing small workloads. But once you factor in accessories, cables, and downtime, the supposed efficiency advantage disappears. A single mini PC strikes a perfect balance between power and practicality, proving that simpler can also mean smarter.</p>    <h2>
x86 compatibility solves constant software headaches
</h2><h3>
No more guessing what will work
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Ubuntu MicroCloud is the Proxmox alternative you didn't know about - featured" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/ubuntu-microcloud-is-the-proxmox-alternative-you-didn-t-know-about-featured.jpeg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Running containers on Arm always brought minor but irritating issues. Some images lacked support entirely, while others behaved unpredictably or failed to display certain features. I often rebuilt containers or hunted for compatible versions just to get something running. It became part of the routine, but it shouldn’t have been. That uncertainty was one of the first things I wanted to eliminate when I rethought my setup.</p>    <p>Switching to x86 hardware solved those problems instantly. Every Docker image I rely on now runs the way its developer intended. Updates apply cleanly, dependencies resolve correctly, and behavior stays consistent across all services. I can finally experiment without worrying about compatibility gaps. The time I save from not troubleshooting broken images is worth the switch alone.</p>    <p>Virtualization is another area where the mini PC shines. I can run Proxmox and KVM natively, launching virtual machines without emulation or slowdowns. Testing a new OS no longer means tearing something down to make space. Everything runs on one cohesive platform that supports it all. The shift to x86 didn’t just improve performance; it restored the freedom to experiment confidently.</p>    <h2>
My lab feels cleaner and easier to live with
</h2><h3>
A tidy setup that works every time
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Desk with 3D printed headphones stand screensavers active" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/06/desk-with-3d-printed-headphones-stand-screensavers-active.jpeg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Even though my Raspberry Pi cluster was small, it managed to create clutter. The cables, power adapters, and switches tangled together and never stayed organized. Maintaining neatness required constant attention, and even then, it still looked like a work in progress. Replacing it all with a single mini PC brought a sense of calm to my workspace. The system is small, quiet, and barely noticeable as it runs.</p>    <p>That simplification also made backups easier. Instead of cloning SD cards for multiple boards, I use one NVMe drive with automated snapshots. Everything is centralized, easy to restore, and reliable. The new setup saves time and reduces stress, two things I didn’t realize I was missing. Maintenance has become an occasional task rather than a regular burden. It feels more like using a stable appliance than a fragile experiment.</p>    <p>I still value what I learned from building that cluster. It helped me understand distributed computing and provided me with hands-on experience with tools that I still use today. But my priorities have changed. I want my home lab to work predictably without constant attention. The mini PC gives me exactly that and feels like the natural evolution of everything I learned from the Pis.</p>    <h3>
What simplifying my lab taught me
</h3>
<p>Replacing my Raspberry Pi cluster with a single mini PC taught me that improvement doesn’t always mean expansion. Real progress sometimes comes from removing unnecessary layers and focusing on reliability. The new setup combines speed, efficiency, and simplicity in a way that makes the old cluster feel like a stepping stone. It’s a system I can depend on, one that stays quiet in the corner while everything just works. That quiet confidence is the best upgrade I could have asked for.</p>

<p>Each Raspberry Pi in my cluster had to be maintained separately. I had to keep operating systems up to date, containers synchronized, and configurations consistent.

<p>My Geekom Air 12 Lite, equipped with an N150 processor, performs better than any stack of Raspberry Pis I have ever built, even including the Pi 5. Even though the Pis shared workloads, their combined processing power never matched that of a single x86 core. The mini PC also provides faster storage with NVMe drives and stable gigabit networking. Applications launch faster, data transfers happen instantly, and the entire system feels smoother to use. The difference is not subtle; it’s transformative.</p>    <p>That performance margin changes what I can realistically run. I can now host heavier services, such as Nextcloud, Jellyfin, and Grafana, without worrying about load averages climbing. The mini PC handles transcoding, monitoring, and databases simultaneously without complaint. It stays cool and quiet even under pressure, something my cluster could never do. Having that level of headroom means I can focus on improvement instead of resource management.</p>    <p>I used to believe that scaling with more Pis would bring more capability, but that logic never held up. Distributed systems introduce overhead, and the Arm architecture has fundamental limitations. My mini PC delivers more consistent, usable performance than any cluster I’ve tried. It’s not just stronger; it’s more reliable in every measurable way.</p>    <h2>
It’s more power-efficient than I expected

<p>Before I switched, I assumed the mini PC would consume much more electricity than a cluster of Raspberry Pis. I expected it to be evident on my utility bill, but the numbers told another story. The Geekom idles at eight to ten watts, roughly equivalent to two or three Pis running moderate workloads. For what it provides, that’s impressively efficient. It uses less power than I spent keeping several boards, fans, and accessories powered together.</p>    <p>The old cluster also came with hidden costs. It required a network switch, powered USB drives, and cooling for every node. Each accessory added to the overall draw and clutter. Moving to a single, compact system eliminated all those extras in a single step. The result was a cleaner workspace, lower power use, and a setup that ran cooler without compromise. My home lab finally felt efficient in every sense of the word.</p>    <p>To be fair, Raspberry Pi clusters still make sense for lightweight or educational setups. They’re great for learning distributed concepts or testing small workloads. But once you factor in accessories, cables, and downtime, the supposed efficiency advantage disappears. A single mini PC strikes a perfect balance between power and practicality, proving that simpler can also mean smarter.</p>    <h2>

<p>Running containers on Arm always brought minor but irritating issues. Some images lacked support entirely, while others behaved unpredictably or failed to display certain features. I often rebuilt containers or hunted for compatible versions just to get something running. It became part of the routine, but it shouldn’t have been. That uncertainty was one of the first things I wanted to eliminate when I rethought my setup.</p>    <p>Switching to x86 hardware solved those problems instantly. Every Docker image I rely on now runs the way its developer intended. Updates apply cleanly, dependencies resolve correctly, and behavior stays consistent across all services. I can finally experiment without worrying about compatibility gaps. The time I save from not troubleshooting broken images is worth the switch alone.</p>    <p>Virtualization is another area where the mini PC shines. I can run Proxmox and KVM natively, launching virtual machines without emulation or slowdowns. Testing a new OS no longer means tearing something down to make space. Everything runs on one cohesive platform that supports it all. The shift to x86 didn’t just improve performance; it restored the freedom to experiment confidently.</p>    <h2>

<p>Even though my Raspberry Pi cluster was small, it managed to create clutter. The cables, power adapters, and switches tangled together and never stayed organized. Maintaining neatness required constant attention, and even then, it still looked like a work in progress. Replacing it all with a single mini PC brought a sense of calm to my workspace. The system is small, quiet, and barely noticeable as it runs.</p>    <p>That simplification also made backups easier. Instead of cloning SD cards for multiple boards, I use one NVMe drive with automated snapshots. Everything is centralized, easy to restore, and reliable. The new setup saves time and reduces stress, two things I didn’t realize I was missing. Maintenance has become an occasional task rather than a regular burden. It feels more like using a stable appliance than a fragile experiment.</p>    <p>I still value what I learned from building that cluster. It helped me understand distributed computing and provided me with hands-on experience with tools that I still use today. But my priorities have changed. I want my home lab to work predictably without constant attention. The mini PC gives me exactly that and feels like the natural evolution of everything I learned from the Pis.</p>    <h3>

<p>Replacing my Raspberry Pi cluster with a single mini PC taught me that improvement doesn’t always mean expansion. Real progress sometimes comes from removing unnecessary layers and focusing on reliability.

Each small board carried its share of the load, and I enjoyed seeing them work together. The soft hum of fans and the glow of LEDs made it feel like a miniature data center. Over time, however, the routine of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/built-pi-powered-kubernetes-cluster/" target="_blank">maintaining multiple systems</a> began to feel more like a burden than a hobby.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Most productivity apps ask you to choose your poison: Notion for docs, Asana for tasks, and Zapier for automation. You're paying $15 here, $25 there, and suddenly your "productivity" budget hits $100+ monthly.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, ClickUp's free tier is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/productivity-suites-youve-probably-overlooked-and-might-suit-you-better/" target="_blank">one of the most overlooked productivity suites</a> and quietly includes all of that — tasks, docs, goals, calendars, real-time collaboration, and automation — without charging you a cent. It's the Swiss Army knife of project management, except someone forgot to tell people it exists, and the ones who find it often drown in its 50+ features before discovering its power.</p>    <p>I once moved a client off a Notion-Asana hybrid setup they'd been clinging to for years. The breaking point? They were hitting Notion's block limits, and Asana's free plan wouldn't let them use timeline views. ClickUp's free plan offered both, plus features they didn't even know they needed. ClickUp's biggest strength is also its biggest weakness. The sheer density of features creates analysis paralysis. My job became less about showing them what ClickUp could do and more about showing them what to ignore.</p>

Too many features create decision fatigue

<p>Here’s where ClickUp <em>used to </em>shoot itself in the foot: onboarding. For a long time, first-time users were dropped into a cockpit full of switches — asked to choose between endless task views, configure automations they didn’t understand yet, and pick from templates ranging from “Simple To-Do” to “Agile Sprint with Scrum Boards.” For someone leaving Todoist or Trello, it felt like going from a bicycle to a fighter jet. You could fly it, sure, but only after figuring out which buttons <em>not </em>to press.</p>    <p>Thankfully, ClickUp’s onboarding has come a long way. It now walks you through setup by asking which features you actually want to use, offers optional tutorials, and breaks down the interface into smaller, more digestible steps. It’s still a “learn-as-you-go” platform at heart, but at least you’re not thrown into the deep end without a map.</p>    <p>ClickUp still isn’t bloated, but it refuses to hide complexity by default. Every feature is surfaced, and the interface assumes you know what “dependencies,” “subtasks,” and “custom statuses” mean. Notion suffers from this too, but its minimalist aesthetic tricks you into thinking it’s simple. ClickUp’s UI, by contrast, is dense, utilitarian, and overwhelming. The first time I opened my client’s workspace, I counted 47 buttons in the left sidebar. Forty-seven.</p>    <p>The platform's design philosophy still leans “give power users everything,” which can alienate beginners. The irony? Once you strip ClickUp down to 20% of its features, it’s cleaner and faster than Notion or Asana. But getting there still takes discipline.</p>    <h2>
A minimal ClickUp setup that actually works
</h2><h3>
Start with three views and resist adding more
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Asana list view example" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/list-view.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Here's the pared-down ClickUp workspace I usually build, and it's what I recommend to anyone starting fresh. You don't need 50 features from the get-go. You need three:</p>        <ol>
<li>
<strong>Tasks (List View):</strong> This is your inbox. Every project lives here as a list, and every task gets a due date, assignee, and status (To Do, In Progress, Done). That's it. No custom fields. No priority flags. No tags. Not yet. The goal is to get tasks out of your head and into a system you'll actually check. ClickUp's list view works like Asana's but loads faster and doesn't hit a paywall when you add a sixth team member.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Content Calendar (Calendar View)</strong>: This is where ClickUp starts flexing. Instead of paying for CoSchedule or Loomly, you can drag tasks with due dates onto ClickUp's calendar view and see your entire month at a glance. My client used this to plan blog posts, social media deadlines, and campaign launches. You can color-code by project, filter by assignee, and drag-and-drop to reschedule. It's not as polished as Motion or Akiflow, but it's free and integrated with your task list, so there's no syncing lag.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Project Timelines (Gantt or Timeline View)</strong>: For tracking progress over time, ClickUp’s Gantt and Timeline views do the job beautifully. They let you visualize dependencies, milestones, and overlapping deadlines at a single glance — perfect for teams juggling multiple campaigns or phases. I recommend Gantt if you prefer a traditional project management feel, or Timeline if you want something simpler and more linear. Both let you see how tasks connect to broader goals without needing a separate OKR or goal-tracking tool.
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's the setup. Three views, zero dollars, and it replaced Asana, Notion, and CoSchedule. The key is resisting ClickUp's constant upselling of features you don't need yet. Turn off notifications for subtask comments. Ignore the "Try Automations!" prompts. Disable inbox views if you're not using them. ClickUp lets you hide almost everything, but you have to manually opt out, which is exhausting.</p>    <h2>
Where the free plan actually limits you
</h2><h3>
Storage caps and automation quotas bite faster than you'd think
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of ClickUp AI feature" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/clickup-ai.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>ClickUp’s free plan isn’t infinite. You get 60MB of storage, which sounds fine until you start attaching design files, PDFs, or screenshots to tasks. My client hit the limit in two months because they were uploading mockups directly into ClickUp instead of linking to Figma or Google Drive. The workaround is obvious—use ClickUp for task management and store files externally—but it’s a friction point for some.</p>    <p>You also get limited automations (five active automations with 100 actions per month). For context, an “action” is triggered every time an automation runs. If you set up a rule like “When status changes to Done, notify the team,” that’s one action per completed task. A hundred actions sound generous until you’re closing 20 tasks a week, and suddenly you’ve burned through your quota.</p>    <p>Then there’s ClickUp AI. It’s impressive (especially the AI note taker and writing assistant), but on the free plan, you’re capped at 500 usage credits. That’s enough for light use, but if you’re in back-to-back meetings or rely on AI for summaries and task notes, you’ll run out quickly. You’ll either need to upgrade or go back to manual note-taking once your credits expire.</p>    <p>Finally, the integration cap. ClickUp’s free plan supports the basics (Google Calendar, Slack, Zoom), but native two-way syncing with tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, or GitHub requires a paid plan. If your workflow depends on heavy CRM or dev tool integration, you’ll hit this wall fast.</p>    <h2>
Who does this actually work for

<p> ClickUp's free plan is perfect for freelancers, small agencies (under 10 people), and scrappy startups who need a single source of truth without paying SaaS rent. If you're currently juggling Notion for docs, Trello for tasks, and Google Sheets for tracking, ClickUp consolidates all of that. You'll spend a weekend configuring it, but then you're done. No more context-switching between apps. No more, "Which tool did I write that note in?"</p>    <p>It's also great for people who are almost ready to pay for Asana or Monday.com but want to test-drive a full-featured PM tool first. ClickUp's free plan lets you explore advanced workflows — dependencies, sprints, workload views — without committing $10+/user. If you outgrow it, upgrading is seamless.</p>    <p>But it's not for everyone. If you value aesthetic minimalism (Notion, Things 3), ClickUp will feel cluttered. If you need hand-holding onboarding (Asana, Trello), ClickUp will frustrate you. And if you're managing a 50-person team with complex reporting needs, you'll hit the free plan's ceilings fast. ClickUp is for people who want power and are willing to wrestle with complexity to get it.</p>    <h3>
The real cost is set up time and not the subscription fees
</h3>
<p>ClickUp's free plan gives you $100/month worth of features, but extracting that value requires intentional setup. You can't just sign up and start clicking. You need to decide which 20% of ClickUp you'll use, hide the rest, and resist the urge to over-engineer your workflow.</p>    <p>If you can do that, ClickUp is the best free productivity tool on the market. If you can't, you'll spend three weeks tweaking custom fields and never actually finish a task. The features are free, but your time isn't.</p>]]>

Where ClickUp's free plan actually competes
</h2><h3>
It replaces tools you're already paying for
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1681209959" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1681209959" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1681209959" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1681209959" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1681209959-img" data-gallery-type="">

</div>
<p>Let's break down what you actually get on ClickUp's free forever plan, because the marketing page undersells it. You're not just getting "unlimited tasks." You're getting a full-featured workspace with:</p>        <ul>
<li>
Unlimited tasks
</li>
<li>
Unlimited members with real-time collaboration
</li>
<li>
60MB storage
</li>
<li>
2FA
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-open-source-kanban-app-takes-project-management-next-level/" target="_blank">Kanban boards</a>
</li>
<li>
Calendar views, list views, Gantt views (called Timeline view)
</li>
<li>
Native time tracking and goals with progress tracking
</li>
<li>
Customizable task statuses
</li>
</ul>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>If you’re managing a lot of docs, you can create ones with nested pages and real-time editing — basically Notion's editor, minus the databases.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Compare that to Asana's free plan, which caps you at 10 teammates and locks timeline views behind a $10.99/user/month paywall. Or Notion, which limits you to one collaborative workspace and starts charging at $10/seat once you add a second person. Trello's free tier gives you 10 boards and then asks for your credit card.</p>    <p>ClickUp doesn't paywall the basics. The free plan is shockingly generous because ClickUp's monetization model assumes you'll eventually need advanced reporting, custom fields at scale, or priority support — but most small teams won't hit those ceilings for months, if ever.</p>    <p>I've watched teams operate for six months on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/manage-projects-clickup-how-use-it/" target="_blank">ClickUp's free project management plan</a> without friction. The limit isn't the features. It’s about resisting the urge to turn every workflow into a science project.</p>    <h2>
The paradox of choice problem
</h2><h3>
Too many features create decision fatigue
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1675992603" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1675992603" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1675992603" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1675992603" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1675992603-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Here’s where ClickUp <em>used to </em>shoot itself in the foot: onboarding. For a long time, first-time users were dropped into a cockpit full of switches — asked to choose between endless task views, configure automations they didn’t understand yet, and pick from templates ranging from “Simple To-Do” to “Agile Sprint with Scrum Boards.” For someone leaving Todoist or Trello, it felt like going from a bicycle to a fighter jet. You could fly it, sure, but only after figuring out which buttons <em>not </em>to press.</p>    <p>Thankfully, ClickUp’s onboarding has come a long way. It now walks you through setup by asking which features you actually want to use, offers optional tutorials, and breaks down the interface into smaller, more digestible steps. It’s still a “learn-as-you-go” platform at heart, but at least you’re not thrown into the deep end without a map.</p>    <p>ClickUp still isn’t bloated, but it refuses to hide complexity by default. Every feature is surfaced, and the interface assumes you know what “dependencies,” “subtasks,” and “custom statuses” mean. Notion suffers from this too, but its minimalist aesthetic tricks you into thinking it’s simple. ClickUp’s UI, by contrast, is dense, utilitarian, and overwhelming. The first time I opened my client’s workspace, I counted 47 buttons in the left sidebar. Forty-seven.</p>    <p>The platform's design philosophy still leans “give power users everything,” which can alienate beginners. The irony? Once you strip ClickUp down to 20% of its features, it’s cleaner and faster than Notion or Asana. But getting there still takes discipline.</p>    <h2>
A minimal ClickUp setup that actually works
</h2><h3>
Start with three views and resist adding more
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Asana list view example" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/list-view.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Here's the pared-down ClickUp workspace I usually build, and it's what I recommend to anyone starting fresh. You don't need 50 features from the get-go. You need three:</p>        <ol>
<li>
<strong>Tasks (List View):</strong> This is your inbox. Every project lives here as a list, and every task gets a due date, assignee, and status (To Do, In Progress, Done). That's it. No custom fields. No priority flags. No tags. Not yet. The goal is to get tasks out of your head and into a system you'll actually check. ClickUp's list view works like Asana's but loads faster and doesn't hit a paywall when you add a sixth team member.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Content Calendar (Calendar View)</strong>: This is where ClickUp starts flexing. Instead of paying for CoSchedule or Loomly, you can drag tasks with due dates onto ClickUp's calendar view and see your entire month at a glance. My client used this to plan blog posts, social media deadlines, and campaign launches. You can color-code by project, filter by assignee, and drag-and-drop to reschedule. It's not as polished as Motion or Akiflow, but it's free and integrated with your task list, so there's no syncing lag.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Project Timelines (Gantt or Timeline View)</strong>: For tracking progress over time, ClickUp’s Gantt and Timeline views do the job beautifully. They let you visualize dependencies, milestones, and overlapping deadlines at a single glance — perfect for teams juggling multiple campaigns or phases. I recommend Gantt if you prefer a traditional project management feel, or Timeline if you want something simpler and more linear. Both let you see how tasks connect to broader goals without needing a separate OKR or goal-tracking tool.
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's the setup. Three views, zero dollars, and it replaced Asana, Notion, and CoSchedule. The key is resisting ClickUp's constant upselling of features you don't need yet. Turn off notifications for subtask comments. Ignore the "Try Automations!" prompts. Disable inbox views if you're not using them. ClickUp lets you hide almost everything, but you have to manually opt out, which is exhausting.</p>    <h2>
Where the free plan actually limits you
</h2><h3>
Storage caps and automation quotas bite faster than you'd think
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of ClickUp AI feature" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/clickup-ai.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>ClickUp’s free plan isn’t infinite. You get 60MB of storage, which sounds fine until you start attaching design files, PDFs, or screenshots to tasks. My client hit the limit in two months because they were uploading mockups directly into ClickUp instead of linking to Figma or Google Drive. The workaround is obvious—use ClickUp for task management and store files externally—but it’s a friction point for some.</p>    <p>You also get limited automations (five active automations with 100 actions per month). For context, an “action” is triggered every time an automation runs. If you set up a rule like “When status changes to Done, notify the team,” that’s one action per completed task. A hundred actions sound generous until you’re closing 20 tasks a week, and suddenly you’ve burned through your quota.</p>    <p>Then there’s ClickUp AI. It’s impressive (especially the AI note taker and writing assistant), but on the free plan, you’re capped at 500 usage credits. That’s enough for light use, but if you’re in back-to-back meetings or rely on AI for summaries and task notes, you’ll run out quickly. You’ll either need to upgrade or go back to manual note-taking once your credits expire.</p>    <p>Finally, the integration cap. ClickUp’s free plan supports the basics (Google Calendar, Slack, Zoom), but native two-way syncing with tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, or GitHub requires a paid plan. If your workflow depends on heavy CRM or dev tool integration, you’ll hit this wall fast.</p>    <h2>
Who does this actually work for
</h2><h3>
Small teams and solopreneurs who need to move fast
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of ClickUp member space" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/clickup-members.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> ClickUp's free plan is perfect for freelancers, small agencies (under 10 people), and scrappy startups who need a single source of truth without paying SaaS rent. If you're currently juggling Notion for docs, Trello for tasks, and Google Sheets for tracking, ClickUp consolidates all of that. You'll spend a weekend configuring it, but then you're done. No more context-switching between apps. No more, "Which tool did I write that note in?"</p>    <p>It's also great for people who are almost ready to pay for Asana or Monday.com but want to test-drive a full-featured PM tool first. ClickUp's free plan lets you explore advanced workflows — dependencies, sprints, workload views — without committing $10+/user. If you outgrow it, upgrading is seamless.</p>    <p>But it's not for everyone. If you value aesthetic minimalism (Notion, Things 3), ClickUp will feel cluttered. If you need hand-holding onboarding (Asana, Trello), ClickUp will frustrate you. And if you're managing a 50-person team with complex reporting needs, you'll hit the free plan's ceilings fast. ClickUp is for people who want power and are willing to wrestle with complexity to get it.</p>    <h3>
The real cost is set up time and not the subscription fees
</h3>
<p>ClickUp's free plan gives you $100/month worth of features, but extracting that value requires intentional setup. You can't just sign up and start clicking. You need to decide which 20% of ClickUp you'll use, hide the rest, and resist the urge to over-engineer your workflow.</p>    <p>If you can do that, ClickUp is the best free productivity tool on the market. If you can't, you'll spend three weeks tweaking custom fields and never actually finish a task. The features are free, but your time isn't.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <itunes:summary>
      <![CDATA[<p>It's a good day if you're into puzzle games. A little while ago, I reported that Chants of Sannaar, which holds a spot in my pantheon of "favorite puzzle games ever," was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/my-favorite-puzzle-games-ever-40-off-steam/" target="_blank">discounted as part of a Steam sale</a>. Now, <em>another</em> one from that pantheon, Return of the Obra Dinn, has just gone on sale. It's <span>as if someone at Valve has both a love for puzzle games <em>and</em> impeccable</span> taste.</p>    <h2>
Return of the Obra Dinn is 50% off on Steam right now
</h2>
<p>Return of the Obra Dinn follows your average detective-style gameplay. People have died, and you need to figure out how they were taken out and who did the deed, if anyone. However, there's a catch: all the deaths happened five years ago, and all that remains are the skeletons of the crew and some scraps.</p>    <p>Fortunately, you have a watch that allows you to see the exact moment when someone died, as if it were a freeze frame. From here, you can see who attacked whom, who was skulking in the shadows, and even further clues into the fate of the crew.</p>    <p>Once you figure it out, you log the cause of death and the attacker, if any, in your book. Once you've gotten a trio of the crew correct, the game will lock them in. Your objective is to get your entire book filled out so you can file your findings to an insurance company.</p>    <p>Here's the Steam page listing:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>In 1802, the merchant ship <em>Obra Dinn</em> set out from London for the Orient with over 200 tons of trade goods. Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea.</p>
<p>Early this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port at Falmouth with damaged sails and no visible crew. As insurance investigator for the East India Company's London Office, dispatch immediately to Falmouth, find means to board the ship, and prepare an assessment of damages.</p>
<p><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> is a first-person mystery adventure based on exploration and logical deduction.</p>
</blockquote><p>Right now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/" target="_blank">Return of the Obra Dinn is 50% off on Steam</a> until October 23rd, selling for a very reasonable $10. It's the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/653530/" target="_blank">lowest the game has ever been on Steam</a>, beating its previous 40% discount record. And if you need more convincing, we named it <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/indie-games-play-least-once-your-life/" target="_blank">one of the best indie games that everyone should play once in their lives</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>It's a good day if you're into puzzle games. A little while ago, I reported that Chants of Sannaar, which holds a spot in my pantheon of "favorite puzzle games ever," was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/my-favorite-puzzle-games-ever-40-off-steam/" target="_blank">discounted as part of a Steam sale</a>. Now, <em>another</em> one from that pantheon, Return of the Obra Dinn, has just gone on sale. It's <span>as if someone at Valve has both a love for puzzle games <em>and</em> impeccable</span> taste.</p>    <h2>
Return of the Obra Dinn is 50% off on Steam right now
</h2>
<p>Return of the Obra Dinn follows your average detective-style gameplay. People have died, and you need to figure out how they were taken out and who did the deed, if anyone. However, there's a catch: all the deaths happened five years ago, and all that remains are the skeletons of the crew and some scraps.</p>    <p>Fortunately, you have a watch that allows you to see the exact moment when someone died, as if it were a freeze frame. From here, you can see who attacked whom, who was skulking in the shadows, and even further clues into the fate of the crew.</p>    <p>Once you figure it out, you log the cause of death and the attacker, if any, in your book. Once you've gotten a trio of the crew correct, the game will lock them in. Your objective is to get your entire book filled out so you can file your findings to an insurance company.</p>    <p>Here's the Steam page listing:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>In 1802, the merchant ship <em>Obra Dinn</em> set out from London for the Orient with over 200 tons of trade goods. Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea.</p>
<p>Early this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port at Falmouth with damaged sails and no visible crew. As insurance investigator for the East India Company's London Office, dispatch immediately to Falmouth, find means to board the ship, and prepare an assessment of damages.</p>
<p><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> is a first-person mystery adventure based on exploration and logical deduction.</p>
</blockquote><p>Right now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/" target="_blank">Return of the Obra Dinn is 50% off on Steam</a> until October 23rd, selling for a very reasonable $10. It's the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/653530/" target="_blank">lowest the game has ever been on Steam</a>, beating its previous 40% discount record. And if you need more convincing, we named it <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/indie-games-play-least-once-your-life/" target="_blank">one of the best indie games that everyone should play once in their lives</a>.</p>

</section><p>While we've only just waved goodbye to Windows 10's feature updates, Windows 11 continues as normal. After all, with Windows 11 now being the only operating system Microsoft supports with anything more than security updates, it needs to keep things fresh and exciting for its users.</p>    <p>In fact, I'd argue that it has to make things as comfortable for former Windows 10 users as possible, as keeping them bereft of the features they've come to know and love may encourage them to switch to another operating system instead of sticking with Windows 11. Fortunately, it seems Microsoft is in the same boat as me, as it's finally fixing one of the more annoying issues of using Windows 11 on a dual-screen setup.</p>    <h2>
Microsoft finally allows Windows 11 users to open the Notification Center on either monitor
</h2>

<p>Over on the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/10/16/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-27972-canary-channel/" target="_blank">Windows Insider blog</a>, Microsoft shares the patch notes for its newest Windows 11 update. It's currently on the Canary channel, which is the very first round of public testing before the patch arrives on the Beta, Dev, and Release preview channels. As such, we won't see this update on the release branch for a little while, but it's making its way over at the very least.</p>    <p>There isn't a ton of additions for Preview Build 27971, but the highlight feature is the addition of the Notification Center on secondary monitors. This means you can see the time and date on either of your monitors, and Microsoft notes that this includes the new feature that adds a clock with seconds above the calendar. Also, it appears the patch fixes that weird box that's causing protected content from playing. </p>    <p>One tweak actually addresses an issue that Canary users experienced with earlier patches. If you're on the Canary branch and File Explorer keeps crashing when you move things onto a network drive, this update should fix that.</p>    <p>Here are the full notes:</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><h3>
<strong>[Notification Center]</strong>
</h3>
</div>
<div>    <ul>

      <![CDATA[<p>I'm old-school and take most of my notes by hand, but I hate re-typing them into a note-taking app later. Thankfully, I've stumbled across a solution that not only handles most of the tedium for me but also saves me a lot of money on paper: a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tech-products-under-100-back-to-school/" target="_blank">combination of Rocketbook </a>and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/finally-started-using-obsidian-should-have-sooner/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>. I take my notes in Rocketbook, a reusable notebook with a FriXion pen that can easily be erased. When I scan the page, it's automatically uploaded <span>to my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/using-icloud-on-windows-doesnt-need-to-be-a-nightmare/" target="_blank">iCloud drive</a> and then to</span> Obsidian. There are other ways of doing this — in fact, setting up the entire system in Google Drive would likely be easier — but since I already use iCloud as a backup solution, this slots into my day-to-day workflow much more easily.</p>    <p>The setup process is a bit of a pain. It's not too complicated, but there are more steps than there need to be for something like this. Don't worry, though; all you iOS users in the same boat as me will find an easy solution to a problem that really should have already been solved with an Obsidian plugin. Seriously: why isn't there better Rocketbook integration already?</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>The root of this entire problem lies in iCloud. It creates a dedicated subfolder named after any third-party app, which makes access tricky. As a result of this, rather than syncing Rocketbook uploads directly into my Obsidian folder, I have to use an automation to move uploads.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><h2>
How to automatically transfer Rocketbook files into Obsidian
</h2><p>Due to iCloud's eccentricities with third-party applications, there are two main folders that come into play here. The first is the Rocketbook folder, created by the Rocketbook app itself. The second is my Obsidian folder, which contains multiple subfolders — one for each of my vaults. In this particular circumstance, I need the files from the Rocketbook folder to move into the correct Obsidian vault subfolder. Sounds complicated, right? It could be worse. I'd rate this setup as medium difficulty, so let's get started.</p>    <h3>
Set up the correct Rocketbook destination
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Open <strong>Rocketbook</strong> on your <strong>iOS</strong> device.
</li>
<li>
Tap <strong>Destinations</strong> in the bottom-right corner.
</li>
<li>
By default, the destination will be <strong>Email</strong>. Tap <strong>Change Destination</strong> -<strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>iCloud</strong> -<strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Create New Folder</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Name the folder.
</li>
<li>
Tap <strong>Save</strong> in the upper-right corner.
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<div><div><div data-img-unique-id="1-342447096" data-img-class="gallery-1-images-1751554233" data-gallery-modal-id="gallery-modal-1-880742842" data-gallery-slides-container-id="gallery-modal-1-slides-container-693835750"><div><div><img alt="A screenshot of someone setting a destination in the Rocketbook app." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/img_7308.PNG?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;dpr=2"></div></div></div><div data-img-unique-id="1-476224677" data-img-class="gallery-1-images-1751554233" data-gallery-modal-id="gallery-modal-1-880742842" data-gallery-slides-container-id="gallery-modal-1-slides-container-693835750"><div><div><img alt="A screenshot of the various Destinations available in the Rocketbook app. " src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/img_7309.PNG?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;dpr=2"></div></div></div><div data-img-unique-id="1-1665206384" data-img-class="gallery-1-images-1751554233" data-gallery-modal-id="gallery-modal-1-880742842" data-gallery-slides-container-id="gallery-modal-1-slides-container-693835750"><div><div><img alt="A screenshot of Rocketbook with iCloud set as the destination.

</div>
<p>Once you've set up your iCloud folder as the destination, you can quickly select it anytime you scan in a new note, and it will send the file straight there. Now, we can move on to creating the automation.</p>    <h3>
Set up the file automation
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Open <strong>Shortcuts</strong> on your iOS device.
</li>
<li>
Tap the <strong>Automation</strong> button in the bottom-center of the screen.
</li>
<li>
Tap <strong>New Automation.</strong>
</li>
<li>
This opens a menu that allows you to select the trigger that runs in the automation. Scroll down and select <strong>App.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Tap<strong> App -&gt; Rocketbook -&gt; Done.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Disable the toggle for <strong>Is Open</strong> and tap <strong>Is Closed</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Tap <strong>Run Immediately -&gt;</strong> <strong>Next.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Tap New Blank Automation.
</li>
<li>
Search for <strong>Get Contents of Folder</strong> and tap the light-blue <strong>Folder</strong> text beneath it, then select the <strong>Rocketbook folder</strong> you named earlier.
</li>
<li>
Search your actions again for <strong>Move </strong><strong>File</strong>. It will automatically populate the initial field with <strong>Get Contents of Folder</strong>, but you will need to tap <strong>Shortcuts</strong>, the default selection, and instead choose the folder for your Obsidian vault. In my case, I have a dedicated folder for Rocketbook uploads, but you can choose to send the files to your primary vault instead.
</li>
<li>
Tap <strong>Done.</strong>
</li>
</ol>

</div>
<p>And with that, voilà: any file you upload to Rocketbook will automatically appear in your Obsidian vault as soon as you close the application. The reason I have it set to activate upon closing is that it allows me to move multiple notes at once.</p>    <h2>
It's convenient, and it saves the trees
</h2><p>As I said earlier, I take a lot of notes — but I always felt bad jotting things down that would be tossed later. It felt like a waste of paper. With the Rocketbook, I can take as many notes as I want and simply clean the page off later with a damp cloth. As long as I scan the notes with the Rocketbook app — a process that takes seconds — then they're preserved in a digital format for posterity. And when it comes to notes I don't need to keep, like calculations or random scribbles? I can easily erase those, and deletion is as simple as tapping an icon if one does accidentally get uploaded.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm old-school and take most of my notes by hand, but I hate re-typing them into a note-taking app later. Thankfully, I've stumbled across a solution that not only handles most of the tedium for me but also saves me a lot of money on paper: a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tech-products-under-100-back-to-school/" target="_blank">combination of Rocketbook </a>and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/finally-started-using-obsidian-should-have-sooner/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>. I take my notes in Rocketbook, a reusable notebook with a FriXion pen that can easily be erased. When I scan the page, it's automatically uploaded <span>to my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/using-icloud-on-windows-doesnt-need-to-be-a-nightmare/" target="_blank">iCloud drive</a> and then to</span> Obsidian. There are other ways of doing this — in fact, setting up the entire system in Google Drive would likely be easier — but since I already use iCloud as a backup solution, this slots into my day-to-day workflow much more easily.</p>    <p>The setup process is a bit of a pain. It's not too complicated, but there are more steps than there need to be for something like this. Don't worry, though; all you iOS users in the same boat as me will find an easy solution to a problem that really should have already been solved with an Obsidian plugin. Seriously: why isn't there better Rocketbook integration already?</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>The root of this entire problem lies in iCloud. It creates a dedicated subfolder named after any third-party app, which makes access tricky. As a result of this, rather than syncing Rocketbook uploads directly into my Obsidian folder, I have to use an automation to move uploads.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><h2>
How to automatically transfer Rocketbook files into Obsidian
</h2><p>Due to iCloud's eccentricities with third-party applications, there are two main folders that come into play here. The first is the Rocketbook folder, created by the Rocketbook app itself. The second is my Obsidian folder, which contains multiple subfolders — one for each of my vaults. In this particular circumstance, I need the files from the Rocketbook folder to move into the correct Obsidian vault subfolder. Sounds complicated, right? It could be worse. I'd rate this setup as medium difficulty, so let's get started.</p>    <h3>
Set up the correct Rocketbook destination
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Open <strong>Rocketbook</strong> on your <strong>iOS</strong> device.
</li>
<li>
Tap <strong>Destinations</strong> in the bottom-right corner.
</li>
<li>
By default, the destination will be <strong>Email</strong>. Tap <strong>Change Destination</strong> -<strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>iCloud</strong> -<strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Create New Folder</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Name the folder.
</li>
<li>
Tap <strong>Save</strong> in the upper-right corner.
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<div><div><div data-img-unique-id="1-342447096" data-img-class="gallery-1-images-1751554233" data-gallery-modal-id="gallery-modal-1-880742842" data-gallery-slides-container-id="gallery-modal-1-slides-container-693835750"><div><div><img alt="A screenshot of someone setting a destination in the Rocketbook app." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/img_7308.PNG?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;dpr=2"></div></div></div><div data-img-unique-id="1-476224677" data-img-class="gallery-1-images-1751554233" data-gallery-modal-id="gallery-modal-1-880742842" data-gallery-slides-container-id="gallery-modal-1-slides-container-693835750"><div><div><img alt="A screenshot of the various Destinations available in the Rocketbook app. " src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/img_7309.PNG?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;dpr=2"></div></div></div><div data-img-unique-id="1-1665206384" data-img-class="gallery-1-images-1751554233" data-gallery-modal-id="gallery-modal-1-880742842" data-gallery-slides-container-id="gallery-modal-1-slides-container-693835750"><div><div><img alt="A screenshot of Rocketbook with iCloud set as the destination. " src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/img_7310.PNG?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;dpr=2"></div></div></div></div></div><div><button><span>Close</span></button><div><div><div data-stnl="%7B%22category%22%3A%22Click%20Interactions%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22Image%20Group%22%2C%22action%22%3A%22Next%20Image%20Click%22%7D"></div></div></div></div>
</div>
<p>Once you've set up your iCloud folder as the destination, you can quickly select it anytime you scan in a new note, and it will send the file straight there. Now, we can move on to creating the automation.</p>    <h3>
Set up the file automation
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Open <strong>Shortcuts</strong> on your iOS device.
</li>
<li>
Tap the <strong>Automation</strong> button in the bottom-center of the screen.
</li>
<li>
Tap <strong>New Automation.</strong>
</li>
<li>
This opens a menu that allows you to select the trigger that runs in the automation. Scroll down and select <strong>App.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Tap<strong> App -&gt; Rocketbook -&gt; Done.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Disable the toggle for <strong>Is Open</strong> and tap <strong>Is Closed</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Tap <strong>Run Immediately -&gt;</strong> <strong>Next.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Tap New Blank Automation.
</li>
<li>
Search for <strong>Get Contents of Folder</strong> and tap the light-blue <strong>Folder</strong> text beneath it, then select the <strong>Rocketbook folder</strong> you named earlier.
</li>
<li>
Search your actions again for <strong>Move </strong><strong>File</strong>. It will automatically populate the initial field with <strong>Get Contents of Folder</strong>, but you will need to tap <strong>Shortcuts</strong>, the default selection, and instead choose the folder for your Obsidian vault. In my case, I have a dedicated folder for Rocketbook uploads, but you can choose to send the files to your primary vault instead.
</li>
<li>
Tap <strong>Done.</strong>
</li>
</ol>
