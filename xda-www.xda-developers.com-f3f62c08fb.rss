<p>Here's the problem most knowledge workers hit: databases demand upfront decisions. In Notion, before you can jot down a client meeting note, you're creating properties, choosing select options, and building views. That friction means ideas die in your head before they reach the screen. I've abandoned countless Notion databases because the setup cost exceeded my motivation to maintain them.</p>    <p>Obsidian swings the opposite direction. You get pure markdown freedom, but connecting information requires manual linking and zero enforcement. I've watched <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/wish-knew-first-obsidian-vault-setup/" target="_blank">my Obsidian vaults</a> devolve into link graveyards where related notes sit isolated because I forgot to add the right tags or create the proper MOC (Map of Content).</p>    <p>Tana bridges this gap by allowing any bullet point to be transformed into structured data via supertags. You write first in a freeform outliner, then layer on metadata <span><em>only </em>when</span> it matters. The app treats organization as an enhancement, not a prerequisite.</p>    <h2>

<p>I’ve managed multiple consulting clients simultaneously, each with their own projects, deliverables, and timelines. In Notion, I'd built elaborate linked databases: a Clients table connecting to Projects, which in turn linked to Tasks, with rollups calculating bandwidth. It worked, but adding a quick client note meant navigating three database layers.</p>    <p>In Tana, I created a <strong>#client</strong> supertag with fields for industry, retainer amount, and project status. During client calls, I naturally type bullets. When I tag a node with <strong>#client</strong>, those fields appear — but they don't interrupt my flow if I ignore them. I can add the retainer amount later, or never, and the system doesn't break.</p>    <p>The magic happened when I tagged project bullets underneath client nodes with <strong>#project</strong>. Tana automatically surfaces all projects tagged to a specific client without me having to build views or relationships. I get Notion's relational power through spatial hierarchy instead of explicit linking. When I'm in my "Active Projects" view — a simple search for <strong>#project</strong> where status equals "In Progress" — Tana shows me which client each project belongs to because it inherits that context.</p>    <p>This feels like the future because it mirrors how we actually think. We don't mentally separate "this is client data" from "this is a thought about that client." Tana's supertags let information exist as both simultaneously.</p>    <h2>

<p> When I started planning a client website redesign, I didn’t map out timelines, phases, or trackers in advance. I just created a single node called “Website Redesign – XYZ Client Name” and began outlining what came to mind, be it discovery goals, design ideas, feedback notes, or deadlines.</p>    <p>Later, I tagged parts of that outline: the main node as <strong>#project</strong>, each phase as <strong>#phase</strong>, and a few bullets as <strong>#task</strong>. Suddenly, everything became searchable and grouped without me ever having to build a “system.”</p>    <p>That’s the magic: Tana lets structure grow with your work. I could add new fields to any supertag — say, “priority” for tasks or “budget” for projects, and it would instantly apply everywhere. I didn’t have to rebuild or duplicate <em>anything</em>.</p>    <p>It feels like project management that evolves as you think, not something you have to plan <em>before </em>you start thinking.</p>    <h2>

<p>I've tried dedicated spaced-repetition apps like Anki, but they require you to pre-commit to memorizing something. By the time I've decided a concept matters enough to create flashcards, I've already forgotten half of it.</p>    <p>In Tana, I created a <strong>#learn</strong> supertag with fields for topic, confidence level, and next review date. While reading documentation or taking notes, I tag key concepts with #learn inline. The information stays in its original context, tied to the project or article where I encountered it, but it's now also pulled into my spaced repetition system.</p>    <p>I built a simple search: show me all <strong>#learn</strong> nodes where the next review is today or earlier. Every morning, I review those items, update their confidence level, and Tana automatically adjusts the review date using a field calculation. It's spaced repetition that happens inside your actual work context, not in a separate flashcard silo.</p>    <p>This worked because Tana didn't make me choose between capturing knowledge and systematizing it. The same bullet that documents a technical concept in my project notes also functions as a reviewable learning item. No exporting, no syncing, no duplicate entry.</p>    <h2>

<p> Tana proved something crucial: the next generation of productivity tools will blend the flexibility of an outliner with the structure of a database. Users shouldn't have to choose between capturing thoughts naturally and organizing them systematically. Tana takes it further by making metadata native to the outliner itself, rather than bolted on via frontmatter or properties panels. The progression is clear. Tools are moving toward letting structure emerge from content rather than requiring it up front.</p>    <p>While traditional database apps like Airtable and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tana-as-notion-replacement/" target="_blank">Notion might be a better fit for some</a> and won't disappear, they'll need to adopt this "write first, structure later" philosophy. The friction of pre-defining schemas is too high for how most knowledge work actually happens. We think in streams, not tables.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, pure Markdown tools like Obsidian face pressure to add first-class support for structured data. Tags and YAML frontmatter are approximations of what supertags accomplish natively. The apps that win will be those that make metadata as fluid as text itself.</p>    <p>Tana's supertag system goes beyond being "just a clever feature." It's a proof of concept that productivity software can be both flexible and structured, both spontaneous and systematic. That combination is the only way forward.</p>]]>

I just created a single node called “Website Redesign – XYZ Client Name” and began outlining what came to mind, be it discovery goals, design ideas, feedback notes, or deadlines.</p>    <p>Later, I tagged parts of that outline: the main node as <strong>#project</strong>, each phase as <strong>#phase</strong>, and a few bullets as <strong>#task</strong>. Suddenly, everything became searchable and grouped without me ever having to build a “system.”</p>    <p>That’s the magic: Tana lets structure grow with your work. I could add new fields to any supertag — say, “priority” for tasks or “budget” for projects, and it would instantly apply everywhere. I didn’t have to rebuild or duplicate <em>anything</em>.</p>    <p>It feels like project management that evolves as you think, not something you have to plan <em>before </em>you start thinking.</p>    <h2>
Using supertags for spaced repetition learning
</h2><h3>
Knowledge management became effortless
</h3>

<img alt="Screenshot of Tana for repetition based learning" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/tana-for-learning.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">

</div>
<p>I've tried dedicated spaced-repetition apps like Anki, but they require you to pre-commit to memorizing something. By the time I've decided a concept matters enough to create flashcards, I've already forgotten half of it.</p>    <p>In Tana, I created a <strong>#learn</strong> supertag with fields for topic, confidence level, and next review date. While reading documentation or taking notes, I tag key concepts with #learn inline. The information stays in its original context, tied to the project or article where I encountered it, but it's now also pulled into my spaced repetition system.</p>    <p>I built a simple search: show me all <strong>#learn</strong> nodes where the next review is today or earlier. Every morning, I review those items, update their confidence level, and Tana automatically adjusts the review date using a field calculation. It's spaced repetition that happens inside your actual work context, not in a separate flashcard silo.</p>    <p>This worked because Tana didn't make me choose between capturing knowledge and systematizing it. The same bullet that documents a technical concept in my project notes also functions as a reviewable learning item. No exporting, no syncing, no duplicate entry.</p>    <h2>
Why this signals a shift in productivity software
</h2><h3>
The outliner-database hybrid is inevitable
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of powerful Tana templates " src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/tana-templates.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Tana proved something crucial: the next generation of productivity tools will blend the flexibility of an outliner with the structure of a database. Users shouldn't have to choose between capturing thoughts naturally and organizing them systematically. Tana takes it further by making metadata native to the outliner itself, rather than bolted on via frontmatter or properties panels. The progression is clear. Tools are moving toward letting structure emerge from content rather than requiring it up front.</p>    <p>While traditional database apps like Airtable and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tana-as-notion-replacement/" target="_blank">Notion might be a better fit for some</a> and won't disappear, they'll need to adopt this "write first, structure later" philosophy. The friction of pre-defining schemas is too high for how most knowledge work actually happens. We think in streams, not tables.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, pure Markdown tools like Obsidian face pressure to add first-class support for structured data. Tags and YAML frontmatter are approximations of what supertags accomplish natively. The apps that win will be those that make metadata as fluid as text itself.</p>    <p>Tana's supertag system goes beyond being "just a clever feature." It's a proof of concept that productivity software can be both flexible and structured, both spontaneous and systematic. That combination is the only way forward.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Many people I know, even outside the audiophile circles, still prefer wired audio for an assortment of reasons ranging from lower latency to eliminating the risk of batteries dying mid-call.

Meanwhile, makers of expensive <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/choose-best-dock-your-laptop/" target="_blank">USB-C docks</a> are completely ignoring this demographic, tossing a basic headphone jack onto a crowded PCB without isolation, and calling it a day. That's a disservice to the consumer in my book.</p>    <p>The core of the problem is electrical noise. A USB-C dock is an incredibly busy electrical environment. You have high-speed data lanes for USB 3.2, video signals for multiple 4K displays, and power delivery circuits pushing up to 100 watts. All of this activity generates electromagnetic interference (EMI), which is poison to sensitive analog audio signals.

It's the same reason high-end motherboard manufacturers <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/5-reasons-you-might-need-sound-card/" target="_blank">make a huge deal about their audio</a> solutions, often physically separating the audio PCB traces from the rest of the board and using dedicated power regulation and high-quality capacitors.

<p> To the average consumer, checking for good components for a barely perceptible difference in audio quality isn't justifiable. That's precisely why many of us just end up using Bluetooth earbuds in a pinch. I also use a few TWS buds myself when I'm on the go, but Bluetooth is a significant step-down for pure audio fidelity. No matter what fancy marketing terms get thrown around, Bluetooth audio is still ‌based on lossy compression. Audio is squeezed, transmitted wirelessly, and then converted to analog. The transmission inevitably loses information.</p>    <p>Codecs like SBC, AAC, and the various flavors of Qualcomm AptX all have their limitations. Even Sony's much-lauded LDAC, which boasts a higher bitrate, is still not truly lossless, and its performance can vary wildly depending on signal strength and device implementation. This creates a confusing and proprietary ecosystem where I have to match your source device with my headphones to get the best but still-compromised experience. On the flip side, a simple wired connection <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-wired-earphones-headphones-dac-lossless-audio/" target="_blank">delivers bit-perfect reproduction</a> of the audio stream from the source to my headphone drivers.

An integrated, purpose-built audio output with quality components and isolated circuitry would eliminate this entire category of problems. It would just work reliably every single time like every other port on that hub or dock.</p>    <h3>
It's time for docks to take audio seriously

<p> If desktop <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-make-on-board-motherboard-audio-better/" target="_blank">motherboard makers haven't given up</a> on high-quality onboard audio, why have dock manufacturers decided that laptop users don't care? Dedicated headphone amps as key features on gaming and creator-focused motherboards, and the assumption that someone sheds this requirement in switching from a tower PC to a laptop is illogical. It is time that brands step up their game, at least for their flagship products.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>For two decades, search has meant the same thing: type a query, scan a list of blue links, open five tabs, and synthesize the answer yourself. Google refined the algorithm, but the format stayed frozen in 1998. Then Perplexity arrived amongst the wave of AI tools with a different proposition: what if search engines actually answered questions instead of just pointing you toward answers?</p>    <p>I spend a lot of time researching <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-apps-i-paired-with-notebooklm/" target="_blank">productivity tools and how to use them with AI</a> but it’s undeniable Google has been muscle memory for years. But after hearing a few friends rave about Perplexity's conversational search, I committed to using it as my default engine in an experiment.</p>    <p>The question I sought an answer to: whether Perplexity can deliver for real-world needs: work research, travel planning, tech troubleshooting, and the random curiosity spirals we all fall into. What I found? It fundamentally changed how I search, though not without exposing some significant cracks.</p>    <h2>
What Perplexity gets right about modern search
</h2><h3>
It treats context like a conversation

</div>
</div>
<p>The most immediate shift was how Perplexity handles follow-up questions. When I searched "best project management tools for remote teams," it gave me a synthesized answer with clear citations. But here's where it diverged from traditional search: I could immediately ask "which ones integrate with Notion?" without re-explaining the entire context. Perplexity remembered we were discussing project management software and filtered its previous answer accordingly.</p>    <p>Google would have treated that follow-up as a completely new search, likely surfacing generic Notion integration articles. Microsoft Copilot does better here — it maintains conversational context within Edge — but it's embedded in Microsoft's ecosystem, making it feel more like a sidebar feature than a search replacement.</p>    <p>Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE) attempts similar context awareness, but it's still layered on top of traditional results, creating a hybrid experience that feels indecisive about its own purpose. Plus, with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-why-perplexity-comet-has-become-primary-browser/" target="_blank">Perplexity launching its Comet browser</a>, its adaptability for search will only grow multifold.</p>    <h2>

</div>
</div>
<p>The mental load reduction was tangible. For a piece on VPN services, I asked Perplexity to "compare NordVPN and Mullvad for privacy-focused users." It returned a structured breakdown: NordVPN's audited no-logs policy and server network size, Mullvad's anonymous account system and open-source commitment, and specific scenarios where each excels. Every claim was cited, usually a mix of privacy audit reports, Reddit discussions, and technical reviews.</p>    <p>I could have found this information through Google, but it would have required skimming four different reviews, cross-referencing features, and building my own mental model. Perplexity did the synthesis work upfront, and because it showed sources clearly, I could verify claims without starting from scratch. This helps offload the aggregation step while maintaining transparency.</p>    <p>For travel research, I tested "three-day itinerary for Kyoto in spring," thet type of query where Google usually surfaces SEO-optimized listicles stuffed with ads. Perplexity compiled suggestions from travel blogs, Reddit's Japan Travel community, and official tourism sites, organizing them into logical day-by-day plans. When I asked "which of these are accessible by subway," it filtered options immediately. The time saved wasn't just speed but also all the decision fatigue from comparing 15 browser tabs.</p>    <h2>
Where Perplexity hits the wall

AI has blindspots it won't admit

<img alt="Screenshot example of where Perplexity sources are limited by the paywall" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/perplexity-paywall.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>The problems emerged with niche queries. For example, when researching a question like “Does Shopify automatically collect sales tax for international digital product sales?” Perplexity confidently presented an answer but it was oversimplified. The sources it cited explained general sales tax collection rules for U.S. merchants, not the specific nuances of VAT, GST, or region-based digital tax obligations that vary by country. Google, with its sprawling index, surfaced an obscure Shopify community thread and a European Commission PDF clarifying how cross-border digital sales are treated under EU VAT rules.</p>    <p>This exposes Perplexity’s core limitation: it optimizes for confidence over comprehensiveness. When a query falls outside well-documented territory, it just synthesizes from whatever sources it can access, even if they’re tangential. Google’s blue links might feel antiquated, but at least they let you judge source relevance yourself. Perplexity makes that call for you, which works beautifully for mainstream topics but falters when you need depth.</p>    <p>Paywall gating created friction too. Multiple searches returned summaries based on paywalled articles I couldn't verify without subscriptions. Perplexity would cite a New York Times piece or academic paper, but actually reading the source required paying up. Google doesn't solve this either, but it doesn't pretend to. You know upfront when something's gated. With Perplexity, the synthesis made it feel like the information was accessible when it often wasn't.</p>    <h2>
When traditional search still wins

The index matters more than the interface

</div>
</div>
<p>For highly specific software documentation, Google's exhaustive index is irreplaceable. Searching for "Claude API parameter streaming tokens" on Perplexity gave me a decent overview, but Google surfaced the exact documentation page in its first result. No synthesis needed, just the answer.</p>    <p>Shopping comparisons revealed another gap. Perplexity synthesizes reviews well enough, but it doesn't integrate shopping features like price tracking, inventory checks, or direct purchase links the way Google Shopping does. When I searched "best standing desk under $500," Perplexity gave thoughtful recommendations, but I still had to jump to Amazon or retailers to check availability. Google's ecosystem integration (Maps, Shopping, Gmail) creates connective tissue Perplexity can't replicate yet.</p>    <p>Google SGE occupies an awkward middle ground here. It adds AI-generated summaries above traditional results, but the summaries often feel redundant when blue links sit right below them. Microsoft Copilot integrates more naturally within Edge, but it's locked to that browser and Microsoft's broader services. Perplexity's strength is its independence — it's not trying to funnel you into an ecosystem, just answer your question.</p>    <h2>
The verdict: search finally has competition

It's not perfect, but it's legitimately different

<p>After a week, I haven't switched back. Perplexity reduced my search time significantly for knowledge-based queries, and the conversational follow-ups made research feel less like tab juggling and more like thinking out loud with a knowledgeable partner. The transparency around sources builds trust in a way vague AI summaries don't. You can also <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ways-i-use-perplexity-that-have-nothing-to-do-with-research/" target="_blank">use Perplexity beyond research purposes</a>.</p>    <p>But it's not a universal replacement for search. For niche topics, shopping, and ecosystem-dependent tasks, Google's index and integrations still dominate. Perplexity works best as a complementary tool. It's become my default for exploratory research, explanations, and context-heavy queries, while Google remains the fallback for precision and breadth.</p>    <p>Search isn't going back to 1998. Perplexity proves the answer-first model works when done thoughtfully, and it's pushed Google and Microsoft to respond.

<p>Setting up KDE Connect was relatively straightforward and didn't require creating an account. I opened KDE Connect on my PC and then downloaded the app to my Android phone. I paired them up via a method that seems to use your network Wi-Fi to match them up.</p>    <p>Once it was paired up, I could use the app on my phone to refine which apps sent notifications and the general behavior of KDE Connect. I noticed it didn't have <em>all</em> the features of Phone Link; for instance, there was no phone screen mirroring, and I couldn't make calls with KDE Connect, although I could set it up so it would make a phone call sound on my PC when someone called me on my phone.</p>    <p>Otherwise, it did the trick.

<p>KDE Connect did what I wanted, but I began to get <em>really</em> impressed when I began prodding around the app. I discovered a feature that turns your phone's screen into a digital trackpad, so you can move your mouse around remotely. Given how I like to chill on my sofa and watch stuff on my monitor away from my keyboard and mouse, I loved how I could take control of my cursor using the KDE Connect to click on things.</p>    <p>Then, KDE Connect proved that it could do something that my old app, PushBullet, could also do: send and receive stuff via my browser. All I had to do was install the Plasma Integration extension on Chrome; once done, I could right-click pages, links, and even images, then hover over "Plasma Integration" in the right-click menu and select the device I wanted to send it to.</p>    <p>And the best bit? While Windows Phone Link only works on Windows, <a href="https://kdeconnect.kde.org/download.html" target="_blank">KDE Connect can work on pretty much every commonly used operating system</a>, <em>including Windows</em>.

<p>That being said, I still haven't used every single feature in KDE Connect. I've only used it for about a month now, and it's doing everything I want it to; however, it's good to know that, if a new use case crops up in the future, KDE Connect can cover it.</p>    <p>For instance, you can <a href="https://userbase.kde.org/KDE_Connect/Tutorials/Useful_commands" target="_blank">set up commands on your PC that you can trigger on your phone via KDE Connect</a>. You have to set up the commands on the desktop app, presumably to prevent someone from stealing your phone and using it to create and activate stealth commands, but the payoff is well worth it. I used one of the example commands on the wiki linked above to create a script that, when activated from my phone, took a photo from my webcam, saved it to my PC, and then sent the image to my phone. If you use KDE Connect on Windows, you can use it to run PowerShell commands.</p>    <p><span>Additionally, I've heard that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/197p2hy/please_learn_to_use_kde_connect/" target="_blank">some people prefer to install</a></span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/197p2hy/please_learn_to_use_kde_connect/" target="_blank"> KDE Connect on their Steam Deck</a>. That way, you can share images and files between your Deck and your PC with ease. I haven't given this feature a try, but it goes to show how you can go beyond a PC and a phone with KDE Connect.</p>    <h3>
Linux does a lot right for me

<p>The more I use Linux, the more I see it as less of a Windows alternative and more of a replacement. KDE Connect has really blown me away, and I can't wait to see what else Linux has in store.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>The EVO fighting game championships are the biggest event for the fighting game genre. It gathers some of the greatest players from around the world for a few days to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/the-5-most-influential-fighting-games-of-all-time" target="_blank">celebrate fighting games</a>, as well as compete for world titles and big prizes. But within the history of the prestigious fighting game tournament, there are specific games that have become synonymous with the event. They attracted the biggest audiences and injected unparalleled levels of hype for spectators watching the competition unfold. Some of the craziest moments and memorable times are tied to the ongoing legacy of fighting game releases that have become popular over the years.</p>    <p>For many fighting game fans, these types of fighting games are indisputable staples for an event like EVO. Whenever discussions about the event come up, certain games are always referenced and remembered fondly. And as long as EVO continues to be a mecca for fighting game fans around the world, these games will continue to be tied to it. Here are four of the biggest fighting games to ever be part of the EVO championship series.</p>    <h2>
Super Smash Bros. Melee
</h2><h3>
A new kind of fighter enters
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-517944734" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-517944734" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-517944734" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-517944734" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-517944734-img" data-gallery-type="">

</div>
<p>When <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ranking-every-super-smash-bros-game-released-by-nintendo" target="_blank"><em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em></a> first came out, it was viewed as a fun party game that Nintendo fans could enjoy together. But over time, the perception of the game drastically changed among the competitive crowd. Various techniques and play styles that were discovered to be part of the game helped create a very dedicated base of players that took <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> to another level. Things eventually got so big that the game eventually became part of the lineup of titles included for the EVO championship series. And the competition drew in a lot of players, but even more fans were looking to watch.</p>    <p>What's interesting about <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> was how it was a very different kind of fighting game to become part of the group of titles to see at EVO. Before then, the competition was dominated by the presence of more traditional fighting games like <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, and <em>Tekken</em>, which were staples of the genre and the competitive scene for a very long time. But <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> offered something unique and flashy for everyone to watch, especially since <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gamecube-games-need-switch-online" target="_blank">Nintendo characters like Mario</a> and Pikachu were duking it out on screens. But the high level of play from competitors was also remarkable to follow, with strategies that took advantage of the game's physics to allow characters to move faster, and hit harder when it mattered the most. </p>

</div>
</div>
<p>At first, some traditional fighting game fans resisted <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> being seen in the same light as other fighting games, but eventually more people grew to accept it. And since then, whenever <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> is included in the lineup of games for the competition, and there's always a giant crowd for it. Its reception eventually led to other <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/next-super-smash-bros-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank">games being included in future</a> EVO series, with one of the biggest being <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> for the Nintendo Switch. </p>

<p>There are very few things that are as hype-inducing as an episode of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-according-to-ratings-post" target="_blank"><em>Dragon Ball Z</em></a>. And many people within the greater fighting game community grew up watching the show while playing many of the classic fighting games we have today. But what happened when the two types of fandom were combined into one? We got <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> from Arc System Works. And anime fans around the world rejoiced. It became one of the best anime-based games around, as well as one of the biggest fighting games ever released. </p>    <p>But things got even more interesting when the game began to show up at competitions and, eventually, the EVO championships. The support for the game was astounding, with hundreds and thousands of people watching the finals of EVO events whenever the game was featured. Some of the crowd reactions to <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> became part of the event, with fans screaming and shouting alongside certain characters that would be chosen for a match. It was a blend of two <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/3-fighting-game-spinoffs-that-were-excellent-and-packed-a-heavy-punch" target="_blank">different types of fan groups</a> that complimented one another for a long time, and finally there was something that they had in common. To this day, <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> is still heavily supported by players and fighting game events, including EVO, with large prize pools and exhibitions. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/capcom-updated-marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics" target="_blank"><em>Street Fighter</em> series from Capcom</a> has a very long and very relevant history to the EVO champsionships. The series was one of the major cornerstone inclusions for players to compete in, with games like <em>Super </em><em>Street Fighter II Turbo, and</em> it's previous iterations, being a big reason why the event grew very popular. But one event is synonymous with EVO and has become a thing of legend among the fighting game community, which is still referenced today in many places. The moment comes from <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> in a bout between two legendary fighting game players, and was dubbed EVO Moment 37. In a clutch instant during the match, fighting champion Diago parries every hit of a super attack combo launched by former champion Justin Wong, hitting every parry and counterattacking with his own super attack to win the match.</p>    <p>This moment was not only shocking in person, but was shared online many times over and gave others a look at the craziness and hype that an event like EVO contained. But even before that legendary moment, <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> was still a major part of the competition, and only larger in relevance and importance in the years following EVO Moment 37. Many <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/review-capcom-fighting-collection-2" target="_blank">die-hard fighting game</a> players view the game as one of the high points of the series, with many gameplay elements and strategies that push the level of competition to an incredibly high benchmark.</p>

<p>For many years, <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> was a game that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/greatest-female-fighting-game-characters" target="_blank">was integral to the spectacle</a> that was EVO, with tons of fighting game players looking to participate, with hopes of seeing their own moment. In later years, other fighting games from Capcom would include many characteristics and gameplay mechanics that were similar to what people loved about <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em>. </p>

<p>While games like <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> had legendary moments and attracted many people to events like EVO, it wasn't the craziest game to garner the most reactions from people. The <em>Street Fighter</em> series may have laid the foundation for the event, but it was the <em>Marvel Vs Capcom</em> series that solidified it for most people. The reason is because of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-marvel-comics-games-that-are-avengers-level-classics" target="_blank">games like <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</em></a>, which was incredibly chaotic to watch and very deep and challenging to play at a high level. Anyone that has ever attended EVO in any year will tell you that people lose their minds whenever <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> is being shown on stage or during live streams. The game is just that popular among fighting game fans, especially those who grew up playing arcade fighting games in the 90s.</p>    <p>The real appeal of <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> as a game is seeing <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/big-superhero-games-arent-going-away" target="_blank">iconic heroes from Marvel Comics</a> team up and clash with Capcom characters from various games. But through the eyes of fighting game comeptitors and champions, <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> is the pinnacle of aggressive competition. The game has many strategies and techniques that players have discovered and enhanced over the years, which have led others to come up with tons of character combinations and play styles that were competitively viable. And just when you think the ceiling has been reached with it, more people are able to find new ways to tackle match-ups and change the landscape of what <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> is capable of showing. </p>

<p>Whenever the game is shown at EVO events, there's always a big crowd who tune in to watch. The spectacle of seeing characters fly across the screen, with beams and projectiles being flung in all directions, and other jumping into the mix is chaotic. There can be so many "blink, and you miss it" moments during a match in <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em>, which can make all the difference between someone losing a set or becoming a new EVO champion. While the majority of high-level matches usually involve the same combination of characters or pairings, the matches themselves are almost never the same all around. For years, people have considered <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> to be one of the best games to watch in the finals, as well as one of the biggest titles that players could compete in during EVO. And since then, the hype for <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> has never died, because you can always a few people going around to ask people "When's Marvel?" during the event.</p>

As EVO continues to be hosted each year and attracts more fighting game competitors looking for glory, newer titles will continue to be added to its lineup for everyone to spectate.

      <![CDATA[<p>The EVO fighting game championships are the biggest event for the fighting game genre. It gathers some of the greatest players from around the world for a few days to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/the-5-most-influential-fighting-games-of-all-time" target="_blank">celebrate fighting games</a>, as well as compete for world titles and big prizes. But within the history of the prestigious fighting game tournament, there are specific games that have become synonymous with the event. They attracted the biggest audiences and injected unparalleled levels of hype for spectators watching the competition unfold. Some of the craziest moments and memorable times are tied to the ongoing legacy of fighting game releases that have become popular over the years.</p>    <p>For many fighting game fans, these types of fighting games are indisputable staples for an event like EVO. Whenever discussions about the event come up, certain games are always referenced and remembered fondly. And as long as EVO continues to be a mecca for fighting game fans around the world, these games will continue to be tied to it. Here are four of the biggest fighting games to ever be part of the EVO championship series.</p>    <h2>
Super Smash Bros. Melee
</h2><h3>
A new kind of fighter enters

<p>When <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ranking-every-super-smash-bros-game-released-by-nintendo" target="_blank"><em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em></a> first came out, it was viewed as a fun party game that Nintendo fans could enjoy together. But over time, the perception of the game drastically changed among the competitive crowd. Various techniques and play styles that were discovered to be part of the game helped create a very dedicated base of players that took <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> to another level. Things eventually got so big that the game eventually became part of the lineup of titles included for the EVO championship series. And the competition drew in a lot of players, but even more fans were looking to watch.</p>    <p>What's interesting about <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> was how it was a very different kind of fighting game to become part of the group of titles to see at EVO. Before then, the competition was dominated by the presence of more traditional fighting games like <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, and <em>Tekken</em>, which were staples of the genre and the competitive scene for a very long time. But <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> offered something unique and flashy for everyone to watch, especially since <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gamecube-games-need-switch-online" target="_blank">Nintendo characters like Mario</a> and Pikachu were duking it out on screens. But the high level of play from competitors was also remarkable to follow, with strategies that took advantage of the game's physics to allow characters to move faster, and hit harder when it mattered the most. </p>

<p>At first, some traditional fighting game fans resisted <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> being seen in the same light as other fighting games, but eventually more people grew to accept it. And since then, whenever <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> is included in the lineup of games for the competition, and there's always a giant crowd for it. Its reception eventually led to other <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/next-super-smash-bros-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank">games being included in future</a> EVO series, with one of the biggest being <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> for the Nintendo Switch. </p>

<p>There are very few things that are as hype-inducing as an episode of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-according-to-ratings-post" target="_blank"><em>Dragon Ball Z</em></a>. And many people within the greater fighting game community grew up watching the show while playing many of the classic fighting games we have today. But what happened when the two types of fandom were combined into one? We got <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> from Arc System Works. And anime fans around the world rejoiced. It became one of the best anime-based games around, as well as one of the biggest fighting games ever released. </p>    <p>But things got even more interesting when the game began to show up at competitions and, eventually, the EVO championships. The support for the game was astounding, with hundreds and thousands of people watching the finals of EVO events whenever the game was featured. Some of the crowd reactions to <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> became part of the event, with fans screaming and shouting alongside certain characters that would be chosen for a match. It was a blend of two <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/3-fighting-game-spinoffs-that-were-excellent-and-packed-a-heavy-punch" target="_blank">different types of fan groups</a> that complimented one another for a long time, and finally there was something that they had in common. To this day, <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> is still heavily supported by players and fighting game events, including EVO, with large prize pools and exhibitions. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/capcom-updated-marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics" target="_blank"><em>Street Fighter</em> series from Capcom</a> has a very long and very relevant history to the EVO champsionships. The series was one of the major cornerstone inclusions for players to compete in, with games like <em>Super </em><em>Street Fighter II Turbo, and</em> it's previous iterations, being a big reason why the event grew very popular. But one event is synonymous with EVO and has become a thing of legend among the fighting game community, which is still referenced today in many places. The moment comes from <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> in a bout between two legendary fighting game players, and was dubbed EVO Moment 37. In a clutch instant during the match, fighting champion Diago parries every hit of a super attack combo launched by former champion Justin Wong, hitting every parry and counterattacking with his own super attack to win the match.</p>    <p>This moment was not only shocking in person, but was shared online many times over and gave others a look at the craziness and hype that an event like EVO contained. But even before that legendary moment, <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> was still a major part of the competition, and only larger in relevance and importance in the years following EVO Moment 37. Many <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/review-capcom-fighting-collection-2" target="_blank">die-hard fighting game</a> players view the game as one of the high points of the series, with many gameplay elements and strategies that push the level of competition to an incredibly high benchmark.</p>

<p>For many years, <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> was a game that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/greatest-female-fighting-game-characters" target="_blank">was integral to the spectacle</a> that was EVO, with tons of fighting game players looking to participate, with hopes of seeing their own moment. In later years, other fighting games from Capcom would include many characteristics and gameplay mechanics that were similar to what people loved about <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em>. </p>

<p>While games like <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> had legendary moments and attracted many people to events like EVO, it wasn't the craziest game to garner the most reactions from people. The <em>Street Fighter</em> series may have laid the foundation for the event, but it was the <em>Marvel Vs Capcom</em> series that solidified it for most people. The reason is because of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-marvel-comics-games-that-are-avengers-level-classics" target="_blank">games like <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</em></a>, which was incredibly chaotic to watch and very deep and challenging to play at a high level. Anyone that has ever attended EVO in any year will tell you that people lose their minds whenever <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> is being shown on stage or during live streams. The game is just that popular among fighting game fans, especially those who grew up playing arcade fighting games in the 90s.</p>    <p>The real appeal of <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> as a game is seeing <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/big-superhero-games-arent-going-away" target="_blank">iconic heroes from Marvel Comics</a> team up and clash with Capcom characters from various games. But through the eyes of fighting game comeptitors and champions, <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> is the pinnacle of aggressive competition. The game has many strategies and techniques that players have discovered and enhanced over the years, which have led others to come up with tons of character combinations and play styles that were competitively viable. And just when you think the ceiling has been reached with it, more people are able to find new ways to tackle match-ups and change the landscape of what <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> is capable of showing. </p>

<p>Whenever the game is shown at EVO events, there's always a big crowd who tune in to watch. The spectacle of seeing characters fly across the screen, with beams and projectiles being flung in all directions, and other jumping into the mix is chaotic. There can be so many "blink, and you miss it" moments during a match in <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em>, which can make all the difference between someone losing a set or becoming a new EVO champion. While the majority of high-level matches usually involve the same combination of characters or pairings, the matches themselves are almost never the same all around. For years, people have considered <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> to be one of the best games to watch in the finals, as well as one of the biggest titles that players could compete in during EVO. And since then, the hype for <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> has never died, because you can always a few people going around to ask people "When's Marvel?" during the event.</p>

<h3>
Legendary fighters for a legendary event
</h3>
<p>There is no bigger fighting game event that is more relevant to fighting game fans than EVO. It has a history with players that has resonated for years, giving a place for everyone to view high-level gameplay and crazy, unforgettable moments. The games that have been part of the competition's legacy were some of the biggest <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/franchises-overdue-capcom-fighting-collection-treatment" target="_blank">games that fighting game fans love</a> to revisit, whether competitively or just for fun. As EVO continues to be hosted each year and attracts more fighting game competitors looking for glory, newer titles will continue to be added to its lineup for everyone to spectate. But nobody will ever forget some of the best times that EVO had with many of the classics that helped make it what it is today.</p>]]>
    </description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The EVO fighting game championships are the biggest event for the fighting game genre. It gathers some of the greatest players from around the world for a few days to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/the-5-most-influential-fighting-games-of-all-time" target="_blank">celebrate fighting games</a>, as well as compete for world titles and big prizes. But within the history of the prestigious fighting game tournament, there are specific games that have become synonymous with the event. They attracted the biggest audiences and injected unparalleled levels of hype for spectators watching the competition unfold. Some of the craziest moments and memorable times are tied to the ongoing legacy of fighting game releases that have become popular over the years.</p>    <p>For many fighting game fans, these types of fighting games are indisputable staples for an event like EVO. Whenever discussions about the event come up, certain games are always referenced and remembered fondly. And as long as EVO continues to be a mecca for fighting game fans around the world, these games will continue to be tied to it. Here are four of the biggest fighting games to ever be part of the EVO championship series.</p>    <h2>
Super Smash Bros. Melee
</h2><h3>
A new kind of fighter enters
</h3>

<p>When <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ranking-every-super-smash-bros-game-released-by-nintendo" target="_blank"><em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em></a> first came out, it was viewed as a fun party game that Nintendo fans could enjoy together. But over time, the perception of the game drastically changed among the competitive crowd. Various techniques and play styles that were discovered to be part of the game helped create a very dedicated base of players that took <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> to another level. Things eventually got so big that the game eventually became part of the lineup of titles included for the EVO championship series. And the competition drew in a lot of players, but even more fans were looking to watch.</p>    <p>What's interesting about <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> was how it was a very different kind of fighting game to become part of the group of titles to see at EVO. Before then, the competition was dominated by the presence of more traditional fighting games like <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, and <em>Tekken</em>, which were staples of the genre and the competitive scene for a very long time. But <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> offered something unique and flashy for everyone to watch, especially since <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gamecube-games-need-switch-online" target="_blank">Nintendo characters like Mario</a> and Pikachu were duking it out on screens. But the high level of play from competitors was also remarkable to follow, with strategies that took advantage of the game's physics to allow characters to move faster, and hit harder when it mattered the most. </p>

<p>At first, some traditional fighting game fans resisted <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> being seen in the same light as other fighting games, but eventually more people grew to accept it. And since then, whenever <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> is included in the lineup of games for the competition, and there's always a giant crowd for it. Its reception eventually led to other <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/next-super-smash-bros-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank">games being included in future</a> EVO series, with one of the biggest being <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> for the Nintendo Switch. </p>

<p>There are very few things that are as hype-inducing as an episode of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-according-to-ratings-post" target="_blank"><em>Dragon Ball Z</em></a>. And many people within the greater fighting game community grew up watching the show while playing many of the classic fighting games we have today. But what happened when the two types of fandom were combined into one? We got <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> from Arc System Works. And anime fans around the world rejoiced. It became one of the best anime-based games around, as well as one of the biggest fighting games ever released. </p>    <p>But things got even more interesting when the game began to show up at competitions and, eventually, the EVO championships. The support for the game was astounding, with hundreds and thousands of people watching the finals of EVO events whenever the game was featured. Some of the crowd reactions to <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> became part of the event, with fans screaming and shouting alongside certain characters that would be chosen for a match. It was a blend of two <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/3-fighting-game-spinoffs-that-were-excellent-and-packed-a-heavy-punch" target="_blank">different types of fan groups</a> that complimented one another for a long time, and finally there was something that they had in common. To this day, <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> is still heavily supported by players and fighting game events, including EVO, with large prize pools and exhibitions. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/capcom-updated-marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics" target="_blank"><em>Street Fighter</em> series from Capcom</a> has a very long and very relevant history to the EVO champsionships. The series was one of the major cornerstone inclusions for players to compete in, with games like <em>Super </em><em>Street Fighter II Turbo, and</em> it's previous iterations, being a big reason why the event grew very popular. But one event is synonymous with EVO and has become a thing of legend among the fighting game community, which is still referenced today in many places. The moment comes from <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> in a bout between two legendary fighting game players, and was dubbed EVO Moment 37. In a clutch instant during the match, fighting champion Diago parries every hit of a super attack combo launched by former champion Justin Wong, hitting every parry and counterattacking with his own super attack to win the match.</p>    <p>This moment was not only shocking in person, but was shared online many times over and gave others a look at the craziness and hype that an event like EVO contained. But even before that legendary moment, <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> was still a major part of the competition, and only larger in relevance and importance in the years following EVO Moment 37. Many <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/review-capcom-fighting-collection-2" target="_blank">die-hard fighting game</a> players view the game as one of the high points of the series, with many gameplay elements and strategies that push the level of competition to an incredibly high benchmark.</p>

<p>For many years, <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> was a game that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/greatest-female-fighting-game-characters" target="_blank">was integral to the spectacle</a> that was EVO, with tons of fighting game players looking to participate, with hopes of seeing their own moment. In later years, other fighting games from Capcom would include many characteristics and gameplay mechanics that were similar to what people loved about <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em>. </p>

<p>While games like <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> had legendary moments and attracted many people to events like EVO, it wasn't the craziest game to garner the most reactions from people. The <em>Street Fighter</em> series may have laid the foundation for the event, but it was the <em>Marvel Vs Capcom</em> series that solidified it for most people. The reason is because of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-marvel-comics-games-that-are-avengers-level-classics" target="_blank">games like <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</em></a>, which was incredibly chaotic to watch and very deep and challenging to play at a high level. Anyone that has ever attended EVO in any year will tell you that people lose their minds whenever <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> is being shown on stage or during live streams. The game is just that popular among fighting game fans, especially those who grew up playing arcade fighting games in the 90s.</p>    <p>The real appeal of <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> as a game is seeing <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/big-superhero-games-arent-going-away" target="_blank">iconic heroes from Marvel Comics</a> team up and clash with Capcom characters from various games. But through the eyes of fighting game comeptitors and champions, <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> is the pinnacle of aggressive competition. The game has many strategies and techniques that players have discovered and enhanced over the years, which have led others to come up with tons of character combinations and play styles that were competitively viable. And just when you think the ceiling has been reached with it, more people are able to find new ways to tackle match-ups and change the landscape of what <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> is capable of showing. </p>

<p>Whenever the game is shown at EVO events, there's always a big crowd who tune in to watch. The spectacle of seeing characters fly across the screen, with beams and projectiles being flung in all directions, and other jumping into the mix is chaotic. There can be so many "blink, and you miss it" moments during a match in <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em>, which can make all the difference between someone losing a set or becoming a new EVO champion. While the majority of high-level matches usually involve the same combination of characters or pairings, the matches themselves are almost never the same all around. For years, people have considered <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> to be one of the best games to watch in the finals, as well as one of the biggest titles that players could compete in during EVO. And since then, the hype for <em>Marvel Vs Capcom 2</em> has never died, because you can always a few people going around to ask people "When's Marvel?" during the event.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) SSDs are among the fastest storage solutions available today. These drives have completely changed the way modern systems handle storage. Whether you're booting your OS, playing games, launching high-end applications, or working with large files, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/5-things-to-consider-before-buying-an-nvme-ssd/" target="_blank">NVMe SSDs</a> offer lightning-fast response times that easily outperform traditional SATA SSDs and, of course, HDDs. However fast they are, NVMe drives still need some basic care to stay that way.</p>    <p>Since SSDs lack mechanical moving parts, unlike HDDs, many users think that they are maintenance-free. While it's true that SSDs are more resilient than spinning drives, following a few basic practices can help protect them from early wear and tear, data loss, or degraded performance over time.</p>    <p>I have been using NVMe SSDs for a long time, and the following are the simple tricks that help me keep them healthy and get the most out of them.</p>    <h2>
Keeping TRIM enabled
</h2><h3>
Letting Windows clean up automatically
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Checking if TRIM is enabled on an NVMe SSD" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/checking-if-trim-is-enabled-on-an-nvme-ssd.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">

</div>
<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/trim-boosts-ssd-performance-and-longevity/" target="_blank">TRIM is one of the most important features</a> to keep your SSDs healthy. It's a background command that allows your operating system to tell the SSD which data blocks are no longer in use and can be cleared. Without TRIM, deleted files leave residual data behind, which can clutter the disk and eventually degrade performance.</p>    <p>To ensure that TRIM is active on your Windows system, launch Command Prompt/PowerShell and run the following command: <strong><em>fsutil behavior query DisableDeleteNotify</em></strong></p>    <p>If the output after running the above command is 0, TRIM is enabled and working as usual. If the output is 1, that means TRIM is disabled, and you need to turn it on by running this command: <strong><em>fsutil behavior set DisableDeleteNotify 0</em></strong></p>    <p>TRIM might seem like a minor tweak, but enabling it ensures that the drive maintains high write speeds and reduces the chance of write amplification.</p>    <h2>
Always leaving 10–20% free space
</h2><h3>
Don't fill your NVMe SSD to the brim
</h3>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p>One of the most overlooked tips to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ways-to-extend-your-ssds-lifespan/" target="_blank">extend your SSD's lifespan</a> is simply not maxing it out. While it's tempting to fill every single byte of your expensive NVMe drive, leaving some breathing room is beneficial. Unlike traditional hard drives, SSDs rely on free space to efficiently manage data. Leaving 10-20% of the space empty allows the SSDs to spread writes evenly — a process called wear leveling.</p>    <p>When the drive is nearly full, it has fewer empty blocks for writing new data. This will force it to erase and rewrite the few available blocks more frequently, leading to flash memory wearing out faster. To be honest, it's not that noticeable, but in the long run, it can lead to performance slowdowns.</p>    <p>I personally haven't set any hard limit to restrict my SSD to only 80% of its capacity, but I try to keep it that way, and you should, too, to get the most out of it in the long run.</p>    <h2>
Keeping the NVMe drive cool
</h2><h3>
Heat is the enemy of flash drives
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="CrystalDiskInfo showing disk temperature and high temperature alarm alert feature" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/crystaldiskinfo-showing-disk-temperature-and-high-temperature-alarm-alert-feature.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Despite not having moving parts, SSDs – especially NVMe models – can get hot, especially when installed next to GPUs or in cramped cases. If the drive regularly crosses 70°C, it might throttle performance to prevent damage, which actually defeats the whole purpose of having an NVMe drive. In the worst-case scenario, long-term exposure to high temperatures can also degrade NAND cells.</p>    <p>To monitor temperature, you can use free tools like <strong>CrystalDiskInfo</strong>, especially during heavy file transfer, software installations, or gaming. Add heatsinks if the temperature is constantly up. If the temperature rises even with light usage, improve the case airflow.</p>    <h2>
Never defragmenting it
</h2><h3>
Defragmentation is for HDDs only
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A screenshot showing the SSD listed in Windows Defrag program." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/ssd-listed-in-windows-defrag-program.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Defragmenting the hard disk used to be a standard maintenance task and is one of the habits that have stuck from the HDD era, but it doesn't apply to SSDs. While defragmenting a spinning drive reduces physical seek times, since SSDs have no moving parts, the file defragmentation doesn't matter. In fact, it can reduce their lifespan by adding unnecessary write cycles. Generally, Windows keeps defrag off on SSDs, and it's smart enough to optimize them with TRIM instead.</p>    <h2>
Avoiding heavy write workloads
</h2><h3>
Minimize constant rewriting
</h3>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p>SSDs generally have a limited number of write cycles per cell. For a regular user, this isn't a huge concern, and their SSDs will last a long time without issue. But if your system constantly writes to disk, the wear adds up. For example, if you are a video editor, a coder, or hosting a database on your SSD, your workload is pretty demanding, and the limited write cycles can be a concern.</p>    <p>Instead of using your primary SSD for everything, utilize secondary storage drives for tasks like moving temporary files or downloading. You can also adjust your browser settings to store cache on a different drive. These actions will prevent continuous writes to your main NVMe SSD, thereby allowing you to get the most out of it.</p>    <h2>
Monitoring the SSD's health regularly
</h2><h3>
Catch issues early
</h3>

</div>
<p>It's true that SSDs are durable and, in general, don't fail easily, especially the NVMe type, but it's a good idea to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-check-ssd-health-windows-pc/" target="_blank">keep an eye on their health</a>, and it's not that complicated. This will help you catch issues early, prepare for them, and save your important data. Every few months, check metrics like total writes, drive temperature, and SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) status.</p>    <p>I personally use the free <strong>CrystalDiskInfo</strong> app, which is sufficiently informative. Other options are <strong>Smartmontools </strong>and brand-specific apps like <strong>Samsung Magician</strong>.</p>    <h3>

Leaving 10-20% of the space empty allows the SSDs to spread writes evenly — a process called wear leveling.</p>    <p>When the drive is nearly full, it has fewer empty blocks for writing new data. This will force it to erase and rewrite the few available blocks more frequently, leading to flash memory wearing out faster. To be honest, it's not that noticeable, but in the long run, it can lead to performance slowdowns.</p>    <p>I personally haven't set any hard limit to restrict my SSD to only 80% of its capacity, but I try to keep it that way, and you should, too, to get the most out of it in the long run.</p>    <h2>
Keeping the NVMe drive cool
</h2><h3>
Heat is the enemy of flash drives
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="CrystalDiskInfo showing disk temperature and high temperature alarm alert feature" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/crystaldiskinfo-showing-disk-temperature-and-high-temperature-alarm-alert-feature.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Despite not having moving parts, SSDs – especially NVMe models – can get hot, especially when installed next to GPUs or in cramped cases. If the drive regularly crosses 70°C, it might throttle performance to prevent damage, which actually defeats the whole purpose of having an NVMe drive. In the worst-case scenario, long-term exposure to high temperatures can also degrade NAND cells.</p>    <p>To monitor temperature, you can use free tools like <strong>CrystalDiskInfo</strong>, especially during heavy file transfer, software installations, or gaming. Add heatsinks if the temperature is constantly up. If the temperature rises even with light usage, improve the case airflow.</p>    <h2>
Never defragmenting it
</h2><h3>
Defragmentation is for HDDs only
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A screenshot showing the SSD listed in Windows Defrag program." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/ssd-listed-in-windows-defrag-program.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Defragmenting the hard disk used to be a standard maintenance task and is one of the habits that have stuck from the HDD era, but it doesn't apply to SSDs. While defragmenting a spinning drive reduces physical seek times, since SSDs have no moving parts, the file defragmentation doesn't matter. In fact, it can reduce their lifespan by adding unnecessary write cycles. Generally, Windows keeps defrag off on SSDs, and it's smart enough to optimize them with TRIM instead.</p>    <h2>
Avoiding heavy write workloads
</h2><h3>
Minimize constant rewriting
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1867866231" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1867866231" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1867866231" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1867866231" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1867866231-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>SSDs generally have a limited number of write cycles per cell. For a regular user, this isn't a huge concern, and their SSDs will last a long time without issue. But if your system constantly writes to disk, the wear adds up. For example, if you are a video editor, a coder, or hosting a database on your SSD, your workload is pretty demanding, and the limited write cycles can be a concern.</p>    <p>Instead of using your primary SSD for everything, utilize secondary storage drives for tasks like moving temporary files or downloading. You can also adjust your browser settings to store cache on a different drive. These actions will prevent continuous writes to your main NVMe SSD, thereby allowing you to get the most out of it.</p>    <h2>
Monitoring the SSD's health regularly
</h2><h3>
Catch issues early
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="CrystalDiskInfo app" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/crystaldiskinfo-app.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>It's true that SSDs are durable and, in general, don't fail easily, especially the NVMe type, but it's a good idea to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-check-ssd-health-windows-pc/" target="_blank">keep an eye on their health</a>, and it's not that complicated. This will help you catch issues early, prepare for them, and save your important data. Every few months, check metrics like total writes, drive temperature, and SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) status.</p>    <p>I personally use the free <strong>CrystalDiskInfo</strong> app, which is sufficiently informative. Other options are <strong>Smartmontools </strong>and brand-specific apps like <strong>Samsung Magician</strong>.</p>    <h3>
Following these smart habits will make SSDs last longer
</h3>
<p>NVMe SSDs are designed for speed, and most users won't wear one out for many years. They also don't require much upkeep. But a few small, aforementioned habits can go a long way and let you <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/7-ways-to-optimize-an-ssd-for-longevity-and-performance/" target="_blank">utilize your SSD drive's full potential</a>. This will help you get the most out of your NVMe investment.</p>    <p>I don't fret much about my SSDs, to be honest, but following these tricks has helped me maintain them and protect my data before a disk failure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Use separate networks
</h2><h3>
Let those smart devices keep to themselves
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="IoT network options on an Orbi 970 router" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/iot-network-sample-netgear-orbi-970.jpeg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> I can’t emphasize enough the importance of using a separate network for your smart home devices. Your smart devices are constantly exchanging information, making them vulnerable to a data breach or interference with devices (and your personal data) on your main network. You can create a separate network for your smart devices in a few ways.</p>        <ol>
<li>
<strong>Guest Network</strong>: The easiest way to create a separate network for your devices is to use your router's guest network option. Create a unique password, and the guest network will use a different SSID than your main network, adding another layer of security.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Split your bands</strong>: Though this option may be a little trickier to navigate, you can split your dual-band router into separate SSIDs, putting your everyday devices on the 5GHz (or 6GHz if you have a Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7 router) and your smart devices on the 2.4GHz band. This option will reduce bandwidth interference, since most smart devices operate on the 2.4GHz band, but you’ll have to toggle back and forth between networks if you’re trying to control a device on that band.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Virtual local area networks (VLANs)</strong>: You can segment your home network via <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lans-finally-fixed-my-smart-home-headaches/" target="_blank">VLANs</a> and efficiently group your IoT devices on a dedicated 2.4 GHz band. You can configure a VLAN on your router and create firewall rules to monitor traffic between your network and the internet. If you’re so inclined, you can use a Home Assistant to keep your smart devices disconnected from the internet.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>
Use the WPA3 protocol
</h2><div>
<h3>It's the safest security standard for a reason</h3>
<img alt="Choose between AES or a combo of TKIP+AES encryption method for password" data-image-id="335406" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/03/choose-wpa-encryption.jpg">
<h2></h2>
The latest router security standard is WPA3, which is universally supported on Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 routers. If you don’t have a newer router, you can use a mix of standards, which I recommend doing to make it easier to connect older devices to your network.
<div>Not all smart devices support WPA3, so you may have to segment your IoT network further to separate WPA3-supporting devices from those that don't.</div>
You can use mixed WPA standards by logging into your router's settings and adjusting the security settings. If you create a separate network for IoT devices, you can use WPA3 on that network—but make sure your devices support it. WPA3 includes several improvements to security practices, including enhanced encryption and stronger security for smart home devices.</div><h2>
Multi-factor authentication and unique passwords
</h2><h3>
Don't rely on the default settings
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Check password safety in vaultwarden" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/08/data-breach-password-check.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<div>It’s probably a given that you should change the default password and username and use a unique, strong password for each device. You should do that regularly, and if you’re worried about forgetting your passwords, use a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-dozens-of-password-managers-keep-coming-back-to-open-source-tool/">password manager</a> to generate and store those passwords in one place.
Plus, if you turn on two-factor authentication, you can add an extra layer of security to your devices should those passwords be compromised. You may have to turn this feature on manually, but it is worth doing so. At least you’ll have to enter a second code via your phone, email, or an app, and at most, it’ll be more difficult for your accounts to be compromised.</div><div>
<h2>Turn on automatic updates</h2>
<h3>Updates come with essential security features</h3>
<img alt="Shows UniGetUI available software updates to install" data-image-id="327254" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/02/unigetui-app-updates.png">
<div>Check that your devices can download and install regular software updates. Unfortunately, that feature may not be available on all devices, so you’ll have to check back regularly. In either case, smart devices may not be receiving the latest software updates, making them especially vulnerable to security breaches, according to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.14367">New York University study analyzing public data</a>. That’s further reason you should be taking other steps to secure your devices and your network.</div>
<h2>Turn off extra features</h2>
<h3>You probably don't need them anway</h3>
<img alt="Installing Home Assistant Voice PE" data-image-id="348802" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/home-assistant-voice-app-setup-installing.jpg">
<div>Many smart devices often come equipped with extra features you don’t actually need for their primary functions. For example, cloud connectivity syncs your data online, and a voice assistant lets you control your device with voice commands—though many devices have to be “always listening” to work effectively. You’ll be better off without those features on.
Similarly, when you’re not using a device, turn it off. If your IoT devices are connected to the internet, you can free up bandwidth that way.
<h2>Block internet access</h2>
<h3>Keeping your devices offline is the most secure option</h3>
<div>

</div>
Not all smart devices need to connect to the internet to work effectively, and keeping your IoT devices cut off from manufacturer servers is a guaranteed way for you to maintain control over your personal data. You can build a functional, completely offline smart home using <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> to control devices and functions, and rest easy knowing your devices won’t be compromised or share your data without your knowledge.
<h3>Your data and network security aren't worth the risk</h3>
Some of these steps may seem like overkill, but the truth is, IoT devices are an understudied and under-regulated sector of a growing industry, especially as we begin to integrate them with AI. Your home should be a safe place, not a potential site for hacking or sensitive data leaks.</div>

<div>It’s probably a given that you should change the default password and username and use a unique, strong password for each device. You should do that regularly, and if you’re worried about forgetting your passwords, use a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-dozens-of-password-managers-keep-coming-back-to-open-source-tool/">password manager</a> to generate and store those passwords in one place.
Plus, if you turn on two-factor authentication, you can add an extra layer of security to your devices should those passwords be compromised. You may have to turn this feature on manually, but it is worth doing so. At least you’ll have to enter a second code via your phone, email, or an app, and at most, it’ll be more difficult for your accounts to be compromised.</div><div>
<h2>Turn on automatic updates</h2>
<h3>Updates come with essential security features</h3>
<img alt="Shows UniGetUI available software updates to install" data-image-id="327254" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/02/unigetui-app-updates.png">
<div>Check that your devices can download and install regular software updates. Unfortunately, that feature may not be available on all devices, so you’ll have to check back regularly. In either case, smart devices may not be receiving the latest software updates, making them especially vulnerable to security breaches, according to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.14367">New York University study analyzing public data</a>. That’s further reason you should be taking other steps to secure your devices and your network.</div>
<h2>Turn off extra features</h2>
<h3>You probably don't need them anway</h3>
<img alt="Installing Home Assistant Voice PE" data-image-id="348802" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/home-assistant-voice-app-setup-installing.jpg">
<div>Many smart devices often come equipped with extra features you don’t actually need for their primary functions. For example, cloud connectivity syncs your data online, and a voice assistant lets you control your device with voice commands—though many devices have to be “always listening” to work effectively. You’ll be better off without those features on.
Similarly, when you’re not using a device, turn it off. If your IoT devices are connected to the internet, you can free up bandwidth that way.
<h2>Block internet access</h2>
<h3>Keeping your devices offline is the most secure option</h3>

</div>
Not all smart devices need to connect to the internet to work effectively, and keeping your IoT devices cut off from manufacturer servers is a guaranteed way for you to maintain control over your personal data. You can build a functional, completely offline smart home using <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> to control devices and functions, and rest easy knowing your devices won’t be compromised or share your data without your knowledge.
<h3>Your data and network security aren't worth the risk</h3>
Some of these steps may seem like overkill, but the truth is, IoT devices are an understudied and under-regulated sector of a growing industry, especially as we begin to integrate them with AI. Your home should be a safe place, not a potential site for hacking or sensitive data leaks.</div>

<p>Immich is a slight step up in terms of technical knowledge compared to Wallos and OmniTools, since it is a service composed of multiple containers. Don't let this dissuade you, though; it just means you can't set it up with a Docker run command — instead, you need to use Docker Compose.</p>    <p>This involves using a Docker Compose .YML file and a.ENV file, and running the Docker command from the relevant folder in your terminal, but Immich provides great example files you can use. These files require minimal tweaking, making Immich great for beginners who aren't very familiar with compose file syntax.</p>    <p>When I created my Immich containers, I just changed the time zone settings and default password. I used a slightly different process than the steps in the <a href="https://docs.immich.app/overview/quick-start/" target="_blank">documentation</a> because I was using Windows rather than Linux.</p>    <p>For example, instead of using commands to create the relevant folder and files, I created the folder in Windows' File Explorer. I saved the example files in the documentation to the new folder (renaming <strong>example.env</strong> to just <strong>.env</strong>), made the relevant tweaks using a text editor, then launched Command Prompt in the folder and ran the command <strong>docker compose up -d</strong>.</p>    <p>In no time, I was able to get Immich running despite my newness to self-hosting. I recommend this container to beginners because it offers plenty of functionality, yet remains incredibly powerful and useful without requiring much technical knowledge. You should note, though, that you won't be able to access it from outside your home network without additional knowledge and configuration.</p>

</div>
<p>There are a few things I like about the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/rwmarkable-simple-self-hosted-checklists/" target="_blank">checklist and note-taking app Rwmarkable</a>: its documentation is detailed, its example compose file includes helpful notes, and its developer is incredibly responsive to GitHub posts.</p>    <p>I also like that it lets you create notes however you like, including using a rich text editor. This also makes it easy to copy and paste content, such as tables, from the web, which is one of the frustrations I've had with some Markdown and open-source tools in the past.</p>    <p>But besides the software itself being very user-friendly, the container is also very easy to deploy. This is one of the more recent services I've deployed, so I understood more of what was going on in the commands and compose file. However, I also didn't need to tweak anything to get it working, which makes it useful for beginners.</p>

<h3>
Self-hosting can be easy with the right containers
</h3>
<p>There are some basic things you will need to know to get started with self-hosting, such as how to access your command line and launch Docker (though Docker Desktop provides a GUI). But those skills can be learned in less than an afternoon through online tutorials, allowing you to get started with container self-hosting incredibly quickly.</p>    <p>I know because that's what I did without any coding, Docker, or networking experience — and with minimal exposure to Linux. This doesn't mean there weren't hiccups along the way, but these containers have been some of the easiest to deploy in my experience, while still providing useful functionality.</p>]]>

<h3>
Self-hosting can be easy with the right containers
</h3>
<p>There are some basic things you will need to know to get started with self-hosting, such as how to access your command line and launch Docker (though Docker Desktop provides a GUI). But those skills can be learned in less than an afternoon through online tutorials, allowing you to get started with container self-hosting incredibly quickly.</p>    <p>I know because that's what I did without any coding, Docker, or networking experience — and with minimal exposure to Linux. This doesn't mean there weren't hiccups along the way, but these containers have been some of the easiest to deploy in my experience, while still providing useful functionality.</p>]]>
    </description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I've interacted with different services over the past year, I've realized that there are plenty of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-people-over-simplify-self-hosting/" target="_blank">things that people over-simplify about self-hosting</a>. This includes the technical skills often required, as well as the many ways to self-host various software.</p>    <p>I'm glad I chose Docker containers for my self-hosting journey, since they let me use the hardware I already had. That said, this doesn't mean every service is easy to deploy — some require certain skills and knowledge. However, with these self-hosted containers, even very new beginners can get started easily.</p>    <h2>

I know it's a great container to try for beginners because it was the very first self-hosted app I tried, and I was able to get it up and running with minimal self-hosting knowledge using Docker Desktop.</p>    <p>You can get it started using either a Docker run command or Docker Compose. Once it's started, use your machine's IP address and the container's port (defaulting to http://localhost:8282) to access the service. There, you can set up your profile information and password.</p>    <p>The reason I suggest it for beginners is that you don't need to know anything about networking, coding, or database intricacies to get it working.</p>

<p>If you're looking for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lesser-known-open-source-projects-save-money/" target="_blank">open-source tools that can save you money</a>, then OmniTools gives you access to utility tools that usually require a paid subscription or premium software. It's also dead simple to set up in a container.</p>    <p>You can see if any of its tools appeal to you before choosing to self-host it by visiting the <a href="https://omnitools.app/" target="_blank">OmniTools website</a>. It has a variety of image tools (including compression, conversion, and background removal) and useful PDF tools. It also has a variety of video and audio tools, along with other handy utilities.</p>    <p>While you can find some of these tools spread across different websites, OmniTools has a few benefits. First off, because you're self-hosting it, your data is under your control. You don't have to worry about malicious files or your data being used to train algorithms. Secondly, all these tools are consolidated into a single, lightweight utility.</p>    <p>Usually, when it comes to self-hosting, privacy benefits come at the cost of convenience. Many tools require you to have quite a bit of technical knowledge, too. But with OmniTools, you can easily get access to some pretty useful utilities without much technical knowledge at all.</p>

    <itunes:summary>
      <![CDATA[<p>The VS Code marketplace is a fantastic place, but let’s be honest, it’s also an endless pit of distraction. You likely have dozens of extensions installed right now, many of which you rarely use, secretly slowing down your editor and workflow.</p>    <p>If your goal is truly to write code faster, you don’t need more tools; you need the right tools. This post cuts through the noise. I have stripped away themes, the icons, and the niche language helpers to focus on the pure mechanics of speed.</p>    <p>I have <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/vs-code-extensions-that-react-to-your-mistakes/" target="_blank">narrowed down hundreds of options</a> to just three essential VS Code extensions that fundamentally change your interaction with code and eliminate friction.</p>    <h2>
Tabnine
</h2><h3>
AI completes your entire lines
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Tabnine VS Code extension" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/08/best-vs-code-extensions-for-web-development-2.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> When I look back at my coding history, the hours I have wasted on repetitive typing, searching for common syntax, or just writing out boilerplate code are mind-boggling.</p>    <p>That all changed when I started using Tabnine. Frankly, this isn’t just an auto-complete tool; it’s the closest thing I have to a mind-reading, highly efficient co-pilot sitting right inside your editor.</p>    <p>Instead of suggesting single words or simple variable names, Tabnine uses advanced AI to analyze my code and predict entire lines or even full blocks of code based on context.</p>    <p>I will start typing a comment describing a function – say, ‘create a function to calculate the average’ – and before I have finished the sentence, Tabnine presents the finished function body, complete with loop logic and a return statement.</p>    <p>The productivity gain here is massive. I’m no longer focusing my energy on mechanical keystrokes; I’m focusing on the logic and structure of the problem. It instantly handles all the boring stuff and lets me write meaningful code much faster.</p>    <p>If you want to cut your typing time in half and eliminate the constant distraction of looking up how to write a simple utility function, this is the one extension you can’t skip.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>Now, do note that Tabnine runs on a freemium model where the most powerful features are paid.</p>    </div>

</div>
</div>
<p> I chose to elaborate on Tabnine because of its strong focus on privacy and enterprise features, but let’s have a quick word about its main competitor and other AI titan in the VS Code world: GitHub Copilot.</p>    <p>Copilot is the benchmark for sheer, raw completion power. If you prioritize expansive completion and you are already deeply integrated into the GitHub ecosystem, Copilot might feel even more seamless.</p>    <p>Ultimately, both of these AI assistants deliver the single biggest boost you can add to your <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-vs-code-is-the-best-text-editor-even-if-youre-not-a-developer/" target="_blank">boring VS Code editor</a> today. If you are still undecided, I encourage you to try both.</p>    <h2>
GitLens
</h2><h3>
See code history instantly
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1688042518" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1688042518" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1688042518" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1688042518" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1688042518-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The biggest slowdown in my workday isn’t writing new code – it’s trying to figure out old code. Who wrote this function? Why did they change this line last week?</p>    <p>Before GitLens, answering those questions meant stopping what I was doing, opening the terminal, typing a bunch of Git commands, and scrolling through logs. It broke my focus every single time.</p>    <p>This extension completely supercharges VS Code’s already great Git integration. The moment I open any file in my repository, GitLens instantly gives me inline blame annotations. I can see the author, the commit hash, and the date right at the end of every single line.</p>    <p>I can just hover over a line, and a tiny pop-up tells me everything I need to know about the change.

      <![CDATA[<p>The VS Code marketplace is a fantastic place, but let’s be honest, it’s also an endless pit of distraction. You likely have dozens of extensions installed right now, many of which you rarely use, secretly slowing down your editor and workflow.</p>    <p>If your goal is truly to write code faster, you don’t need more tools; you need the right tools. This post cuts through the noise. I have stripped away themes, the icons, and the niche language helpers to focus on the pure mechanics of speed.</p>    <p>I have <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/vs-code-extensions-that-react-to-your-mistakes/" target="_blank">narrowed down hundreds of options</a> to just three essential VS Code extensions that fundamentally change your interaction with code and eliminate friction.</p>    <h2>
Tabnine
</h2><h3>
AI completes your entire lines
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Tabnine VS Code extension" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/08/best-vs-code-extensions-for-web-development-2.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> When I look back at my coding history, the hours I have wasted on repetitive typing, searching for common syntax, or just writing out boilerplate code are mind-boggling.</p>    <p>That all changed when I started using Tabnine. Frankly, this isn’t just an auto-complete tool; it’s the closest thing I have to a mind-reading, highly efficient co-pilot sitting right inside your editor.</p>    <p>Instead of suggesting single words or simple variable names, Tabnine uses advanced AI to analyze my code and predict entire lines or even full blocks of code based on context.</p>    <p>I will start typing a comment describing a function – say, ‘create a function to calculate the average’ – and before I have finished the sentence, Tabnine presents the finished function body, complete with loop logic and a return statement.</p>    <p>The productivity gain here is massive. I’m no longer focusing my energy on mechanical keystrokes; I’m focusing on the logic and structure of the problem. It instantly handles all the boring stuff and lets me write meaningful code much faster.</p>    <p>If you want to cut your typing time in half and eliminate the constant distraction of looking up how to write a simple utility function, this is the one extension you can’t skip.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">

<div><p>Now, do note that Tabnine runs on a freemium model where the most powerful features are paid.</p>    </div>

</div>
</div>
<p> I chose to elaborate on Tabnine because of its strong focus on privacy and enterprise features, but let’s have a quick word about its main competitor and other AI titan in the VS Code world: GitHub Copilot.</p>    <p>Copilot is the benchmark for sheer, raw completion power. If you prioritize expansive completion and you are already deeply integrated into the GitHub ecosystem, Copilot might feel even more seamless.</p>    <p>Ultimately, both of these AI assistants deliver the single biggest boost you can add to your <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-vs-code-is-the-best-text-editor-even-if-youre-not-a-developer/" target="_blank">boring VS Code editor</a> today.

<p>The biggest slowdown in my workday isn’t writing new code – it’s trying to figure out old code. Who wrote this function? Why did they change this line last week?</p>    <p>Before GitLens, answering those questions meant stopping what I was doing, opening the terminal, typing a bunch of Git commands, and scrolling through logs. It broke my focus every single time.</p>    <p>This extension completely supercharges VS Code’s already great Git integration. The moment I open any file in my repository, GitLens instantly gives me inline blame annotations. I can see the author, the commit hash, and the date right at the end of every single line.</p>    <p>I can just hover over a line, and a tiny pop-up tells me everything I need to know about the change. The left sidebar gets a powerful new view where I can explore file history, check out branches, and compare two commits with a click.</p>    <p>Overall, GitLens removes the context-switching penalty that comes with investigating code history.</p>    <h2>

      <![CDATA[<p>For years now, "SBMM" has been a four-letter curse on every <em>Call of Duty</em> lobby. Skill-based matchmaking isn't inherently wrong, though. In fact, it allows for more players to feel comfortable in games, but after <em>Call of Duty </em>introduced their current, stricter SBMM in <em>Modern Warfare 2019</em>, the community has found an immense number of problems with it. The unpredictability that made <em>Call of Duty</em> feel so special in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-the-playstation-3-xbox-360-era-was-best-for-gaming/" target="_blank">the Xbox 360 era</a> felt like it had been stripped away with the new SBMM model.</p>    <p>With <em>Black Ops 7 l</em>ess than a month away, though, Treyarch had major good news for a huge part of the <em>COD </em>fanbase. They've done something many thought would never happen — they've walked back SBMM for casual play. In a move that almost feels rebellious today, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>is going to be going back to the old days of chaos and trash talk, and the lobbies may finally start feeling like playgrounds instead of exam halls now.</p>    <h2>
Seven years later, SBMM is finally going away from COD lobbies
</h2><h3>
Treyarch has confirmed no SBMM at launch for BO7
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-286319663" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-286319663" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-286319663" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-286319663" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-286319663-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>For nearly a decade, SBMM has been a silent puppeteer behind every frustrating death and one-sided loss in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer/" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty </em>multiplayer lobbies</a>. You'd have a great match, drop 40 kills, maybe get a nuke, and then suddenly, the next round feels like you're in a professional tournament with caffeinated bunny-hopping rabbits who can see you through walls. The constant push-and-pull effect drained the joy out of casually queuing up for a multiplayer match in any lobby.</p>    <p>Now, <em>Black Ops 7</em> is marking a seismic shift in that philosophy. The idea that your next match might finally depend on luck and momentum instead of an invisible skill algorithm is honestly refreshing. <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1976286062545862763" target="_blank">Treyarch finally seems to understand</a> that matchmaking should mix people up instead of caging them in, because balance can often just make a game boring instead of better.</p>    <h2>
Killing SBMM is a win for both casuals and pros
</h2><h3>
Open lobbies are where room for most growth lies
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1695833375" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1695833375" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1695833375" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1695833375" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1695833375-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>SBMM, for all its good intentions, often punishes improvement. The moment you got good, the game threw you into sweat lobbies so relentless that it felt like a tax on playing good. Instead of growth and the joy attached to it, you'd instead end up feeling exhaustion. Now, <a href="https://gamerant.com/call-duty-black-ops-7-cod-open-beta-sbmm-change-good/" target="_blank">facing unpredictable opponents</a> and weird team compositions would end up keeping your reflexes sharp and your strategies dynamic.</p>    <p>With<em> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-needs-to-be-harsher-against-cheating/" target="_blank">Black Ops 7</a></em> loosening the screws a bit by giving us open lobbies with no SBMM at launch, the game finally presents the freedom to fail spectacularly, try goofy builds, and build rivalries with the same players over and over again through persistent lobbies. No more going back to the lobby to queue up again based on your last match's results.</p>    <h2>
Persistent lobbies will make camaraderie return
</h2><h3>
It's time to make rivalries great again
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-2053985865" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-2053985865" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-2053985865" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-2053985865" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-2053985865-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>A long time ago, lobbies used to matter, because when you run into the same squad again and again, you'd form a grudging sense of respect for the guy who kept no-scoping you. Other times, you'd feel your golden hair coming on, on the edge of a Super Saiyan transformation as you readied up for a silent rematch with the team that just barely beat you. That's what's coming back with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-which-to-buy/" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>.</p>    <p>Persistent lobbies are a very underrated feature, even though they used to be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-things-everybody-does-wrong-in-call-of-duty-multiplayer-all-the-time/" target="_blank">the soul of multiplayer gaming</a>. They made post-match voice chats full of adrenaline, laughter, and salty revenge declarations. When lobby disbanding became the norm, it felt like we lost that spark, and I couldn't be happier that persistent lobbies are coming back to the game. That's where the most room for growth lies.</p>    <h2>
This was a long-overdue change
</h2><h3>
Have they done this out of nervousness about Battlefield 6's success?

<p>This is a rare moment when community outcry didn't fall on deaf ears. For years, <em>COD</em> fans have petitioned for changes to SBMM, and for years, it felt like no one was listening. Now, Treyarch seems to have realized that listening doesn't mean surrendering. Instead, it means adapting. Now, is this change only here because, as some might believe, Activision has been nervous about <em>Battlefield 6</em>'s <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-online-open-beta-good-but-has-problems/" target="_blank">insane concurrent peak in its beta</a> and its <em>Call of Duty</em>-like launch sales?</p>    <p>It's certainly possible. After all, they even made <em>Black Ops 6</em> entirely free for the first week of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-review/" target="_blank"><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s release</a> in the hopes of getting some players away from EA's product, which is clearly in its strongest avatar ever. Regardless, this is what competition is all about — one good product raises the standard, forcing the complacent to make long-overdue changes to stay at the top of the chain. If history is any indication, <em>Battlefield 6 </em>might still <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-will-outsell-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">struggle to outsell <em>Black Ops 7</em></a>, because even the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ranking-all-the-battlefield-games-before-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">best <em>Battlefield</em> games</a> that have gone up against the 'worse' <em>COD </em>games have struggled to outsell them. Regardless, the bottom line remains that <em>Black Ops 7</em>'s multiplayer is going to be better than ever.</p>

The death of SBMM could spell a new dawn for COD
</h3>
<p>At long last, <em>Call of Duty </em>fans are getting something real to celebrate. By stripping away the cold efficiency of SBMM, Treyarch is reigniting that spark that made the series iconic in the first place. I'm not going so far as to say that the studio is choosing <em>soul over spreadsheets</em>, but the optimistic kid in me who loves a good old-fashion <em>COD</em> persistent lobby is beaming with excitement.</p>    <p><em>Black Ops </em>7 could very well be a turning point for the entire franchise, and if that's truly what's happening here, then this might just be the most important <em>Call of Duty </em>launch in a decade.</p>]]>
    </itunes:summary>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[<p>For years now, "SBMM" has been a four-letter curse on every <em>Call of Duty</em> lobby. Skill-based matchmaking isn't inherently wrong, though. In fact, it allows for more players to feel comfortable in games, but after <em>Call of Duty </em>introduced their current, stricter SBMM in <em>Modern Warfare 2019</em>, the community has found an immense number of problems with it. The unpredictability that made <em>Call of Duty</em> feel so special in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-the-playstation-3-xbox-360-era-was-best-for-gaming/" target="_blank">the Xbox 360 era</a> felt like it had been stripped away with the new SBMM model.</p>    <p>With <em>Black Ops 7 l</em>ess than a month away, though, Treyarch had major good news for a huge part of the <em>COD </em>fanbase. They've done something many thought would never happen — they've walked back SBMM for casual play. In a move that almost feels rebellious today, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>is going to be going back to the old days of chaos and trash talk, and the lobbies may finally start feeling like playgrounds instead of exam halls now.</p>    <h2>
Seven years later, SBMM is finally going away from COD lobbies
</h2><h3>
Treyarch has confirmed no SBMM at launch for BO7
</h3>

<p>For nearly a decade, SBMM has been a silent puppeteer behind every frustrating death and one-sided loss in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer/" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty </em>multiplayer lobbies</a>. You'd have a great match, drop 40 kills, maybe get a nuke, and then suddenly, the next round feels like you're in a professional tournament with caffeinated bunny-hopping rabbits who can see you through walls. The constant push-and-pull effect drained the joy out of casually queuing up for a multiplayer match in any lobby.</p>    <p>Now, <em>Black Ops 7</em> is marking a seismic shift in that philosophy. The idea that your next match might finally depend on luck and momentum instead of an invisible skill algorithm is honestly refreshing. <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1976286062545862763" target="_blank">Treyarch finally seems to understand</a> that matchmaking should mix people up instead of caging them in, because balance can often just make a game boring instead of better.</p>    <h2>
Killing SBMM is a win for both casuals and pros
</h2><h3>
Open lobbies are where room for most growth lies
</h3>

<p>SBMM, for all its good intentions, often punishes improvement. The moment you got good, the game threw you into sweat lobbies so relentless that it felt like a tax on playing good. Instead of growth and the joy attached to it, you'd instead end up feeling exhaustion. Now, <a href="https://gamerant.com/call-duty-black-ops-7-cod-open-beta-sbmm-change-good/" target="_blank">facing unpredictable opponents</a> and weird team compositions would end up keeping your reflexes sharp and your strategies dynamic.</p>    <p>With<em> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-needs-to-be-harsher-against-cheating/" target="_blank">Black Ops 7</a></em> loosening the screws a bit by giving us open lobbies with no SBMM at launch, the game finally presents the freedom to fail spectacularly, try goofy builds, and build rivalries with the same players over and over again through persistent lobbies. No more going back to the lobby to queue up again based on your last match's results.</p>    <h2>
Persistent lobbies will make camaraderie return
</h2><h3>
It's time to make rivalries great again
</h3>

<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-2053985865" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-2053985865" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-2053985865" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-2053985865" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-2053985865-img" data-gallery-type="">

<p>A long time ago, lobbies used to matter, because when you run into the same squad again and again, you'd form a grudging sense of respect for the guy who kept no-scoping you. Other times, you'd feel your golden hair coming on, on the edge of a Super Saiyan transformation as you readied up for a silent rematch with the team that just barely beat you. That's what's coming back with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-which-to-buy/" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>.</p>    <p>Persistent lobbies are a very underrated feature, even though they used to be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-things-everybody-does-wrong-in-call-of-duty-multiplayer-all-the-time/" target="_blank">the soul of multiplayer gaming</a>. They made post-match voice chats full of adrenaline, laughter, and salty revenge declarations. When lobby disbanding became the norm, it felt like we lost that spark, and I couldn't be happier that persistent lobbies are coming back to the game. That's where the most room for growth lies.</p>    <h2>
This was a long-overdue change
</h2><h3>
Have they done this out of nervousness about Battlefield 6's success?

<p>This is a rare moment when community outcry didn't fall on deaf ears. For years, <em>COD</em> fans have petitioned for changes to SBMM, and for years, it felt like no one was listening. Now, Treyarch seems to have realized that listening doesn't mean surrendering. Instead, it means adapting. Now, is this change only here because, as some might believe, Activision has been nervous about <em>Battlefield 6</em>'s <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-online-open-beta-good-but-has-problems/" target="_blank">insane concurrent peak in its beta</a> and its <em>Call of Duty</em>-like launch sales?</p>    <p>It's certainly possible. After all, they even made <em>Black Ops 6</em> entirely free for the first week of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-review/" target="_blank"><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s release</a> in the hopes of getting some players away from EA's product, which is clearly in its strongest avatar ever. Regardless, this is what competition is all about — one good product raises the standard, forcing the complacent to make long-overdue changes to stay at the top of the chain. If history is any indication, <em>Battlefield 6 </em>might still <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-will-outsell-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">struggle to outsell <em>Black Ops 7</em></a>, because even the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ranking-all-the-battlefield-games-before-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">best <em>Battlefield</em> games</a> that have gone up against the 'worse' <em>COD </em>games have struggled to outsell them. Regardless, the bottom line remains that <em>Black Ops 7</em>'s multiplayer is going to be better than ever.</p>

The death of SBMM could spell a new dawn for COD
</h3>
<p>At long last, <em>Call of Duty </em>fans are getting something real to celebrate. By stripping away the cold efficiency of SBMM, Treyarch is reigniting that spark that made the series iconic in the first place. I'm not going so far as to say that the studio is choosing <em>soul over spreadsheets</em>, but the optimistic kid in me who loves a good old-fashion <em>COD</em> persistent lobby is beaming with excitement.</p>    <p><em>Black Ops </em>7 could very well be a turning point for the entire franchise, and if that's truly what's happening here, then this might just be the most important <em>Call of Duty </em>launch in a decade.</p>]]>
    </description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years now, "SBMM" has been a four-letter curse on every <em>Call of Duty</em> lobby. Skill-based matchmaking isn't inherently wrong, though. In fact, it allows for more players to feel comfortable in games, but after <em>Call of Duty </em>introduced their current, stricter SBMM in <em>Modern Warfare 2019</em>, the community has found an immense number of problems with it. The unpredictability that made <em>Call of Duty</em> feel so special in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-the-playstation-3-xbox-360-era-was-best-for-gaming/" target="_blank">the Xbox 360 era</a> felt like it had been stripped away with the new SBMM model.</p>    <p>With <em>Black Ops 7 l</em>ess than a month away, though, Treyarch had major good news for a huge part of the <em>COD </em>fanbase. They've done something many thought would never happen — they've walked back SBMM for casual play. In a move that almost feels rebellious today, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>is going to be going back to the old days of chaos and trash talk, and the lobbies may finally start feeling like playgrounds instead of exam halls now.</p>    <h2>
Seven years later, SBMM is finally going away from COD lobbies
</h2><h3>
Treyarch has confirmed no SBMM at launch for BO7
</h3>

<p>For nearly a decade, SBMM has been a silent puppeteer behind every frustrating death and one-sided loss in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer/" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty </em>multiplayer lobbies</a>. You'd have a great match, drop 40 kills, maybe get a nuke, and then suddenly, the next round feels like you're in a professional tournament with caffeinated bunny-hopping rabbits who can see you through walls. The constant push-and-pull effect drained the joy out of casually queuing up for a multiplayer match in any lobby.</p>    <p>Now, <em>Black Ops 7</em> is marking a seismic shift in that philosophy. The idea that your next match might finally depend on luck and momentum instead of an invisible skill algorithm is honestly refreshing. <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1976286062545862763" target="_blank">Treyarch finally seems to understand</a> that matchmaking should mix people up instead of caging them in, because balance can often just make a game boring instead of better.</p>    <h2>
Killing SBMM is a win for both casuals and pros
</h2><h3>
Open lobbies are where room for most growth lies

<p>SBMM, for all its good intentions, often punishes improvement. The moment you got good, the game threw you into sweat lobbies so relentless that it felt like a tax on playing good. Instead of growth and the joy attached to it, you'd instead end up feeling exhaustion. Now, <a href="https://gamerant.com/call-duty-black-ops-7-cod-open-beta-sbmm-change-good/" target="_blank">facing unpredictable opponents</a> and weird team compositions would end up keeping your reflexes sharp and your strategies dynamic.</p>    <p>With<em> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-needs-to-be-harsher-against-cheating/" target="_blank">Black Ops 7</a></em> loosening the screws a bit by giving us open lobbies with no SBMM at launch, the game finally presents the freedom to fail spectacularly, try goofy builds, and build rivalries with the same players over and over again through persistent lobbies. No more going back to the lobby to queue up again based on your last match's results.</p>    <h2>
Persistent lobbies will make camaraderie return
</h2><h3>
It's time to make rivalries great again
</h3>

<p>A long time ago, lobbies used to matter, because when you run into the same squad again and again, you'd form a grudging sense of respect for the guy who kept no-scoping you. Other times, you'd feel your golden hair coming on, on the edge of a Super Saiyan transformation as you readied up for a silent rematch with the team that just barely beat you. That's what's coming back with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-which-to-buy/" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>.</p>    <p>Persistent lobbies are a very underrated feature, even though they used to be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-things-everybody-does-wrong-in-call-of-duty-multiplayer-all-the-time/" target="_blank">the soul of multiplayer gaming</a>. They made post-match voice chats full of adrenaline, laughter, and salty revenge declarations. When lobby disbanding became the norm, it felt like we lost that spark, and I couldn't be happier that persistent lobbies are coming back to the game. That's where the most room for growth lies.</p>    <h2>
This was a long-overdue change
</h2><h3>
Have they done this out of nervousness about Battlefield 6's success?

<p>This is a rare moment when community outcry didn't fall on deaf ears. For years, <em>COD</em> fans have petitioned for changes to SBMM, and for years, it felt like no one was listening. Now, Treyarch seems to have realized that listening doesn't mean surrendering. Instead, it means adapting. Now, is this change only here because, as some might believe, Activision has been nervous about <em>Battlefield 6</em>'s <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-online-open-beta-good-but-has-problems/" target="_blank">insane concurrent peak in its beta</a> and its <em>Call of Duty</em>-like launch sales?</p>    <p>It's certainly possible. After all, they even made <em>Black Ops 6</em> entirely free for the first week of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-review/" target="_blank"><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s release</a> in the hopes of getting some players away from EA's product, which is clearly in its strongest avatar ever. Regardless, this is what competition is all about — one good product raises the standard, forcing the complacent to make long-overdue changes to stay at the top of the chain. If history is any indication, <em>Battlefield 6 </em>might still <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-will-outsell-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">struggle to outsell <em>Black Ops 7</em></a>, because even the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ranking-all-the-battlefield-games-before-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">best <em>Battlefield</em> games</a> that have gone up against the 'worse' <em>COD </em>games have struggled to outsell them. Regardless, the bottom line remains that <em>Black Ops 7</em>'s multiplayer is going to be better than ever.</p>

The death of SBMM could spell a new dawn for COD
</h3>
<p>At long last, <em>Call of Duty </em>fans are getting something real to celebrate. By stripping away the cold efficiency of SBMM, Treyarch is reigniting that spark that made the series iconic in the first place. I'm not going so far as to say that the studio is choosing <em>soul over spreadsheets</em>, but the optimistic kid in me who loves a good old-fashion <em>COD</em> persistent lobby is beaming with excitement.</p>    <p><em>Black Ops </em>7 could very well be a turning point for the entire franchise, and if that's truly what's happening here, then this might just be the most important <em>Call of Duty </em>launch in a decade.</p>]]></content:encoded>
