      <![CDATA[<p>Smart home security has come a long way, but most outdoor cameras still share one limitation – they can only track one thing at a time. If someone walks across your driveway while a delivery truck pulls up to the curb, chances are your camera will follow one and miss the other. <a href="https://valnet.biz/4h8RLh7" target="_blank">Baseus' Security X1 Pro</a>, an outdoor security camera designed with AI-powered dual tracking, solves this problem.</p>    <p>The Baseus Security X1 Pro, currently crowdfunding on <a href="https://valnet.biz/4h8RLh7" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, combines two independent 3K cameras, AI-driven subject detection, and solar-powered charging in a single device. It has already earned recognition at IFA 2025, winning a Smart Home Category Honoree Award, and is positioned as one of the most advanced consumer security cameras available today.</p>    <h2>

<p>The Baseus Security X1 Pro is designed for those seeking reliable home protection without blind spots or recurring subscription costs. Families can keep an eye on children playing outside while watching for deliveries, and remote workers can monitor their front doors from the comfort of their desks. Homeowners in rural areas will also benefit from wide coverage and solar power that eliminates the need for long cables.</p>    <p>The camera also offers simple installation and local storage (which means no ongoing fees). In short, the security camera adapts to many living situations to deliver consistent security.</p>
<h3>
Dual cameras for complete coverage
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="baseus security x1 pro lifestyle on wall" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baseus-security-x1-pro-lifestyle-on-wall.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<small>Credit:&nbsp;Baseus</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> The Baseus Security X1 Pro’s dual-lens design is its superpower. Instead of relying on one camera to monitor all activity, two independent cameras track multiple subjects simultaneously. Each lens has a 105-degree (horizontal) field of view with an additional 55 degrees of motorized panning.</p>    <p>This setup makes it possible to survey front and backyards with a single device. For example, the camera can provide coverage of your children playing nearby while keeping your driveway in view for deliveries – without blind spots.</p>    <p>Split-screen viewing in the Baseus Security app shows both perspectives in real time. This makes it easy to see what’s happening across your property without gaps in coverage or switching feeds.</p>    <h3>
Smarter AI tracking
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="baseus security x1 pro lifestyle ai tracking" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baseus-security-x1-pro-lifestyle-ai-tracking.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<small>Credit:&nbsp;Baseus</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> The Baseus Security X1 Pro does more than record. Its AI system uses both lenses to track motion as subjects move through the frame. Baseus calls this Live Cross-Cam AI Tracking. If someone walks from the left side of your yard into the right, the cameras coordinate so one seamlessly hands off tracking to the other.</p>    <p>This kind of handoff ensures you do not lose sight of important activity. For homeowners with wide lots, corner properties, or shared driveways, uninterrupted coverage is a major benefit.</p>    <p>The system also includes Dual Sentry and Patrol Modes. When on standby, passive infrared sensors remain alert. Once movement is detected, the cameras activate instantly and follow the subject. You can also set patrol intervals so the cameras rotate independently to scan for potential threats, providing continuous surveillance, even when nothing is happening.</p>    <h3>
3K clarity with night vision
</h3>
<p>Good resolution ensures recorded footage is useful. The Baseus Security X1 Pro records in 3K, providing enough detail to identify people, license plates, or packages. With the camera, you can zoom in and switch to color night vision to immediately determine what triggered the alert.</p>    <h3>
Solar power with a detachable panel
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="baseus security x1 pro solar panel, multiple views" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baseus-security-x1-pro-solar-panel.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<small>Credit:&nbsp;Baseus</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> Keeping a camera powered outdoors often requires running long cables or remembering to recharge. The Baseus Security X1 Pro takes a different approach with its detachable solar panel. The panel uses an automatic sun-tracking system that adjusts up to 120 degrees to absorb the maximum amount of light.</p>    <p>Baseus claims that just 20 minutes of sunlight is enough to keep the camera running for a full day. The built-in battery lasts up to 150 days on its own, ensuring coverage even in less-than-ideal conditions. For users in areas with unreliable power or those who want a low-maintenance setup, this solar approach is a big advantage.</p>    <h3>
Local storage with no subscription fees
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="baseus security x1 pro on a blue background with dollar signs" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baseus-security-x1-pro-blue-background-dollar-signs.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<small>Credit:&nbsp;Baseus</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> Many smart cameras lock advanced features behind monthly subscriptions. The Baseus Security X1 Pro takes a different approach by offering up to 512GB of local microSD storage with no recurring fees. AES and RSA encryption also ensure your data is secure and compliant with EN 18031 privacy standards.</p>    <p>This is especially useful if you want long-term storage without worrying about extra costs stacking up. Baseus even includes a complimentary memory card with early Kickstarter pledges, making it easier to get started right away.</p>    <h3>
Built for real-life environments
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="baseus-security-x1 pro pictured in rainy and snowy enviroments" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baseus-security-x1-pro-seasons.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<small>Credit:&nbsp;Baseus</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> Outdoor cameras need to handle tough conditions, and the Baseus Security X1 Pro is built with this in mind. The camera’s IP65 waterproof rating means it can withstand rain, snow, and temperatures ranging from -20℃ to 50℃. The ETFE solar surface allows over 95 percent UV light transmission, which improves durability and charging efficiency.</p>    <p>A flexible three-axis bracket also makes installation easier. Many homeowners struggle with mounting cameras on corners or angled walls. The camera’s bracket design allows for multiple viewing angles so that you can find the right position without compromise.</p>    <h3>
App control and two-way audio
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="baseus security x1 pro coverage showing full exterior coverage compared to other cameras" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baseus-security-x1-pro-coverage.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<small>Credit:&nbsp;Baseus</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> Everything ties together in the Baseus Security app. From the app, you can view live streams, replay past events, and receive instant notifications. The app also supports two-way audio to speak directly to visitors or deter unwanted activity without leaving the house.</p>    <p>For example, if a delivery arrives while you are away, you can use the camera to confirm the drop-off and even speak to the driver through your phone. And if motion is detected late at night, you can address it immediately instead of waiting until morning.</p>    <h2>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smart home security has come a long way, but most outdoor cameras still share one limitation – they can only track one thing at a time. If someone walks across your driveway while a delivery truck pulls up to the curb, chances are your camera will follow one and miss the other. <a href="https://valnet.biz/4h8RLh7" target="_blank">Baseus' Security X1 Pro</a>, an outdoor security camera designed with AI-powered dual tracking, solves this problem.</p>    <p>The Baseus Security X1 Pro, currently crowdfunding on <a href="https://valnet.biz/4h8RLh7" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, combines two independent 3K cameras, AI-driven subject detection, and solar-powered charging in a single device. It has already earned recognition at IFA 2025, winning a Smart Home Category Honoree Award, and is positioned as one of the most advanced consumer security cameras available today.</p>    <h2>

<p>The Baseus Security X1 Pro is designed for those seeking reliable home protection without blind spots or recurring subscription costs. Families can keep an eye on children playing outside while watching for deliveries, and remote workers can monitor their front doors from the comfort of their desks. Homeowners in rural areas will also benefit from wide coverage and solar power that eliminates the need for long cables.</p>    <p>The camera also offers simple installation and local storage (which means no ongoing fees). In short, the security camera adapts to many living situations to deliver consistent security.</p>
<h3>
Dual cameras for complete coverage
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="baseus security x1 pro lifestyle on wall" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baseus-security-x1-pro-lifestyle-on-wall.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<small>Credit:&nbsp;Baseus</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> The Baseus Security X1 Pro’s dual-lens design is its superpower. Instead of relying on one camera to monitor all activity, two independent cameras track multiple subjects simultaneously. Each lens has a 105-degree (horizontal) field of view with an additional 55 degrees of motorized panning.</p>    <p>This setup makes it possible to survey front and backyards with a single device. For example, the camera can provide coverage of your children playing nearby while keeping your driveway in view for deliveries – without blind spots.</p>    <p>Split-screen viewing in the Baseus Security app shows both perspectives in real time. This makes it easy to see what’s happening across your property without gaps in coverage or switching feeds.</p>    <h3>
Smarter AI tracking
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="baseus security x1 pro lifestyle ai tracking" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baseus-security-x1-pro-lifestyle-ai-tracking.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<small>Credit:&nbsp;Baseus</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> The Baseus Security X1 Pro does more than record. Its AI system uses both lenses to track motion as subjects move through the frame. Baseus calls this Live Cross-Cam AI Tracking. If someone walks from the left side of your yard into the right, the cameras coordinate so one seamlessly hands off tracking to the other.</p>    <p>This kind of handoff ensures you do not lose sight of important activity. For homeowners with wide lots, corner properties, or shared driveways, uninterrupted coverage is a major benefit.</p>    <p>The system also includes Dual Sentry and Patrol Modes. When on standby, passive infrared sensors remain alert. Once movement is detected, the cameras activate instantly and follow the subject. You can also set patrol intervals so the cameras rotate independently to scan for potential threats, providing continuous surveillance, even when nothing is happening.</p>    <h3>
3K clarity with night vision
</h3>
<p>Good resolution ensures recorded footage is useful. The Baseus Security X1 Pro records in 3K, providing enough detail to identify people, license plates, or packages. With the camera, you can zoom in and switch to color night vision to immediately determine what triggered the alert.</p>    <h3>
Solar power with a detachable panel
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="baseus security x1 pro solar panel, multiple views" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baseus-security-x1-pro-solar-panel.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<small>Credit:&nbsp;Baseus</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> Keeping a camera powered outdoors often requires running long cables or remembering to recharge. The Baseus Security X1 Pro takes a different approach with its detachable solar panel. The panel uses an automatic sun-tracking system that adjusts up to 120 degrees to absorb the maximum amount of light.</p>    <p>Baseus claims that just 20 minutes of sunlight is enough to keep the camera running for a full day. The built-in battery lasts up to 150 days on its own, ensuring coverage even in less-than-ideal conditions. For users in areas with unreliable power or those who want a low-maintenance setup, this solar approach is a big advantage.</p>    <h3>
Local storage with no subscription fees
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="baseus security x1 pro on a blue background with dollar signs" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baseus-security-x1-pro-blue-background-dollar-signs.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<small>Credit:&nbsp;Baseus</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> Many smart cameras lock advanced features behind monthly subscriptions. The Baseus Security X1 Pro takes a different approach by offering up to 512GB of local microSD storage with no recurring fees. AES and RSA encryption also ensure your data is secure and compliant with EN 18031 privacy standards.</p>    <p>This is especially useful if you want long-term storage without worrying about extra costs stacking up. Baseus even includes a complimentary memory card with early Kickstarter pledges, making it easier to get started right away.</p>    <h3>
Built for real-life environments
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="baseus-security-x1 pro pictured in rainy and snowy enviroments" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baseus-security-x1-pro-seasons.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<small>Credit:&nbsp;Baseus</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> Outdoor cameras need to handle tough conditions, and the Baseus Security X1 Pro is built with this in mind. The camera’s IP65 waterproof rating means it can withstand rain, snow, and temperatures ranging from -20℃ to 50℃. The ETFE solar surface allows over 95 percent UV light transmission, which improves durability and charging efficiency.</p>    <p>A flexible three-axis bracket also makes installation easier. Many homeowners struggle with mounting cameras on corners or angled walls. The camera’s bracket design allows for multiple viewing angles so that you can find the right position without compromise.</p>    <h3>
App control and two-way audio
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="baseus security x1 pro coverage showing full exterior coverage compared to other cameras" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baseus-security-x1-pro-coverage.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<small>Credit:&nbsp;Baseus</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> Everything ties together in the Baseus Security app. From the app, you can view live streams, replay past events, and receive instant notifications. The app also supports two-way audio to speak directly to visitors or deter unwanted activity without leaving the house.</p>    <p>For example, if a delivery arrives while you are away, you can use the camera to confirm the drop-off and even speak to the driver through your phone. And if motion is detected late at night, you can address it immediately instead of waiting until morning.</p>    <h2>

You can interact with Google Drive, Calendar, Gmail, and more.</p>    <p>Unfortunately, Copilot Actions is starting with "a narrow set of use cases", which means that your initial experience with this is going to be that you're told it can't do most of the things you want it to, an obstacle that can be difficult for services to overcome in future iterations. Indeed, it's hard to retrain users if they think the product just doesn't work.</p>    <h2>
Copilot is coming to gaming handhelds too

<p>Microsoft also introduced Gaming Copilot, available in beta on the new <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review/" target="_blank">Asus ROG Xbox Ally</a> series. The idea is that you'll be able to ask for help, get recommendations, and things like that.</p>    <p>Microsoft's announcement really didn't get into what Gaming Copilot can actually do, or why you'd want it. It seems like it's just searching the web for game tips, unlike HP's OMEN AI services that will actually help you fine-tune your system settings for optimal game performance.</p>

<p>Indeed, being that this is exclusive to gaming handhelds that, by definition, have a different power envelope than a console (there is no mention of this coming to Xbox consoles), you'd think optimizations would be a key value proposition for something like this.</p>    <p>Notably, however, is that the new ROG Xbox Ally handhelds are Copilot+ PCs, meaning they have powerful NPUs. That might be a reason for the exclusivity, at least for now.</p>    <p>Most of these features will arrive as an update to the Copilot app, while some will come to Windows Insiders a bit later. Again, Microsoft said that everything mentioned is opt-in.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p> Over the past few years, we've seen what happened to the first wave of online-capable devices, and it sends a pretty clear message.

In the case of the Nintendo Wii, purchased content can still be redownloaded, and the same goes for the Nintendo Wii U and 3DS that came later.

    <itunes:author><![CDATA[XDA[RSS+]]]></itunes:author>
    <itunes:summary>
      <![CDATA[<p>For years, Notion and Obsidian have dominated the knowledge management space, but let’s be honest: building a shared, reliable team wiki on them often feels slow, complex, and clunky. That frustration drove me to find a better way, and I discovered the answer in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-microsoft-loop-does-better-than-alternatives/" target="_blank">Microsoft Loop</a>.</p>    <p>We started using Microsoft Loop as our primary team wiki, and the results have been staggering. Forget complicated databases and confusing page architectures — Loop has proven to be 10x faster than the alternatives.</p>    <h2>
The problem with current wikis
</h2><h3>
The lag is real
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Notion table" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/04/reasons-notion-is-jack-of-all-trades-and-master-of-none-5.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> When it came to building a team wiki, Notion was naturally my first choice.

<p> The deep integration with Microsoft 365 is Loop's biggest competitive advantage over standalone tools.

My entire universe of work – the critical Excel spreadsheets, the polished PowerPoint presentations, and the detailed Word documents — all live right there in OneDrive.</p>    <p>That’s where the competition fails. Notion and Obsidian require frustrating, multistep embeds or manual file updates. Loop, however, just works.</p>    <p>I can build a wiki page, type<strong> /</strong> and start typing the name of an external file, and Loop instantly pulls it up from my OneDrive. The integration is smooth.</p>    <p>Plus, the entire Loop workspace itself utilizes OneDrive for its backend storage, which means everything syncs seamlessly across all my devices without me ever having to think about it (unlike Obsidian).</p>    <h2>

<p>The moment I truly realized Microsoft Loop was a superior wiki was when I looked at its core feature set. It isn’t a stripped-down tool; it has all the power I need to build a robust wiki, but without the baggage of templates, plugins, AI, or complicated automation.</p>    <p>I can instantly create structured data using Loop’s built-in tables, which function exactly like lightweight databases. With multiple column types, formulas, and different views, it has all the necessary ingredients for a functional wiki database.</p>    <p>And thanks to the modern block editor, the editing process is also fluid. For documentation, the support for Mermaid charts is a game-changer. I can quickly define a flow chart or a sequence diagram using simple text, and Loop renders a professional-looking visual right there on the page.</p>    <p>Overall, Loop gives me all the power and flexibility I need to create a professional, highly functional team wiki.</p>    <h2>

I can see their avatars right there, add a comment right next to a block, or better yet, just react to a block with a quick emoji to acknowledge or confirm information without interrupting the flow.</p>    <p>Loop components are the single biggest feature that gives it a massive speed advantage. I can take any self-contained piece of information — a checklist, a status table, a client database — and turn it into a Loop component.</p>    <p>I can then share that component directly into a Teams channel or an Outlook email.

Move over, Notion

<p>Overall, the era of slow team wikis is officially over.

<p>Portable monitors used to be quite expensive, but over the past few years, a variety of affordable options have appeared on Amazon that might make you do a double take at the price. This particular model has a 15.6-inch IPS panel and plenty of connectivity and only costs $45. You read that right, this monitor costs just $45 right now. So if you've been looking for a solution like this, this might be the one for you.</p>    <h2>

<p>For the most part, what you see is pretty much what you get here. It's a slim and compact 15.6-inch monitor with an IPS panel that offers plenty of connectivity and minimal compromises.

There's also a kickstand included that will allow you to adjust the viewing angle, and dual speakers for audio on the go. When connected to a PC or macOS product, you'll be able to duplicate the main display or use the portable monitor as an extension of the original desktop. </p>    <p>And since you have a USB-C port on the monitor, you can always use this for other compatible devices as well, like tablets, phones, and even <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-pc-gaming-handhelds/" target="_blank">PC gaming handhelds</a>. It can also be a vital tool if you're someone that's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/portable-monitor-useful-home-lab/" target="_blank">looking to set up a home lab</a>. If you're going to carry it with you, this monitor weighs 1.3 pounds and measures in at 0.3 inches thick. Overall, not a bad piece of tech for $45. </p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Having used air coolers for over 20 years, I wanted to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/air-cooler-to-liquid-cooler-not-the-upgrade-i-expected/" target="_blank">switch to an AIO liquid cooler</a> when building my current PC three years ago. There was probably no real justification for picking a white AIO over an air cooler, but I preferred the esthetic, and thought my CPU would love the extra cooling. Little did I know that things were about to go very wrong. Not only did I waste money on a needless AIO, but it also turned out to be worse-performing than a budget air cooler. The novelty of the white design didn't last long either, thanks to discoloration and highly visible dust deposits.</p>    <h2>

<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-regret-buying-the-ryzen-7-5700x/" target="_blank">I picked the Ryzen 7 5700X</a> for my build, a great processor for gaming and occasional productivity. Being a 65W processor, it didn't need a fancy AIO cooler — a budget air cooler would have been sufficient. However, I was on my quest to buy supposedly esthetic components, and the Cooler Master ML240L in white caught my eye. It was cheaper than other white AIOs, and I had used the brand's air coolers in the past, so I pulled the trigger. From day one, however, the AIO never managed to deliver the performance I expected from a liquid cooler.</p>    <p>Even the idle temps of my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/you-still-dont-need-8-core-cpu-for-gaming/" target="_blank">8-core CPU</a> always stayed around 55–60℃, something you don't expect to see with a liquid cooler. The ML240L might not be the best option on the market, but this kind of performance was dismal, to say the least. My CPU never throttled during gaming, but I soon started wondering what the point was in picking an AIO over an air cooler. I could have saved half the money and spent it on another component —buying more storage, or a slightly better motherboard or case comes to mind.</p>    <h2>
Discoloration is inevitable on white components

<p>It remains a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/wish-i-had-never-built-white-themed-pc/" target="_blank">sad reality of white-themed PCs</a> — a few months or years of use will inevitably lead to an off-white or yellowish look. I had never used white components in the past, but I had some experience with white phone cases to warn me about this phenomenon. High temperatures and UV exposure can accelerate this process, which is what happened to my AIO fans after a year of use. The sides of the fans started looking yellowish instead of white, and no amount of cleaning or pre-emptive maintenance solved the problem.</p>    <p>This discoloration wasn't just limited to my AIO; even my white case started getting yellow in patches. After a few desperate tries to restore it to its original sheen, I gave up and accepted my fate. It was perhaps the price to pay for going after the white esthetic. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-i-would-do-building-new-gaming-pc/" target="_blank">The next time I build a PC</a>, I'll ensure I pick darker (not necessarily all-black) components, crafting a dual-tone look instead of an all-white one. I've had my fill of the all-white esthetic, and wouldn't miss it even in the slightest.</p>    <h2>
Dust sticks out instantly on white fans

</div>
</div>
<p>Another problem with white components of any kind, but especially PC fans, is that dust deposits stick out a lot more than on black hardware. I never used to notice dust caking my components on my previous black-themed PC, but the current one starts looking dirty in a span of weeks. My PC room isn't prone to a lot of dust from the outdoors or pet hair inside the house, but the AIO and case fans still manage to accumulate tons of dust. It's a pain having to meticulously clean each fan blade till it looks somewhat new.</p>    <p>Black-themed components might not look as premium, but they are excellent at camouflaging dust and smudges, at least for much longer than white-themed components. At this point, I've grown lazy and have avoided cleaning my intake vents and fans for months. In fact, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-have-not-cleaned-my-pc-in-three-years/" target="_blank">I haven't deep-cleaned my PC in three years</a>. Still, the dust that has settled on my AIO fans plays spoilsport whenever I need to click pictures of the PC. It seems I'll have to inculcate the habit of regularly cleaning at least the visible surfaces, such as fans, RAM sticks, and the graphics card.</p>    <h3>
Overspending on PC hardware is a rite of passage
</h3>
<p>It might be regrettable, but perhaps each one of us has overspent on PC components at least once. It might have been a fancy AIB GPU, a case with a screen, or a premium motherboard you didn't need. I learned my lesson after wasting money on a subpar AIO cooler only for its looks. My next build will have a quality air cooler and a much different, subtle esthetic. It's time to do something different, after all.</p>]]>

<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-regret-buying-the-ryzen-7-5700x/" target="_blank">I picked the Ryzen 7 5700X</a> for my build, a great processor for gaming and occasional productivity. Being a 65W processor, it didn't need a fancy AIO cooler — a budget air cooler would have been sufficient. However, I was on my quest to buy supposedly esthetic components, and the Cooler Master ML240L in white caught my eye. It was cheaper than other white AIOs, and I had used the brand's air coolers in the past, so I pulled the trigger. From day one, however, the AIO never managed to deliver the performance I expected from a liquid cooler.</p>    <p>Even the idle temps of my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/you-still-dont-need-8-core-cpu-for-gaming/" target="_blank">8-core CPU</a> always stayed around 55–60℃, something you don't expect to see with a liquid cooler. The ML240L might not be the best option on the market, but this kind of performance was dismal, to say the least. My CPU never throttled during gaming, but I soon started wondering what the point was in picking an AIO over an air cooler. I could have saved half the money and spent it on another component —buying more storage, or a slightly better motherboard or case comes to mind.</p>    <h2>
Discoloration is inevitable on white components
</h2><h3>
The law of the land
</h3>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p>It remains a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/wish-i-had-never-built-white-themed-pc/" target="_blank">sad reality of white-themed PCs</a> — a few months or years of use will inevitably lead to an off-white or yellowish look. I had never used white components in the past, but I had some experience with white phone cases to warn me about this phenomenon. High temperatures and UV exposure can accelerate this process, which is what happened to my AIO fans after a year of use. The sides of the fans started looking yellowish instead of white, and no amount of cleaning or pre-emptive maintenance solved the problem.</p>    <p>This discoloration wasn't just limited to my AIO; even my white case started getting yellow in patches. After a few desperate tries to restore it to its original sheen, I gave up and accepted my fate. It was perhaps the price to pay for going after the white esthetic. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-i-would-do-building-new-gaming-pc/" target="_blank">The next time I build a PC</a>, I'll ensure I pick darker (not necessarily all-black) components, crafting a dual-tone look instead of an all-white one. I've had my fill of the all-white esthetic, and wouldn't miss it even in the slightest.</p>    <h2>
Dust sticks out instantly on white fans
</h2><h3>
A tough life for lazy people like me
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="White AIO cooler fans spinning inside a gaming PC" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/aio-liquid-cooler-fans-white-dust-pc.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Another problem with white components of any kind, but especially PC fans, is that dust deposits stick out a lot more than on black hardware. I never used to notice dust caking my components on my previous black-themed PC, but the current one starts looking dirty in a span of weeks. My PC room isn't prone to a lot of dust from the outdoors or pet hair inside the house, but the AIO and case fans still manage to accumulate tons of dust. It's a pain having to meticulously clean each fan blade till it looks somewhat new.</p>    <p>Black-themed components might not look as premium, but they are excellent at camouflaging dust and smudges, at least for much longer than white-themed components. At this point, I've grown lazy and have avoided cleaning my intake vents and fans for months. In fact, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-have-not-cleaned-my-pc-in-three-years/" target="_blank">I haven't deep-cleaned my PC in three years</a>. Still, the dust that has settled on my AIO fans plays spoilsport whenever I need to click pictures of the PC. It seems I'll have to inculcate the habit of regularly cleaning at least the visible surfaces, such as fans, RAM sticks, and the graphics card.</p>    <h3>
Overspending on PC hardware is a rite of passage
</h3>
<p>It might be regrettable, but perhaps each one of us has overspent on PC components at least once. It might have been a fancy AIB GPU, a case with a screen, or a premium motherboard you didn't need. I learned my lesson after wasting money on a subpar AIO cooler only for its looks. My next build will have a quality air cooler and a much different, subtle esthetic. It's time to do something different, after all.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <itunes:author><![CDATA[XDA[RSS+]]]></itunes:author>
    <itunes:summary>
      <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/projects-already-built-with-raspberry-pi-zero-2w/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W may be small</a>, but it has become one of the most dependable pieces of hardware in my home lab. I wanted a lightweight, always-on system to track uptime, latency, and service performance without adding noise or power draw. After months of running Uptime Kuma alongside Grafana and Prometheus, the Pi Zero 2 W has proven itself to be a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/turned-raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-portable-network-scanner-bjorn/" target="_blank">powerful and practical monitoring platform</a>.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>The right software stack provides insight into every corner of the network while consuming minimal power and occupying almost no space.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Even with only four cores and 512MB of RAM, it performs well under constant load. The combination of low power consumption, silent operation, and solid USB-based storage makes it easy to tuck away and forget about. When I check its metrics through Grafana, I’m reminded just how consistently it runs. It is quietly reliable, making it perfect for tasks that require constant attention but no fuss.</p>    <h2>
Why the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W fits the job
</h2><h3>
Compact, quiet, and surprisingly capable
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-560765889" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-560765889" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-560765889" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-560765889" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-560765889-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>At idle, my Zero 2 W draws less than a watt, even while polling multiple endpoints and pushing metrics to Prometheus. When the load increases, such as when Grafana refreshes dashboards or Prometheus writes to disk, CPU utilization remains below 40 percent. That’s impressive for such a small device, especially one that can operate for months without a reboot. It delivers just enough performance for this task without wasting a single bit of energy.</p>    <p>The lack of active cooling never becomes a problem. Even under a sustained workload, the CPU temperature rarely exceeds 55 degrees Celsius when housed in a simple, ventilated case. It sits quietly behind my router, and I never hear or feel it working. The silence and compact form factor make it an ideal choice for a 24-hour network monitoring setup.</p>    <p>Its stability is what truly stands out. My Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W has maintained an uptime of over 99.9 percent for months, only restarting when I choose to update its kernel. It <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-project-startles-everyone/" target="_blank">uses so little power</a> that I can leave it running continuously without concern for heat or cost. Once in place, it simply does its job, day after day, without any intervention.</p>    <h2>
Monitoring tools that make it powerful
</h2><h3>
Uptime Kuma and Grafana + Prometheus in sync
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-753342051" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-753342051" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-753342051" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-753342051" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-753342051-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Uptime Kuma is the first half of the equation, constantly checking whether my local and external services are reachable. It logs every brief interruption and sends alerts when something is offline. Those metrics are then scraped by Prometheus, which organizes the data into a structure that Grafana can visualize. The result is a comprehensive view of network health that updates in real-time.</p>    <p>Even with limited hardware, the combination runs far better than expected. Prometheus is configured with short retention periods and lightweight scrape intervals, maintaining a low load while preserving visibility. Grafana displays these statistics cleanly, and I can track performance trends over days or weeks. Memory usage typically stays around 300 megabytes, leaving headroom for caching and system tasks.</p>    <p>There are limits, of course, but none that matter in daily use. Storing large datasets or long-term logs can strain the Pi’s capacity, but using USB storage helps manage that load. The added endurance of flash drives compared to microSD cards results in fewer write failures and improved reliability. For local monitoring and alerting, those limitations fade into the background, replaced by steady performance and dependable reporting.</p>    <h2>
When limitations become strengths
</h2><h3>
How small constraints make it more efficient
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-1684717287" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-1684717287" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-1684717287" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-1684717287" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-1684717287-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The Zero 2 W’s constraints actually encourage better system management. Its limited memory pushes me to refine Prometheus scraping intervals and be selective about which metrics to keep. That makes every bit of data more intentional, cutting out the noise that often creeps into larger monitoring systems. Working within those limits leads to a more efficient, focused setup overall.</p>    <p>The modest CPU power also shapes <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dust-collecting-devices-that-a-raspberry-pi-can-revive/" target="_blank">how I use it</a>. Instead of collecting every possible data point, I focus on what actually matters: service uptime, latency, and response times. By trimming unnecessary checks, the system stays responsive and accurate. It is better to have a few useful insights than a flood of irrelevant numbers.</p>    <p>Running the Pi from USB storage makes a noticeable difference as well. It eliminates the reliability problems that microSD cards often develop under heavy write activity. The faster storage speeds reduce database lag, and the durability keeps the system stable for months at a time.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>I cannot overstate this point. Micro SD cards are great for initial setup of your Raspberry Pi project, but one with as much read and write activity as a network monitor needs better longevity. An NVMe storage device in a USB adapter would be the most reliable option; it almost seems a waste of the hardware, since the Pi Zero 2 W can’t possibly take full advantage of the increased speed and throughput.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Combined with a steady power supply, even a USB storage device transforms the Pi Zero 2 W into a dependable node that just keeps running.</p>    <h3>
Why the smallest Pi makes the biggest impact
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Raspberry Pi Zero W" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/07/raspberry-pi-zero-w.jpeg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>In a home lab full of powerful devices, the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W continues to impress by doing more with less. It doesn’t need high-end specs or active cooling to deliver consistent, valuable data. The right software stack provides insight into every corner of the network while consuming minimal power and occupying almost no space.</p>    <p>Its limitations aren’t weaknesses, but features that keep it efficient, stable, and predictable. By demanding smarter configuration and maintenance, the Pi fosters better network habits overall. I could run Uptime Kuma and Grafana on a bigger system, but I no longer see a reason to. The smallest Pi proves every day that a little device can have a significant impact.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/projects-already-built-with-raspberry-pi-zero-2w/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W may be small</a>, but it has become one of the most dependable pieces of hardware in my home lab. I wanted a lightweight, always-on system to track uptime, latency, and service performance without adding noise or power draw. After months of running Uptime Kuma alongside Grafana and Prometheus, the Pi Zero 2 W has proven itself to be a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/turned-raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-portable-network-scanner-bjorn/" target="_blank">powerful and practical monitoring platform</a>.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>The right software stack provides insight into every corner of the network while consuming minimal power and occupying almost no space.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Even with only four cores and 512MB of RAM, it performs well under constant load. The combination of low power consumption, silent operation, and solid USB-based storage makes it easy to tuck away and forget about. When I check its metrics through Grafana, I’m reminded just how consistently it runs. It is quietly reliable, making it perfect for tasks that require constant attention but no fuss.</p>    <h2>
Why the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W fits the job
</h2><h3>
Compact, quiet, and surprisingly capable
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-560765889" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-560765889" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-560765889" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-560765889" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-560765889-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>At idle, my Zero 2 W draws less than a watt, even while polling multiple endpoints and pushing metrics to Prometheus. When the load increases, such as when Grafana refreshes dashboards or Prometheus writes to disk, CPU utilization remains below 40 percent. That’s impressive for such a small device, especially one that can operate for months without a reboot. It delivers just enough performance for this task without wasting a single bit of energy.</p>    <p>The lack of active cooling never becomes a problem. Even under a sustained workload, the CPU temperature rarely exceeds 55 degrees Celsius when housed in a simple, ventilated case. It sits quietly behind my router, and I never hear or feel it working. The silence and compact form factor make it an ideal choice for a 24-hour network monitoring setup.</p>    <p>Its stability is what truly stands out. My Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W has maintained an uptime of over 99.9 percent for months, only restarting when I choose to update its kernel. It <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-project-startles-everyone/" target="_blank">uses so little power</a> that I can leave it running continuously without concern for heat or cost. Once in place, it simply does its job, day after day, without any intervention.</p>    <h2>
Monitoring tools that make it powerful
</h2><h3>
Uptime Kuma and Grafana + Prometheus in sync
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-753342051" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-753342051" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-753342051" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-753342051" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-753342051-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Uptime Kuma is the first half of the equation, constantly checking whether my local and external services are reachable. It logs every brief interruption and sends alerts when something is offline. Those metrics are then scraped by Prometheus, which organizes the data into a structure that Grafana can visualize. The result is a comprehensive view of network health that updates in real-time.</p>    <p>Even with limited hardware, the combination runs far better than expected. Prometheus is configured with short retention periods and lightweight scrape intervals, maintaining a low load while preserving visibility. Grafana displays these statistics cleanly, and I can track performance trends over days or weeks. Memory usage typically stays around 300 megabytes, leaving headroom for caching and system tasks.</p>    <p>There are limits, of course, but none that matter in daily use. Storing large datasets or long-term logs can strain the Pi’s capacity, but using USB storage helps manage that load. The added endurance of flash drives compared to microSD cards results in fewer write failures and improved reliability. For local monitoring and alerting, those limitations fade into the background, replaced by steady performance and dependable reporting.</p>    <h2>
When limitations become strengths
</h2><h3>
How small constraints make it more efficient
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-1684717287" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-1684717287" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-1684717287" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-1684717287" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-1684717287-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The Zero 2 W’s constraints actually encourage better system management. Its limited memory pushes me to refine Prometheus scraping intervals and be selective about which metrics to keep. That makes every bit of data more intentional, cutting out the noise that often creeps into larger monitoring systems. Working within those limits leads to a more efficient, focused setup overall.</p>    <p>The modest CPU power also shapes <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dust-collecting-devices-that-a-raspberry-pi-can-revive/" target="_blank">how I use it</a>. Instead of collecting every possible data point, I focus on what actually matters: service uptime, latency, and response times. By trimming unnecessary checks, the system stays responsive and accurate. It is better to have a few useful insights than a flood of irrelevant numbers.</p>    <p>Running the Pi from USB storage makes a noticeable difference as well. It eliminates the reliability problems that microSD cards often develop under heavy write activity. The faster storage speeds reduce database lag, and the durability keeps the system stable for months at a time.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>I cannot overstate this point. Micro SD cards are great for initial setup of your Raspberry Pi project, but one with as much read and write activity as a network monitor needs better longevity. An NVMe storage device in a USB adapter would be the most reliable option; it almost seems a waste of the hardware, since the Pi Zero 2 W can’t possibly take full advantage of the increased speed and throughput.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Combined with a steady power supply, even a USB storage device transforms the Pi Zero 2 W into a dependable node that just keeps running.</p>    <h3>

<p>In a home lab full of powerful devices, the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W continues to impress by doing more with less.

By demanding smarter configuration and maintenance, the Pi fosters better network habits overall. I could run Uptime Kuma and Grafana on a bigger system, but I no longer see a reason to. The smallest Pi proves every day that a little device can have a significant impact.</p>

    <itunes:summary>
      <![CDATA[<p>For years, I kept paying monthly fees for project management and invoicing. I was a long-time Zoho user. Now, I know there are a ton of great, paid subscription tools out there. But I kept hitting annoying limits on how many clients and projects I could have before they made me pay for an upgrade. More than the money, I wanted full control over my own data and tools. I decided I needed to stop renting and start owning my work process.</p>    <p>That’s when I found a free, self-hosted program called TimeTracker. It <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/these-docker-containers-manage-my-freelancing-business/" target="_blank">runs perfectly using Docker</a>, handles all my billing, and has absolutely no client limits or hidden costs. I regretted paying for those big apps the second I got this running.</p>    <h2>
Add as many clients and projects as I want
</h2><h3>
Escape the limits
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-791828888" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-791828888" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-791828888" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-791828888" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-791828888-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the first things that sold me on TimeTracker was how it completely removes the headache of client and project limits. With subscription-based apps, there’s always a struggle. You feel that squeeze of limited clients and projects, and the more you pay, the more you get. That’s just not how I want my project management app to be.</p>    <p>TimeTracker is a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/self-hosted-apps-turned-my-home-moving-breeze/" target="_blank">totally self-hosted app</a>. It lets me add as many clients and projects as I need right out of the box. My workload is always changing, and I can now easily onboard a new, short-term client without having to worry about deleting an old one just to stay under a "free tier" limit.</p>    <p>Organizing my work is super straightforward, too: I just create the client profile, then add all related projects under their name. This means my entire work history, from my biggest long-term contract to a tiny one-off gig, is centrally and freely managed. There are no hidden costs, no annoying "upgrade now" pop-ups, just pure, scalable project management that actually makes my life easier.</p>    <h2>
Simplified task creation and management
</h2><h3>
All task details on one central dashboard
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-2105293491" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-2105293491" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-2105293491" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-2105293491" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-2105293491-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>TimeTracker really helps me manage my tasks faster and smarter. Making a new task is very simple. Just like any other project management software, I can easily add all the necessary details when creating tasks for the client and project. I can set the task name, add a full description, give it a priority level, set a due date, and even assign it to myself or another team member.</p>    <p>What I love is how easy it is to manage everything from one main screen. All my tasks are right there, organized under their projects. I can see what's active and what's next. I can easily update any of those details right from the centralized dashboard, too. It offers a Kanban board view to manage tasks more effectively. TimeTracker just focuses on making things quick and simple, so I can spend my time on my real work, not on figuring out the app.</p>    <h2>
Time tracking and invoice management
</h2><h3>
Integrated time tracking and billing
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-965879301" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-965879301" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-965879301" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-965879301" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-965879301-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The core of TimeTracker is logging time, and the process is perfectly smooth. It’s excellent at tracking task time right alongside my task management. I can track my hours in two simple ways: I can start and stop a timer as I work on a task, or, if I forget to hit "start," I can easily add the time entry manually later. All my hours are logged and linked to the client and project instantly, without messy spreadsheets.</p>    <p>The huge bonus here is invoicing. I simply don't need a separate app anymore! TimeTracker lets me create professional PDF invoices directly from the time I’ve tracked. I just select a date range, and it instantly figures out all my billable hours and rates. This combined time-tracking and billing system is so efficient. It completely cuts out the extra cost, the extra software, and the annoying extra step I always had to take before.</p>    <h2>
A multi-user tool with pretty good analytics features
</h2><h3>
Analytics and growth
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-4-1820487930" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-4-1820487930" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-4-1820487930" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-4-1820487930" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-4-1820487930-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Even though I’m a solo freelancer, I appreciate that TimeTracker is built to grow with me. Being self-hosted, it’s ready to be a multi-user tool, which means I can easily add other team members or contractors if my business expands. This makes it a great, free platform for a small agency, allowing everyone to log their time in one central place.</p>    <p>But what I use the most is analytics. The dashboard gives me an at-a-glance view of my work. I can quickly see my most active clients and my total hours for the current week or month.

<p>TimeTracker is pretty simple to set up. I installed it using Docker, and the process was straightforward and quick. You don't need to be a coding whiz to get this tool running.</p>    <p>Once it was up and running, the real unique point was the clean, responsive design. This is a huge deal for me because I often work from different devices. Whether I’m quickly checking a timer on my phone, logging a quick entry on my tablet, or using my desktop, the screen looks great and adjusts perfectly. It’s reliable on every device, so I’m never stuck waiting to get back to my main computer to handle my projects. That ability to work smoothly on any screen is a great plus point for my workflow.</p>    <h3>
It’s worth trying this early-stage solution
</h3>
<p>TimeTracker is still a new app, and it does have a few key pieces missing. I prefer using <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/self-hosted-services-that-have-fantastic-mobile-apps/" target="_blank">self-hosted platforms with dedicated mobile apps</a>, but there’s no dedicated mobile app here. You have to use your phone's web browser. Also, it currently lacks built-in integrations for tools like Slack or Google Calendar. But for me, a freelancer and a tech blogger, it works perfectly. It does all the main jobs I need: no limits on clients, easy time tracking, and instant invoicing. If you work for yourself or have a small team, this <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-open-source-kanban-app-takes-project-management-next-level/" target="_blank">self-hosted project management app is more than good enough</a> to replace your expensive tools right now. The few things it doesn't have are worth it for the amazing freedom and the no-cost option.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>For years, I kept paying monthly fees for project management and invoicing. I was a long-time Zoho user. Now, I know there are a ton of great, paid subscription tools out there. But I kept hitting annoying limits on how many clients and projects I could have before they made me pay for an upgrade. More than the money, I wanted full control over my own data and tools. I decided I needed to stop renting and start owning my work process.</p>    <p>That’s when I found a free, self-hosted program called TimeTracker. It <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/these-docker-containers-manage-my-freelancing-business/" target="_blank">runs perfectly using Docker</a>, handles all my billing, and has absolutely no client limits or hidden costs. I regretted paying for those big apps the second I got this running.</p>    <h2>
Add as many clients and projects as I want
</h2><h3>
Escape the limits
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-791828888" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-791828888" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-791828888" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-791828888" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-791828888-img" data-gallery-type="">

</div>
<p>One of the first things that sold me on TimeTracker was how it completely removes the headache of client and project limits. With subscription-based apps, there’s always a struggle. You feel that squeeze of limited clients and projects, and the more you pay, the more you get. That’s just not how I want my project management app to be.</p>    <p>TimeTracker is a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/self-hosted-apps-turned-my-home-moving-breeze/" target="_blank">totally self-hosted app</a>. It lets me add as many clients and projects as I need right out of the box. My workload is always changing, and I can now easily onboard a new, short-term client without having to worry about deleting an old one just to stay under a "free tier" limit.</p>    <p>Organizing my work is super straightforward, too: I just create the client profile, then add all related projects under their name. This means my entire work history, from my biggest long-term contract to a tiny one-off gig, is centrally and freely managed. There are no hidden costs, no annoying "upgrade now" pop-ups, just pure, scalable project management that actually makes my life easier.</p>    <h2>

<p>TimeTracker really helps me manage my tasks faster and smarter. Making a new task is very simple. Just like any other project management software, I can easily add all the necessary details when creating tasks for the client and project. I can set the task name, add a full description, give it a priority level, set a due date, and even assign it to myself or another team member.</p>    <p>What I love is how easy it is to manage everything from one main screen. All my tasks are right there, organized under their projects. I can see what's active and what's next. I can easily update any of those details right from the centralized dashboard, too. It offers a Kanban board view to manage tasks more effectively. TimeTracker just focuses on making things quick and simple, so I can spend my time on my real work, not on figuring out the app.</p>    <h2>

</div>
</div>
<p>The core of TimeTracker is logging time, and the process is perfectly smooth. It’s excellent at tracking task time right alongside my task management. I can track my hours in two simple ways: I can start and stop a timer as I work on a task, or, if I forget to hit "start," I can easily add the time entry manually later. All my hours are logged and linked to the client and project instantly, without messy spreadsheets.</p>    <p>The huge bonus here is invoicing. I simply don't need a separate app anymore! TimeTracker lets me create professional PDF invoices directly from the time I’ve tracked. I just select a date range, and it instantly figures out all my billable hours and rates. This combined time-tracking and billing system is so efficient. It completely cuts out the extra cost, the extra software, and the annoying extra step I always had to take before.</p>    <h2>

</div>
</div>
<p>Even though I’m a solo freelancer, I appreciate that TimeTracker is built to grow with me. Being self-hosted, it’s ready to be a multi-user tool, which means I can easily add other team members or contractors if my business expands. This makes it a great, free platform for a small agency, allowing everyone to log their time in one central place.</p>    <p>But what I use the most is analytics. The dashboard gives me an at-a-glance view of my work. I can quickly see my most active clients and my total hours for the current week or month. For a deeper look, I can pull detailed reports that let me filter time logs by project or date. This simple reporting is fantastic for seeing exactly where my time is going, helping me quote jobs better, and ensuring I never miss billing for an hour of work.</p>    <h2>

    <itunes:title><![CDATA[One of my favorite puzzle games ever with 98% positive reviews is 40% off on Steam, so now you have no excuse]]></itunes:title>

      <![CDATA[<p>If you were dumped in a world where people spoke an entirely different language and held unique customs from those on Earth, how confident are you that you'd be able to decipher what everyone is saying via context clues? If that sounds like something you'd love the opportunity to do, then Chants of Sennaar is the game for you. I picked it up in a sale a while ago, and I had a blast completing all of the content and getting the best ending. Now I'm gently sliding it across the table to you, as the game is now 40% off on Steam and, in my opinion, well worth it.</p>    <h2>
Chants of Sennaar is just $12 on Steam right now
</h2>
<p>Chants of Sennaar starts with you waking up in a foreign world. Nobody speaks your language, and every time they say something, their words appear as glyphs in a speech bubble. It's up to you to decipher what those glyphs mean by the context of what the person is doing or gesturing toward. Once you have a solid guess as to what they mean, you can type in what you think the word means, and the game will automatically add it into the NPC's speech so you can give your logic a test-drive.</p>    <p>Fortunately, the game does have a Curse of the Obra-Dinn-esque 'lock-in' mechanic to prevent you from going too far astray. Your character has a book, and within that book are drawings of actions and concepts beside a selection of the glyphs that the people speak. If you think you know what goes where, you can match the glyph to the illustration; get a page spread 100% complete, and the game will lock it in, so you can be sure those words are correct. The ultimate goal is to learn every word of the people around you, but who says that's the <em>only</em> civilization with its own language in the tower?</p>    <p>Here's how the devs describe it:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>Inspired by the myth of Babel, discover an enigmatic and vast tower. As the Traveler, delve into a world full of mysteries, where Peoples have grown distant, unable to communicate with each other anymore. Begin your adventure in a prodigious tower inhabited by five distinct Peoples, observe, listen, and strive to mend the bonds of distrust.</p>
<p>With a smart gameplay system, explore and solve various puzzles to uncover the mysteries of five different interconnected languages. Always guided by your trusty notebook, note each symbol, keep track of your surroundings, engage in conversations with people and unravel the meaning of every glyph. Each step will pave your way to the top of the Tower as each word will restore the link between People.</p>
</blockquote><p>If you're interested in giving it a try, it's currently available for $12 on Steam at a 40% discount until October 25th. Given that it has 98% positive reviews, it's clear that other people love it just as much as I do. Just hit the "where to play" button below and select Steam to head to the store page. And if that doesn't satiate your hunger for brain-busters, check out these <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-puzzle-games-steam/" target="_blank">other puzzle games on Steam</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>If you were dumped in a world where people spoke an entirely different language and held unique customs from those on Earth, how confident are you that you'd be able to decipher what everyone is saying via context clues? If that sounds like something you'd love the opportunity to do, then Chants of Sennaar is the game for you. I picked it up in a sale a while ago, and I had a blast completing all of the content and getting the best ending. Now I'm gently sliding it across the table to you, as the game is now 40% off on Steam and, in my opinion, well worth it.</p>    <h2>
Chants of Sennaar is just $12 on Steam right now
</h2>
<p>Chants of Sennaar starts with you waking up in a foreign world. Nobody speaks your language, and every time they say something, their words appear as glyphs in a speech bubble. It's up to you to decipher what those glyphs mean by the context of what the person is doing or gesturing toward. Once you have a solid guess as to what they mean, you can type in what you think the word means, and the game will automatically add it into the NPC's speech so you can give your logic a test-drive.</p>    <p>Fortunately, the game does have a Curse of the Obra-Dinn-esque 'lock-in' mechanic to prevent you from going too far astray. Your character has a book, and within that book are drawings of actions and concepts beside a selection of the glyphs that the people speak. If you think you know what goes where, you can match the glyph to the illustration; get a page spread 100% complete, and the game will lock it in, so you can be sure those words are correct. The ultimate goal is to learn every word of the people around you, but who says that's the <em>only</em> civilization with its own language in the tower?</p>    <p>Here's how the devs describe it:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>Inspired by the myth of Babel, discover an enigmatic and vast tower. As the Traveler, delve into a world full of mysteries, where Peoples have grown distant, unable to communicate with each other anymore. Begin your adventure in a prodigious tower inhabited by five distinct Peoples, observe, listen, and strive to mend the bonds of distrust.</p>
<p>With a smart gameplay system, explore and solve various puzzles to uncover the mysteries of five different interconnected languages. Always guided by your trusty notebook, note each symbol, keep track of your surroundings, engage in conversations with people and unravel the meaning of every glyph. Each step will pave your way to the top of the Tower as each word will restore the link between People.</p>
</blockquote><p>If you're interested in giving it a try, it's currently available for $12 on Steam at a 40% discount until October 25th. Given that it has 98% positive reviews, it's clear that other people love it just as much as I do. Just hit the "where to play" button below and select Steam to head to the store page. And if that doesn't satiate your hunger for brain-busters, check out these <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-puzzle-games-steam/" target="_blank">other puzzle games on Steam</a>.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you were dumped in a world where people spoke an entirely different language and held unique customs from those on Earth, how confident are you that you'd be able to decipher what everyone is saying via context clues? If that sounds like something you'd love the opportunity to do, then Chants of Sennaar is the game for you. I picked it up in a sale a while ago, and I had a blast completing all of the content and getting the best ending. Now I'm gently sliding it across the table to you, as the game is now 40% off on Steam and, in my opinion, well worth it.</p>    <h2>
Chants of Sennaar is just $12 on Steam right now
</h2>
<p>Chants of Sennaar starts with you waking up in a foreign world. Nobody speaks your language, and every time they say something, their words appear as glyphs in a speech bubble. It's up to you to decipher what those glyphs mean by the context of what the person is doing or gesturing toward. Once you have a solid guess as to what they mean, you can type in what you think the word means, and the game will automatically add it into the NPC's speech so you can give your logic a test-drive.</p>    <p>Fortunately, the game does have a Curse of the Obra-Dinn-esque 'lock-in' mechanic to prevent you from going too far astray. Your character has a book, and within that book are drawings of actions and concepts beside a selection of the glyphs that the people speak. If you think you know what goes where, you can match the glyph to the illustration; get a page spread 100% complete, and the game will lock it in, so you can be sure those words are correct. The ultimate goal is to learn every word of the people around you, but who says that's the <em>only</em> civilization with its own language in the tower?</p>    <p>Here's how the devs describe it:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>Inspired by the myth of Babel, discover an enigmatic and vast tower. As the Traveler, delve into a world full of mysteries, where Peoples have grown distant, unable to communicate with each other anymore. Begin your adventure in a prodigious tower inhabited by five distinct Peoples, observe, listen, and strive to mend the bonds of distrust.</p>
<p>With a smart gameplay system, explore and solve various puzzles to uncover the mysteries of five different interconnected languages. Always guided by your trusty notebook, note each symbol, keep track of your surroundings, engage in conversations with people and unravel the meaning of every glyph. Each step will pave your way to the top of the Tower as each word will restore the link between People.</p>
</blockquote><p>If you're interested in giving it a try, it's currently available for $12 on Steam at a 40% discount until October 25th. Given that it has 98% positive reviews, it's clear that other people love it just as much as I do. Just hit the "where to play" button below and select Steam to head to the store page. And if that doesn't satiate your hunger for brain-busters, check out these <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-puzzle-games-steam/" target="_blank">other puzzle games on Steam</a>.</p>
