      <![CDATA[<p>It's been a while since <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/apple-vision-pro-headset/" target="_blank">Apple introduced the Vision Pro</a> VR headset, but today, it's finally getting upgraded for the first time. The first-generation model is about one and a half years old, which may not seem like much, but Apple has made big strides with its chips in a short period, so it was starting to feel a little long in the tooth.</p>    <p>Today, along with announcing the Apple M5 chipset, the company also announced that the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-vision-pro-upgraded-with-the-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band/" target="_blank">Vision Pro will now feature that very same chip</a> — a big leap from the Apple M2 that was found in the original model. But that's not the end of the upgrades.</p>    <h2>
The Apple M5 is a big jump
</h2><h3>
Leveling up across the board

</div>
<p>Coming off the Apple M2, the Vision Pro is getting a massive upgrade by jumping straight to the new M5 chip. Apple claims this new processor has a 15% faster CPU than the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tested-apple-m4-vs-intel-lunar-lake-snapdragon-x-elite/" target="_blank">Apple M4</a>, 45% graphics performance, and nearly four times the GPU compute power for AI. But that's compared to the M4, and while Apple didn't provide a ton of specific comparisons to the much older M2, those differences are going to be even more significant.</p>    <p>Oddly enough, the only comparison Apple does make in its announcement has to do with the Neural Engine. The new 16-core Neural Engine in the Apple M5 promises AI features will run up to 50% faster for system experiences, or up to two times faster for third-party apps.</p>    <p>While the main processor gets a big upgrade, the Apple R1 — the chip responsible for processing data from the various cameras and sensors — hasn't been upgraded for this model. Presumably, that should be fine, since the sensors also haven't changed.</p>    <h2>
The display is even sharper

And smoother, too

</div>
</div>
<p>Another upgrade Apple did make has to do with the display. Leveraging the additional power of the Apple M5, the new Vision Pro can now render 10% more pixels on its micro-OLED displays. Interestingly, the spec sheet still mentions 23 million pixels, the same as what was shown on the spec sheet for the previous model.</p>    <p>What's more, the refresh rate of the screens now goes up to 120Hz, offering a smoother experience. A poor framerate tends to be one of the bigger causes of motion sickness induced by VR, so this should help address that if you found that the 100Hz panels in the previous generation weren't good enough.</p>    <h2>
You can actually wear it now

<small>Render credit: Apple</small>
</div>
</div>
<p>The last major upgrade for the new Vision Pro comes in the form of a completely new band for holding the device on your head. The original model featured a single band that went around your head, but when you consider the weight of the headset and how all of it is on the front, it made it pretty unwieldy.</p>    <p>With the upgraded Vision Pro, Apple has also introduced the Dual Knit Band, which now goes not only around the side of your head, but also offers additional support on top of your head, making it that much harder for the headset to move out of place or become uncomfortable.</p>    <p>Of course, you can also buy the Dual Knit Band separately to upgrade your existing Vision Pro if you don't spend $3,500 all over again.</p>    <h2>
It's shipping next week
</h2><p>The Apple Vision Pro with the M5 chip is available to pre-order starting today, and it costs the same $3,500 that the original model did, making it decidedly an ethtusiast product. If you do decide to buy one for yourself, though, it will begin shipping next Wednesday, October 22. That's also when you'll find it in stores.</p>

</section><p>Apple fans woke up today with a huge wave of news to check out. The company revealed more information about its new Vision Pro and its iPad, but it wasn't done there. Among the news was details on a brand new MacBook Pro, and while the device itself is looking pretty sleek, what I'm interested in is what's powering it: the mighty new M5 chip.</p>    <h2>
Apple pulls back the curtain on the M5
</h2>

</div>
<p>Before we tuck into the MacBook Pro news, let's take a look at that new <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unleashes-m5-the-next-big-leap-in-ai-performance-for-apple-silicon/" target="_blank">M5 chip</a>. Apple states that it's a 10-core GPU with a graphics performance that's "up to 45 percent higher than M4" and "nearly 30 percent increase in unified memory bandwidth," up to 153GB/s.</p>    <p>However, one recurring theme we see in this press release is AI. In fact, every header except the environmental impact statement is somehow tied to AI. And once you dig into the guts of the M5, you begin to see why. As Apple explains:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>With the next-generation GPU architecture in M5, every compute block of the chip is optimized for AI. The 10-core GPU features a dedicated Neural Accelerator in each core, delivering over 4x peak GPU compute compared to M4, and over 6x peak GPU compute for AI performance compared to M1.1 And now with M5, the new 14-inch MacBook Pro and iPad Pro benefit from dramatically accelerated processing for AI-driven workflows, such as running diffusion models in apps like Draw Things, or running large language models locally using platforms like webAI.</p>
</blockquote><p>Apple claims that this chip not only chews through AI processes like nothing before it, but it also does so with greater power efficiency. That means you can try out features like Apple Intelligence with quicker processing times, and it's a huge focus for the Cupertino giant right now.</p>    <h2>
Apple also unveils the new MacBook Pro with an M5 chip

In fact, every header except the environmental impact statement is somehow tied to AI. And once you dig into the guts of the M5, you begin to see why. As Apple explains:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>With the next-generation GPU architecture in M5, every compute block of the chip is optimized for AI. The 10-core GPU features a dedicated Neural Accelerator in each core, delivering over 4x peak GPU compute compared to M4, and over 6x peak GPU compute for AI performance compared to M1.1 And now with M5, the new 14-inch MacBook Pro and iPad Pro benefit from dramatically accelerated processing for AI-driven workflows, such as running diffusion models in apps like Draw Things, or running large language models locally using platforms like webAI.</p>
</blockquote><p>Apple claims that this chip not only chews through AI processes like nothing before it, but it also does so with greater power efficiency. That means you can try out features like Apple Intelligence with quicker processing times, and it's a huge focus for the Cupertino giant right now.</p>    <h2>

    <itunes:summary>
      <![CDATA[<p>There’s a lot to like about Adobe. The apps are powerful, integrated, capable of handling almost any creative workflow, and it’s the industry standard. But somewhere along the line, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dropping-adobe-made-me-rethink-creative-workflow/" target="_blank">Adobe became more and more unlikable</a>. Not only are the subscriptions expensive, the majority of the software is completely subscription-locked without any free tiers. Adobe Express is perhaps the only decent free option there is, in my opinion. There’s also the issue of bloated software with features many of us never use, and concern over data privacy, especially regarding training the Adobe AI models.</p>    <p>I’ve <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-saying-goodbye-adobe/" target="_blank">left the world of Adobe</a> a while ago now, and have successfully replaced many of its software with free and open-source alternatives. Open-source apps are truly catching up with their modern-day proprietary counterparts, and they offer more benefits, such as being open, more secure, comprehensive free versions, and some even have unique features that outperform Adobe’s offerings. These are the best open-source <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/should-have-left-adobe-for-open-source-graphics-stack-sooner/" target="_blank">Adobe graphics alternatives</a> I’ve used to date…</p>    <h2>
GIMP
</h2><h3>
The best open-source image and graphics editor there is
</h3>

<p>GIMP has been around for decades, and it has aged really well. It’s still one of the few open-source graphics apps that can <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-gimp-does-better-than-photoshop/" target="_blank">stand toe-to-toe with Photoshop</a>. While I’m not a fan of the interface, its feature set and functionality more than makes up for it. You can customize the layout far more than Photoshop anyway, so I’ll take that as a win for the UI.</p>    <p>GIMP covers everything most photographers and designers need. It has advanced layer and mask management, and a full suite of selection tools – everything from freehand lasso to intelligent foreground select. Combine that with the healing and clone tools, blend modes, brushes, filters, and layering system, and it already covers much of what I used to use Photoshop for. The standout feature is the plugin and script support. The GMIC plugin is probably the most comprehensive suite of features I’ve ever used in an app, from advanced color adjustments to 3D effects.</p>    <p>GIMP handles high-res files and supports multiple color spaces like RGB, CMYK, and even LAB. Plus it supports a wide range of formats. Overall, if you’re looking for a professional image and graphics editor, you can’t go wrong with GIMP. The only downside is that it doesn’t support smart objects or adjustment layers. If you’re looking for something a little more creative and modern than GIMP, I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://krita.org/en/" target="_blank">Krita</a>.</p>

Inkscape

A vector powerhouse that rivals Illustrator

</div>
<p>I’ve tried my fair share of open-source vector editors, but I always <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/not-using-illustrator-anymore-use-this-instead/" target="_blank">keep coming back to Inkscape</a>. It is <em>the</em> Illustrator alternative. It’s a full-featured SVG editor that has you covered with anything from logos and icons to complex illustrations. At its core, it gives you precise path editing, node manipulations, and boolean operations, making it easy to create shapes and refine every curve exactly how you want.</p>    <p>The object management system is robust. You can layer, group, hide, and lock objects. And the snapping tools and guides make alignment painless. Inkscape also has advanced typography support, including text on paths and multi-line editing, which makes it viable for anything from branding to web graphics. It also supports extensions and plugins, letting you automate repetitive tasks and add extra effects. And, like GIMP, the interface is highly customizable. Overall, this is the go-to tool for anyone who’s serious about vector work but tired of subscriptions.</p>

<p>Adobe XD was the go-to for interface design, but it’s no longer available as a standalone app and is locked behind the All Apps subscription – it also doesn’t get updates anymore. Penpot, on the other hand, is a free, open-source, browser-based, self-hostable UI/UX design app, and it is actively maintained and getting updates. This is one of the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/regret-not-ditching-adobe-for-open-source-design-app/" target="_blank">best modern alternatives for product design</a>.</p>    <p>It offers vector-based design tools such as frames, shapes, drawing, components, and so on, with adjustable properties for all of them, such as color, size, position, etc. If you’ve ever used Figma, you’ll feel right at home in Penpot since they’re mirrors of each other. There’s also an auto-layout function, prototyping, tokens, and dev hand-off. And the app is very collaborative by nature, making it ideal for team projects. I can’t rave enough about Penpot – it’s a must-try for anyone who wants a free option for UI design.</p>

Darktable
</h2><h3>
A free and capable RAW image editor
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-4-966282346" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-4-966282346" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-4-966282346" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-4-966282346" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-4-966282346-img" data-gallery-type="">

</div>
<p>I don’t shoot RAW that much, so Darktable isn’t my most frequent reach, but I had to include it in this list as an alternative to Lightroom. It’s a non-destructive RAW editor that handles everything from exposure adjustments and color grading to lens correction. All your edits get stored as metadata so the original files remain untouched – exactly what a professional workflow should look like.</p>    <p>The app uses a module-based system as opposed to Lightroom’s panel-based system. There are modules for tone curves, color balance, denoising, shadows/highlights, and even wavelet-based editing. Darktable also shines with batch workflows; you can apply the same edits to multiple images at a time. Beyond RAW, it also handles standard formats like JPEG and PNG, so it integrates perfectly into any editing workflow.</p>

Adobe is falling behind

<p>Open-source graphics tools have come a long way, and the options on this list prove you don’t need Adobe to work like a pro.

While I’m not a fan of the interface, its feature set and functionality more than makes up for it. You can customize the layout far more than Photoshop anyway, so I’ll take that as a win for the UI.</p>    <p>GIMP covers everything most photographers and designers need. It has advanced layer and mask management, and a full suite of selection tools – everything from freehand lasso to intelligent foreground select. Combine that with the healing and clone tools, blend modes, brushes, filters, and layering system, and it already covers much of what I used to use Photoshop for. The standout feature is the plugin and script support. The GMIC plugin is probably the most comprehensive suite of features I’ve ever used in an app, from advanced color adjustments to 3D effects.</p>    <p>GIMP handles high-res files and supports multiple color spaces like RGB, CMYK, and even LAB. Plus it supports a wide range of formats. Overall, if you’re looking for a professional image and graphics editor, you can’t go wrong with GIMP. The only downside is that it doesn’t support smart objects or adjustment layers.

<p>I don’t shoot RAW that much, so Darktable isn’t my most frequent reach, but I had to include it in this list as an alternative to Lightroom. It’s a non-destructive RAW editor that handles everything from exposure adjustments and color grading to lens correction. All your edits get stored as metadata so the original files remain untouched – exactly what a professional workflow should look like.</p>    <p>The app uses a module-based system as opposed to Lightroom’s panel-based system. There are modules for tone curves, color balance, denoising, shadows/highlights, and even wavelet-based editing. Darktable also shines with batch workflows; you can apply the same edits to multiple images at a time. Beyond RAW, it also handles standard formats like JPEG and PNG, so it integrates perfectly into any editing workflow.</p>

<p>I don’t shoot RAW that much, so Darktable isn’t my most frequent reach, but I had to include it in this list as an alternative to Lightroom. It’s a non-destructive RAW editor that handles everything from exposure adjustments and color grading to lens correction. All your edits get stored as metadata so the original files remain untouched – exactly what a professional workflow should look like.</p>    <p>The app uses a module-based system as opposed to Lightroom’s panel-based system. There are modules for tone curves, color balance, denoising, shadows/highlights, and even wavelet-based editing. Darktable also shines with batch workflows; you can apply the same edits to multiple images at a time. Beyond RAW, it also handles standard formats like JPEG and PNG, so it integrates perfectly into any editing workflow.</p>

Adobe is falling behind
</h3>
<p>Open-source graphics tools have come a long way, and the options on this list prove you don’t need Adobe to work like a pro. GIMP handles image and graphics editing with precision, Inkscape covers everything you need in vector design, Penpot keeps UI design smooth (and up to date!), and Darktable takes care of your RAW processing. And for free.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is supposed to be the Windows version of Valve's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/steam-deck-review/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. It even features the AMD Ryzen Z2 A APU, which is near identical to the Steam Deck's custom Van Gogh processor. Microsoft also slimmed down Windows 11 for the Xbox Fullscreen Experience, available on both the Xbox Ally and its more powerful sibling, so the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X suffer less performance loss from all that extra Windows functionality.</p>    <p>Combined with a 7-inch, 1080p IPS display and ergonomic handgrips based on the beloved Xbox controller, the Xbox Ally is a joy to game on. In fact, with its similar APU, improved ergonomics, and streamlined Windows experience, the ROG Xbox Ally comes closer to matching the Steam Deck than any previous Windows handheld. However, it still falls just short of the OG handheld gaming PC for a few key reasons.</p>

<h2>
Asus ROG Xbox Ally pricing and availability
</h2><h3>
What does the entry-level Xbox handheld actually get you?
</h3>
<p>Because the ROG Xbox Ally is the entry-level Xbox handheld, it may seem a bit underpowered in terms of raw specs. The Xbox Ally is powered by the Ryzen Z2 A APU and features 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, a 512GB NvME M2 SSD, and a 7-inch, 1920x1080, 120Hz IPS display. In keeping with its status as the entry-level handheld, the Xbox Ally costs $599 and is available through Asus directly, or at popular retailers like Best Buy and Walmart.</p>    <p>While Microsoft and Asus picked a relatively low price point for the Xbox Ally, it's worth noting that the Steam Deck costs significantly less for its base 256GB model ($399), and even the 512GB OLED upgrade is still cheaper than the Xbox handheld at $549. Sure, the Xbox Ally has a higher screen resolution, but the it's still optimized for 720p performance. And at that point, the Steam Deck OLED gets you both a better bargain and a better display.</p>

<h2>
The Xbox Ally redesign
</h2><h3>
The Xbox hand grips may look dorky, but they're a genius design
</h3>

<p>When redesigning the Asus ROG Ally for the Xbox collaboration, Asus mimicked the classic Xbox controller grips for the handheld gaming PC. While this looks strange from a design perspective, the functionality of those ergonomic grips is more than worth the slightly dorky design.</p>    <p>I often complain about the weight of handheld gaming PCs being too much for extended game sessions, or how the grips are too flat or sharp to be fully ergonomic. Having your fingertips fall asleep while holding up the original Asus ROG Ally or MSI Claw 7 is a pretty common experience, and it's one you get to avoid with the Xbox Ally. Unlike the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lenovo-legion-go-2-review/" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go 2</a>, the Xbox Ally's hand grips have significantly better weight distribution, and the Xbox Ally is just under 1.4 pounds total, so using it for a few hours is beyond easy. I don't think any other handheld on the market currently feels as comfortable as the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X.</p>    <p>The Xbox Ally also has the classic Xbox controller buttons, complete with the coordinating colors for the A, B, X, and Y buttons. While it still looks recognizable as an Asus ROG product, the Xbox Ally also looks like it fits right in next to an Xbox Series S console. And when you think about it, the Xbox Ally is very much the Series S to the Xbox Ally X's Series X.</p>    <h2>
New Windows 11, same old problems
</h2><h3>
The Xbox Full Screen Experience makes a lot of promises
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Playing Persona 4 Golden on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/asus-rog-xbox-ally-p4.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">

</div>
<p> As one of two devices to pioneer the reworked version of Windows 11 in the Xbox Full Screen Experience, the Xbox Ally has the potential to benefit from the streamlined Xbox experience, assuming you only play games through the Xbox app.</p>    <p>While you can go back to the Xbox Fullscreen Experience from the desktop, you'll still have to contend with that extra Windows 11 overhead. So you need to reboot the system to get the full performance benefits of the streamlined OS. And even then, if your game is from a third-party launcher, it will probably require booting the game from the full Windows desktop, once again voiding the benefits of the streamlined operating system.</p>    <p>The only surefire way to get the full benefit of the Xbox Fullscreen Experience is to only play Xbox or Game Pass titles. If you're a big Xbox fan or new to the PC gaming world, that's not so much of a drawback. But if most of your games are owned through a third-party storefront like Steam, Epic Games Store, or GOG, then it's not worth getting either Xbox handheld for the benefits of the trimmed-down UI, since you'll almost never get to benefit.</p>    <p>Microsoft and Asus will be pushing updates to the Xbox Fullscreen Experience, so it's possible this could get better over time. While Microsoft has not announced that the Xbox Fullscreen Experience will be hitting other handheld gaming PCs, there are some other handheld optimizations made to the base Windows 11 operating system that I could easily see getting pushed to other Windows handheld gaming PCs. The one I found the most useful was the updated Windows 11 on-screen keyboard, which now functions with the built-in handheld buttons, operating like the on-screen keyboard in the existing Xbox OS. So you've got the same controller shortcuts like pressing down the left thumbstick for caps and hitting LT for a keyboard of numbers and symbols. It's a small change, but considering how often you have to log in to various storefronts and launchers when gaming on PC, it's an absolute time saver.</p>    <h2>
Xbox Ally performance

The Ryzen Z2 A feels like a poor choice for Windows

<p> One of my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amds-fsr-4-could-save-the-asus-xbox-ally/" target="_blank">biggest concerns with the ROG Xbox Ally</a> was its underpowered, 4-core APU design. While the Steam Deck can get away with its 4-core APU by virtue of its low cost and the lower overhead of its custom Linux OS, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally doesn't have quite the same benefit. While the Xbox Ally is cheaper than other Windows-based handhelds, the base Asus ROG Ally is just $50 more expensive and gets you the more powerful Ryzen Z1 APU.</p>    <p>While Microsoft did a lot of work to make the streamlined Xbox Fullscreen Experience, the instant the handheld goes to the Windows 11 desktop, all those performance gains are lost as the full Windows 11 version boots up with all its extra features and background telemetry. So benchmarking the Xbox Ally meant dealing with the full Windows 11 overhead, leaving the Ally looking especially grim in comparison to more powerful Windows handhelds like the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/review-msi-claw-8-ai-plus-a2vm/" target="_blank">MSI Claw 8 AI+</a>, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review/" target="_blank">Asus ROG Ally X</a>, or Lenovo Legion Go 2.</p>    <p>All of my test games are owned through Steam and GOG, so even when benchmarking the Xbox Ally's gaming performance, I had to deal with that extra Windows 11 overhead. Though I restarted the handheld and launched the games from the Xbox Fullscreen Experience, I still had to go through Windows 11 to get them fully booted from Steam or GOG. All three games were benchmarked with the Xbox Ally at its full 24W TDP.</p>    <div>

<p>While utilizing AMD FSR upscaling and frame generation does get you smoother performance, the Xbox Ally's limited APU really does require medium or low settings to run smoothly at 720p, and you lose a lot of performance by upgrading to the handheld's max resolution.</p>    <p>Playing more indie titles, or ones designed for older hardware like <em>Persona 4 Golden</em> left me with a much better experience, so the Xbox Ally is really an indie or retro game machine. So if you plan to play more graphically intense games, opting for the more expensive Xbox Ally X is definitely worth the increased investment.</p>    <p>As far as battery life goes, the Xbox Ally lasted 2 hours and 25 minutes on the PCMark 10 gaming battery test, with the system's brightness set to 50% the handheld set to its 15W unplugged default power profile. I got much less time while running <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, as the Xbox Ally was drained nearly to 0% after just a few daily roulettes, but then again online games do tend to drain far more battery power than offline titles.</p>    <p>You can also get a decent bit more time with the handheld at the Silent (6W) profile, but that's ideal for indie titles like <em>Hades II</em> or <em>Hollow Knight</em> rather than <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>.</p>    <h2>
Should you buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally?
</h2><p><strong>You should buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
You don't own a gaming handheld
</li>
<li>
You're looking for a smooth transition from the Xbox console to a handheld gaming PC
</li>
<li>
Most of your games are purchased through Xbox or GamePass
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should NOT buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
You already own a gaming handheld
</li>
<li>
You want the best handheld gaming bargain
</li>
<li>
Most of your games are owned through non-Xbox storefronts like Steam, Epic Games, GOG, etc
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is a great transition devices for those looking to start dipping their toes into the PC gaming space, since the streamlined Xbox Fullscreen Experience works best with the Xbox and GamePass libraries, rather than outside launchers. It can be a great secondary console to break up arguments between families.</p>    <p>But more serious Xbox gamers and PC enthusiasts will want to save up a bit more for the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X since it's more powerful, and can handle the latest AAA game titles better than its entry-level sibling. Meanwhile, those searching for the best bargain in handheld gaming will find no better deal than the Steam Deck. It has similar or better performance to the Xbox Ally, and is still cheaper even with the OLED display upgrade.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is supposed to be the Windows version of Valve's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/steam-deck-review/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. It even features the AMD Ryzen Z2 A APU, which is near identical to the Steam Deck's custom Van Gogh processor. Microsoft also slimmed down Windows 11 for the Xbox Fullscreen Experience, available on both the Xbox Ally and its more powerful sibling, so the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X suffer less performance loss from all that extra Windows functionality.</p>    <p>Combined with a 7-inch, 1080p IPS display and ergonomic handgrips based on the beloved Xbox controller, the Xbox Ally is a joy to game on. In fact, with its similar APU, improved ergonomics, and streamlined Windows experience, the ROG Xbox Ally comes closer to matching the Steam Deck than any previous Windows handheld. However, it still falls just short of the OG handheld gaming PC for a few key reasons.</p>

<h2>
Asus ROG Xbox Ally pricing and availability
</h2><h3>
What does the entry-level Xbox handheld actually get you?
</h3>
<p>Because the ROG Xbox Ally is the entry-level Xbox handheld, it may seem a bit underpowered in terms of raw specs. The Xbox Ally is powered by the Ryzen Z2 A APU and features 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, a 512GB NvME M2 SSD, and a 7-inch, 1920x1080, 120Hz IPS display. In keeping with its status as the entry-level handheld, the Xbox Ally costs $599 and is available through Asus directly, or at popular retailers like Best Buy and Walmart.</p>    <p>While Microsoft and Asus picked a relatively low price point for the Xbox Ally, it's worth noting that the Steam Deck costs significantly less for its base 256GB model ($399), and even the 512GB OLED upgrade is still cheaper than the Xbox handheld at $549. Sure, the Xbox Ally has a higher screen resolution, but the it's still optimized for 720p performance. And at that point, the Steam Deck OLED gets you both a better bargain and a better display.</p>

<h2>
The Xbox Ally redesign
</h2><h3>
The Xbox hand grips may look dorky, but they're a genius design
</h3>

</div>
<p>When redesigning the Asus ROG Ally for the Xbox collaboration, Asus mimicked the classic Xbox controller grips for the handheld gaming PC. While this looks strange from a design perspective, the functionality of those ergonomic grips is more than worth the slightly dorky design.</p>    <p>I often complain about the weight of handheld gaming PCs being too much for extended game sessions, or how the grips are too flat or sharp to be fully ergonomic. Having your fingertips fall asleep while holding up the original Asus ROG Ally or MSI Claw 7 is a pretty common experience, and it's one you get to avoid with the Xbox Ally. Unlike the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lenovo-legion-go-2-review/" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go 2</a>, the Xbox Ally's hand grips have significantly better weight distribution, and the Xbox Ally is just under 1.4 pounds total, so using it for a few hours is beyond easy. I don't think any other handheld on the market currently feels as comfortable as the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X.</p>    <p>The Xbox Ally also has the classic Xbox controller buttons, complete with the coordinating colors for the A, B, X, and Y buttons. While it still looks recognizable as an Asus ROG product, the Xbox Ally also looks like it fits right in next to an Xbox Series S console. And when you think about it, the Xbox Ally is very much the Series S to the Xbox Ally X's Series X.</p>    <h2>
New Windows 11, same old problems
</h2><h3>
The Xbox Full Screen Experience makes a lot of promises
</h3>
<div>

</div>
<p> As one of two devices to pioneer the reworked version of Windows 11 in the Xbox Full Screen Experience, the Xbox Ally has the potential to benefit from the streamlined Xbox experience, assuming you only play games through the Xbox app.</p>    <p>While you can go back to the Xbox Fullscreen Experience from the desktop, you'll still have to contend with that extra Windows 11 overhead. So you need to reboot the system to get the full performance benefits of the streamlined OS. And even then, if your game is from a third-party launcher, it will probably require booting the game from the full Windows desktop, once again voiding the benefits of the streamlined operating system.</p>    <p>The only surefire way to get the full benefit of the Xbox Fullscreen Experience is to only play Xbox or Game Pass titles. If you're a big Xbox fan or new to the PC gaming world, that's not so much of a drawback. But if most of your games are owned through a third-party storefront like Steam, Epic Games Store, or GOG, then it's not worth getting either Xbox handheld for the benefits of the trimmed-down UI, since you'll almost never get to benefit.</p>    <p>Microsoft and Asus will be pushing updates to the Xbox Fullscreen Experience, so it's possible this could get better over time. While Microsoft has not announced that the Xbox Fullscreen Experience will be hitting other handheld gaming PCs, there are some other handheld optimizations made to the base Windows 11 operating system that I could easily see getting pushed to other Windows handheld gaming PCs. The one I found the most useful was the updated Windows 11 on-screen keyboard, which now functions with the built-in handheld buttons, operating like the on-screen keyboard in the existing Xbox OS. So you've got the same controller shortcuts like pressing down the left thumbstick for caps and hitting LT for a keyboard of numbers and symbols. It's a small change, but considering how often you have to log in to various storefronts and launchers when gaming on PC, it's an absolute time saver.</p>    <h2>
Xbox Ally performance

The Ryzen Z2 A feels like a poor choice for Windows

<p> One of my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amds-fsr-4-could-save-the-asus-xbox-ally/" target="_blank">biggest concerns with the ROG Xbox Ally</a> was its underpowered, 4-core APU design. While the Steam Deck can get away with its 4-core APU by virtue of its low cost and the lower overhead of its custom Linux OS, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally doesn't have quite the same benefit. While the Xbox Ally is cheaper than other Windows-based handhelds, the base Asus ROG Ally is just $50 more expensive and gets you the more powerful Ryzen Z1 APU.</p>    <p>While Microsoft did a lot of work to make the streamlined Xbox Fullscreen Experience, the instant the handheld goes to the Windows 11 desktop, all those performance gains are lost as the full Windows 11 version boots up with all its extra features and background telemetry. So benchmarking the Xbox Ally meant dealing with the full Windows 11 overhead, leaving the Ally looking especially grim in comparison to more powerful Windows handhelds like the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/review-msi-claw-8-ai-plus-a2vm/" target="_blank">MSI Claw 8 AI+</a>, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review/" target="_blank">Asus ROG Ally X</a>, or Lenovo Legion Go 2.</p>    <p>All of my test games are owned through Steam and GOG, so even when benchmarking the Xbox Ally's gaming performance, I had to deal with that extra Windows 11 overhead. Though I restarted the handheld and launched the games from the Xbox Fullscreen Experience, I still had to go through Windows 11 to get them fully booted from Steam or GOG. All three games were benchmarked with the Xbox Ally at its full 24W TDP.</p>    <div>

<p>While utilizing AMD FSR upscaling and frame generation does get you smoother performance, the Xbox Ally's limited APU really does require medium or low settings to run smoothly at 720p, and you lose a lot of performance by upgrading to the handheld's max resolution.</p>    <p>Playing more indie titles, or ones designed for older hardware like <em>Persona 4 Golden</em> left me with a much better experience, so the Xbox Ally is really an indie or retro game machine. So if you plan to play more graphically intense games, opting for the more expensive Xbox Ally X is definitely worth the increased investment.</p>    <p>As far as battery life goes, the Xbox Ally lasted 2 hours and 25 minutes on the PCMark 10 gaming battery test, with the system's brightness set to 50% the handheld set to its 15W unplugged default power profile. I got much less time while running <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, as the Xbox Ally was drained nearly to 0% after just a few daily roulettes, but then again online games do tend to drain far more battery power than offline titles.</p>    <p>You can also get a decent bit more time with the handheld at the Silent (6W) profile, but that's ideal for indie titles like <em>Hades II</em> or <em>Hollow Knight</em> rather than <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>.</p>    <h2>
Should you buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally?
</h2><p><strong>You should buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
You don't own a gaming handheld
</li>
<li>
You're looking for a smooth transition from the Xbox console to a handheld gaming PC
</li>
<li>
Most of your games are purchased through Xbox or GamePass
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should NOT buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
You already own a gaming handheld
</li>
<li>
You want the best handheld gaming bargain
</li>
<li>
Most of your games are owned through non-Xbox storefronts like Steam, Epic Games, GOG, etc
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is a great transition devices for those looking to start dipping their toes into the PC gaming space, since the streamlined Xbox Fullscreen Experience works best with the Xbox and GamePass libraries, rather than outside launchers. It can be a great secondary console to break up arguments between families.</p>    <p>But more serious Xbox gamers and PC enthusiasts will want to save up a bit more for the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X since it's more powerful, and can handle the latest AAA game titles better than its entry-level sibling. Meanwhile, those searching for the best bargain in handheld gaming will find no better deal than the Steam Deck. It has similar or better performance to the Xbox Ally, and is still cheaper even with the OLED display upgrade.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is supposed to be the Windows version of Valve's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/steam-deck-review/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. It even features the AMD Ryzen Z2 A APU, which is near identical to the Steam Deck's custom Van Gogh processor. Microsoft also slimmed down Windows 11 for the Xbox Fullscreen Experience, available on both the Xbox Ally and its more powerful sibling, so the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X suffer less performance loss from all that extra Windows functionality.</p>    <p>Combined with a 7-inch, 1080p IPS display and ergonomic handgrips based on the beloved Xbox controller, the Xbox Ally is a joy to game on. In fact, with its similar APU, improved ergonomics, and streamlined Windows experience, the ROG Xbox Ally comes closer to matching the Steam Deck than any previous Windows handheld. However, it still falls just short of the OG handheld gaming PC for a few key reasons.</p>

<h2>
Asus ROG Xbox Ally pricing and availability
</h2><h3>
What does the entry-level Xbox handheld actually get you?
</h3>
<p>Because the ROG Xbox Ally is the entry-level Xbox handheld, it may seem a bit underpowered in terms of raw specs. The Xbox Ally is powered by the Ryzen Z2 A APU and features 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, a 512GB NvME M2 SSD, and a 7-inch, 1920x1080, 120Hz IPS display. In keeping with its status as the entry-level handheld, the Xbox Ally costs $599 and is available through Asus directly, or at popular retailers like Best Buy and Walmart.</p>    <p>While Microsoft and Asus picked a relatively low price point for the Xbox Ally, it's worth noting that the Steam Deck costs significantly less for its base 256GB model ($399), and even the 512GB OLED upgrade is still cheaper than the Xbox handheld at $549. Sure, the Xbox Ally has a higher screen resolution, but the it's still optimized for 720p performance. And at that point, the Steam Deck OLED gets you both a better bargain and a better display.</p>

<h2>
The Xbox Ally redesign
</h2><h3>
The Xbox hand grips may look dorky, but they're a genius design
</h3>

</div>
<p>When redesigning the Asus ROG Ally for the Xbox collaboration, Asus mimicked the classic Xbox controller grips for the handheld gaming PC. While this looks strange from a design perspective, the functionality of those ergonomic grips is more than worth the slightly dorky design.</p>    <p>I often complain about the weight of handheld gaming PCs being too much for extended game sessions, or how the grips are too flat or sharp to be fully ergonomic. Having your fingertips fall asleep while holding up the original Asus ROG Ally or MSI Claw 7 is a pretty common experience, and it's one you get to avoid with the Xbox Ally. Unlike the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lenovo-legion-go-2-review/" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go 2</a>, the Xbox Ally's hand grips have significantly better weight distribution, and the Xbox Ally is just under 1.4 pounds total, so using it for a few hours is beyond easy. I don't think any other handheld on the market currently feels as comfortable as the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X.</p>    <p>The Xbox Ally also has the classic Xbox controller buttons, complete with the coordinating colors for the A, B, X, and Y buttons. While it still looks recognizable as an Asus ROG product, the Xbox Ally also looks like it fits right in next to an Xbox Series S console. And when you think about it, the Xbox Ally is very much the Series S to the Xbox Ally X's Series X.</p>    <h2>
New Windows 11, same old problems
</h2><h3>
The Xbox Full Screen Experience makes a lot of promises
</h3>
<div>

<img alt="Playing Persona 4 Golden on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/asus-rog-xbox-ally-p4.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">

</div>
<p> As one of two devices to pioneer the reworked version of Windows 11 in the Xbox Full Screen Experience, the Xbox Ally has the potential to benefit from the streamlined Xbox experience, assuming you only play games through the Xbox app.</p>    <p>While you can go back to the Xbox Fullscreen Experience from the desktop, you'll still have to contend with that extra Windows 11 overhead. So you need to reboot the system to get the full performance benefits of the streamlined OS. And even then, if your game is from a third-party launcher, it will probably require booting the game from the full Windows desktop, once again voiding the benefits of the streamlined operating system.</p>    <p>The only surefire way to get the full benefit of the Xbox Fullscreen Experience is to only play Xbox or Game Pass titles. If you're a big Xbox fan or new to the PC gaming world, that's not so much of a drawback. But if most of your games are owned through a third-party storefront like Steam, Epic Games Store, or GOG, then it's not worth getting either Xbox handheld for the benefits of the trimmed-down UI, since you'll almost never get to benefit.</p>    <p>Microsoft and Asus will be pushing updates to the Xbox Fullscreen Experience, so it's possible this could get better over time. While Microsoft has not announced that the Xbox Fullscreen Experience will be hitting other handheld gaming PCs, there are some other handheld optimizations made to the base Windows 11 operating system that I could easily see getting pushed to other Windows handheld gaming PCs. The one I found the most useful was the updated Windows 11 on-screen keyboard, which now functions with the built-in handheld buttons, operating like the on-screen keyboard in the existing Xbox OS. So you've got the same controller shortcuts like pressing down the left thumbstick for caps and hitting LT for a keyboard of numbers and symbols. It's a small change, but considering how often you have to log in to various storefronts and launchers when gaming on PC, it's an absolute time saver.</p>    <h2>
Xbox Ally performance

The Ryzen Z2 A feels like a poor choice for Windows

<p> One of my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amds-fsr-4-could-save-the-asus-xbox-ally/" target="_blank">biggest concerns with the ROG Xbox Ally</a> was its underpowered, 4-core APU design. While the Steam Deck can get away with its 4-core APU by virtue of its low cost and the lower overhead of its custom Linux OS, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally doesn't have quite the same benefit. While the Xbox Ally is cheaper than other Windows-based handhelds, the base Asus ROG Ally is just $50 more expensive and gets you the more powerful Ryzen Z1 APU.</p>    <p>While Microsoft did a lot of work to make the streamlined Xbox Fullscreen Experience, the instant the handheld goes to the Windows 11 desktop, all those performance gains are lost as the full Windows 11 version boots up with all its extra features and background telemetry. So benchmarking the Xbox Ally meant dealing with the full Windows 11 overhead, leaving the Ally looking especially grim in comparison to more powerful Windows handhelds like the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/review-msi-claw-8-ai-plus-a2vm/" target="_blank">MSI Claw 8 AI+</a>, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review/" target="_blank">Asus ROG Ally X</a>, or Lenovo Legion Go 2.</p>    <p>All of my test games are owned through Steam and GOG, so even when benchmarking the Xbox Ally's gaming performance, I had to deal with that extra Windows 11 overhead. Though I restarted the handheld and launched the games from the Xbox Fullscreen Experience, I still had to go through Windows 11 to get them fully booted from Steam or GOG. All three games were benchmarked with the Xbox Ally at its full 24W TDP.</p>    <div>

<p>While utilizing AMD FSR upscaling and frame generation does get you smoother performance, the Xbox Ally's limited APU really does require medium or low settings to run smoothly at 720p, and you lose a lot of performance by upgrading to the handheld's max resolution.</p>    <p>Playing more indie titles, or ones designed for older hardware like <em>Persona 4 Golden</em> left me with a much better experience, so the Xbox Ally is really an indie or retro game machine. So if you plan to play more graphically intense games, opting for the more expensive Xbox Ally X is definitely worth the increased investment.</p>    <p>As far as battery life goes, the Xbox Ally lasted 2 hours and 25 minutes on the PCMark 10 gaming battery test, with the system's brightness set to 50% the handheld set to its 15W unplugged default power profile. I got much less time while running <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, as the Xbox Ally was drained nearly to 0% after just a few daily roulettes, but then again online games do tend to drain far more battery power than offline titles.</p>    <p>You can also get a decent bit more time with the handheld at the Silent (6W) profile, but that's ideal for indie titles like <em>Hades II</em> or <em>Hollow Knight</em> rather than <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>.</p>    <h2>
Should you buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally?
</h2><p><strong>You should buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
You don't own a gaming handheld
</li>
<li>
You're looking for a smooth transition from the Xbox console to a handheld gaming PC
</li>
<li>
Most of your games are purchased through Xbox or GamePass
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should NOT buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
You already own a gaming handheld
</li>
<li>
You want the best handheld gaming bargain
</li>
<li>
Most of your games are owned through non-Xbox storefronts like Steam, Epic Games, GOG, etc
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is a great transition devices for those looking to start dipping their toes into the PC gaming space, since the streamlined Xbox Fullscreen Experience works best with the Xbox and GamePass libraries, rather than outside launchers. It can be a great secondary console to break up arguments between families.</p>    <p>But more serious Xbox gamers and PC enthusiasts will want to save up a bit more for the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X since it's more powerful, and can handle the latest AAA game titles better than its entry-level sibling. Meanwhile, those searching for the best bargain in handheld gaming will find no better deal than the Steam Deck. It has similar or better performance to the Xbox Ally, and is still cheaper even with the OLED display upgrade.</p>

<p>The original Asus ROG Ally launched over two years ago, and there have been varying iterations of Windows gaming handhelds ever since, from MSI, Lenovo, and more. They've all suffered from the same problem: Windows. Until now. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X has a brand-new full-screen UI, along with next-gen internals, of course.</p>    <p>If you've never owned a Windows gaming handheld, it's not hard to imagine. It's just a Windows desktop on a tiny screen, but instead of a mouse, you have to try and use a touchscreen to interact with tiny game icons. There's usually some OEM software on top that tries to do better, but it's not great.</p>    <p>The new Xbox UI is fantastic. That's it, this is the best gaming handheld now. It's pricey, and you won't find any SteamOS handhelds at this price because Valve doesn't want it, but that also means you won't get a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-z2-extreme-chip-announcement/" target="_blank">Z2 Extreme</a> chip with SteamOS.</p>    <p>Microsoft didn't just deliver a friendlier UI either. It's lighter too, not loading Windows system components that would typically hog memory.</p>

The new Xbox shell makes all the difference

Finally, Windows can be good on a small screen

<p>I cannot put into words how bad Windows is on a seven-inch screen. Indeed, I asked HP once why it never made a gaming handheld, and I was told in no uncertain terms that the company simply wouldn't make a product with that bad of an experience. You can imagine it though, because it's just like using your computer, only much smaller.</p>    <p>This new experience is so much better. It's not just some "optimized" version of the same thing, like we've seen on Windows 11 touch mode. It's familiar, taking familiar parts of the Xbox app, and it's making it into what's more or less a shell.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>The new experience is revamped and better, yet totally familiar.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>There's a navigation panel that runs down the left side of the screen that you're familiar with: home, Game Pass, your library, cloud gaming, and the store. If you swipe in from the left, you get the Game Bar overlay. If you swipe up from the bottom, you get a multitasking view that lets you switch between game/apps, close them, and sometimes critically, switch to the Windows desktop.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Let's talk about switching to the Windows desktop, because it's there if you need it. Just like any other Windows handheld, you could plug it into a monitor and use it as a full PC.</p>    <p>But Microsoft was smart about this. When the ROG Xbox Ally X boots into the Xbox app, it's not loading everything it typically would on a normal Windows boot. We were told that this frees up about 2GB of memory, which will boost performance. When you switch to the desktop, it's loading those other components.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>Finally, Windows is great on small screens, and it doesn't have the limitations that SteamOS has.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>To get back to the full-screen Xbox UI, there's a button in the top-right of the Xbox app. When you hit it, it's going to suggest that you reboot so you get those performance optimizations back. It's not mandatory, if you're willing to stick with the compromises.</p>    <p>But to be clear, this product runs full Windows. It's not something that can only play Xbox console games, and in fact, it can't play console-only games. If you want those, you have to use cloud streaming. I mention full Windows because you can run games from anywhere you want, just like you'd expect. Steam games work great.</p>    <p>I do like it better than SteamOS for that reason. The ROG Xbox Ally is way more powerful than a Steam Deck, and it can run <em>all</em> of the games you want. You can't run Xbox Game Pass games on SteamOS (I 100% expect to be reading comments from the mad geniuses that can get that to work).</p>    <h2>
It's designed like an Xbox controller
</h2><h3>
Everything about this screams Xbox
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1118062346" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1118062346" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1118062346" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1118062346" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1118062346-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the most notable difference between the design of the ROG Ally X and the ROG Xbox Ally X is that this one is shaped like an Xbox controller, at least on the sides. It's completely designed to feel like you're playing an Xbox, which is cool. It's probably the most comfortable gaming handheld that I've used. It feels natural.</p>    <p>It has the familiar joysticks and buttons, although I have a gripe with the fact that the buttons are <em>not</em> colored, like they would be on an Xbox controller. It's even more painful because they are colored on the ROG Xbox Ally, which has a white chassis. I do not know why this design choice was made. In fact, given the same dimensions of each, I have no idea why you can't just choose your color.</p>    <p>The two buttons on each side of the screen are still there from the original ROG Ally series, but there's a new button just above the directional pad, the Xbox button. You can probably guess what it does; it takes you right back to the Xbox UI. Indeed, like I said when I talked about the experience, it's all different, yet familiar. If you're an Xbox user, you should be able to figure out how this works.</p>    <h2>
Performance: The Z2 Extreme is better than the Z1 Extreme

<p>The ROG Xbox Ally uses AMD's shiny (I don't know, I obviously haven't seen it but we'll assume it's shiny) new Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor. It's got eight cores in a mix of Zen 5 and Zen 5c. Notably, not all of the Z2 lineup is Zen 5 at all. The Z2 A in the ROG Xbox Ally non-X is quad-core Zen 2. The Z2 Go that was in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lenovo-legion-go-steamos-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Lenovo's Legion Go S</a> is Zen 3+. In fact, for the Legion Go S, the Z2 Go was considered the lower-end variant of the product, while the more expensive one still used a Z1 Extreme.</p>    <p>The Z2 Extreme is the proper successor, and big surprise, it's faster and better. Battery life has been multiple hours, more than I can say about the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lenovo-legion-go-review/" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, although the ROG Xbox Ally X has a big old 80Wh battery.</p>    <p>Here, have some benchmarks:</p>    <div>

<p>As always, keep in mind that Geekbench 6 and Cinebench 2024 are just CPU tests, while 3DMark paints a more complete picture.</p>    <p>The somewhat bad news is that it still feels like you're playing games on a laptop with integrated graphics, which isn't necessarily a terrible thing. It's just not a great thing. Games can take a while to load, and performance is still just fine on most games. The more graphics-intensive it is, the harder it will be.</p>    <p>For anyone that's used a PC gaming handheld, this doesn't come as a surprise. If you're thinking of it like it's a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/nintendo-switch-2-review/" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> but for PC games, that's not quite what you're getting.</p>    <p>Now, let's talk about the Xbox experience and if it really improves performance. The answer is that, well, it doesn't <em>hurt</em> performance. In the benchmarks I ran comparing the Xbox mode to running the same game from the Windows desktop, the results were at worst the same, and at best about 2fps better in Xbox mode.</p>    <div>

<p>At an event in New York where we were briefed on the ROG Xbox Ally series, people asked if they should buy an Xbox console or the handheld, and the answer was...both. Representatives from Asus, Microsoft, and AMD were there, and while Asus would certainly prefer you to buy a ROG Xbox Ally, the other two parties talked about this as being a <em>companion device</em>.</p>    <p>It's not, of course. It would be ridiculous to go say you should spend twice as much as you did on your console, on a companion device. This is a standalone product, for gamers that want to play games on the go, or even at home but not on the big screen.</p>    <h2>

<p>I saved this section for last because it's more along the lines of commentary, but why does the ROG Xbox Ally series exist? It definitely makes sense for Asus, partnering up with Microsoft on a handheld Xbox. It just doesn't make sense for Microsoft.</p>    <p>First of all, Microsoft makes hardware, as we all know. In case you don't know, you've probably been wondering what that whole "Xbox" term I've been throwing around means. We're not going to go there.</p>    <p>But if Microsoft wanted a handheld Xbox, it could've just made one. This is a proper PC though, so if it was more about making a proper UX for a gaming handheld, I'm not sure why it didn't just make it and give it to everyone.</p>    <p>Microsoft isn't confirming if this new full-screen experience is coming to other devices. I'd be absolutely baffled if it didn't though. It's just running through the Xbox app and the Xbox Game Bar.</p>    <p>Companies like Asus, Lenovo, and MSI have been putting out incredible hardware with an awful software experience for over two years, dealing with reviews on <em>their</em> products complaining about <em>Microsoft's</em> software. The least Microsoft could do is just make this new shell an option.</p>    <p>And again, I'm sure it will be an option at some point. It's just that partnering up with Asus on a device feels like an odd choice.</p>    <h2>
Should you buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X?
</h2><p><strong>You should buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
You want a PC gaming handheld
</li>
<li>
You want the best performance a gaming handheld can offer
</li>
<li>
You like the feel of an Xbox controller
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should <em>not</em> buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
You're not gaming on the go / away from a computer or console
</li>
<li>
You need the most power, fastest load times, best frame rates, etc.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X is the best gaming handheld on the market. It finally fixes the glaring problems that have historically come from using Windows with the form factor, and it doesn't come with the limitations that you get from SteamOS. On top of that, it's got the best gaming handheld chip under the hood.</p>    <p>The big problem is that it costs a thousand dollars. If you're just looking for the ability to play games on a travel device with a screen, the Switch 2 is still way more cost-effective, although you can probably manipulate those numbers if you play enough games on Game Pass. You also, of course, get to play all of the games that you already own.</p>    <p>But if you're looking for a PC gaming handheld, this is the one to get.</p>

<p>The original Asus ROG Ally launched over two years ago, and there have been varying iterations of Windows gaming handhelds ever since, from MSI, Lenovo, and more. They've all suffered from the same problem: Windows. Until now. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X has a brand-new full-screen UI, along with next-gen internals, of course.</p>    <p>If you've never owned a Windows gaming handheld, it's not hard to imagine. It's just a Windows desktop on a tiny screen, but instead of a mouse, you have to try and use a touchscreen to interact with tiny game icons. There's usually some OEM software on top that tries to do better, but it's not great.</p>    <p>The new Xbox UI is fantastic. That's it, this is the best gaming handheld now. It's pricey, and you won't find any SteamOS handhelds at this price because Valve doesn't want it, but that also means you won't get a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-z2-extreme-chip-announcement/" target="_blank">Z2 Extreme</a> chip with SteamOS.</p>    <p>Microsoft didn't just deliver a friendlier UI either. It's lighter too, not loading Windows system components that would typically hog memory.</p>

<p>I cannot put into words how bad Windows is on a seven-inch screen. Indeed, I asked HP once why it never made a gaming handheld, and I was told in no uncertain terms that the company simply wouldn't make a product with that bad of an experience. You can imagine it though, because it's just like using your computer, only much smaller.</p>    <p>This new experience is so much better. It's not just some "optimized" version of the same thing, like we've seen on Windows 11 touch mode. It's familiar, taking familiar parts of the Xbox app, and it's making it into what's more or less a shell.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>The new experience is revamped and better, yet totally familiar.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>There's a navigation panel that runs down the left side of the screen that you're familiar with: home, Game Pass, your library, cloud gaming, and the store. If you swipe in from the left, you get the Game Bar overlay. If you swipe up from the bottom, you get a multitasking view that lets you switch between game/apps, close them, and sometimes critically, switch to the Windows desktop.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Let's talk about switching to the Windows desktop, because it's there if you need it. Just like any other Windows handheld, you could plug it into a monitor and use it as a full PC.</p>    <p>But Microsoft was smart about this. When the ROG Xbox Ally X boots into the Xbox app, it's not loading everything it typically would on a normal Windows boot. We were told that this frees up about 2GB of memory, which will boost performance. When you switch to the desktop, it's loading those other components.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>Finally, Windows is great on small screens, and it doesn't have the limitations that SteamOS has.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>To get back to the full-screen Xbox UI, there's a button in the top-right of the Xbox app. When you hit it, it's going to suggest that you reboot so you get those performance optimizations back. It's not mandatory, if you're willing to stick with the compromises.</p>    <p>But to be clear, this product runs full Windows. It's not something that can only play Xbox console games, and in fact, it can't play console-only games. If you want those, you have to use cloud streaming. I mention full Windows because you can run games from anywhere you want, just like you'd expect. Steam games work great.</p>    <p>I do like it better than SteamOS for that reason. The ROG Xbox Ally is way more powerful than a Steam Deck, and it can run <em>all</em> of the games you want. You can't run Xbox Game Pass games on SteamOS (I 100% expect to be reading comments from the mad geniuses that can get that to work).</p>    <h2>
It's designed like an Xbox controller
</h2><h3>
Everything about this screams Xbox

</div>
<p>One of the most notable difference between the design of the ROG Ally X and the ROG Xbox Ally X is that this one is shaped like an Xbox controller, at least on the sides. It's completely designed to feel like you're playing an Xbox, which is cool. It's probably the most comfortable gaming handheld that I've used. It feels natural.</p>    <p>It has the familiar joysticks and buttons, although I have a gripe with the fact that the buttons are <em>not</em> colored, like they would be on an Xbox controller. It's even more painful because they are colored on the ROG Xbox Ally, which has a white chassis. I do not know why this design choice was made. In fact, given the same dimensions of each, I have no idea why you can't just choose your color.</p>    <p>The two buttons on each side of the screen are still there from the original ROG Ally series, but there's a new button just above the directional pad, the Xbox button. You can probably guess what it does; it takes you right back to the Xbox UI. Indeed, like I said when I talked about the experience, it's all different, yet familiar. If you're an Xbox user, you should be able to figure out how this works.</p>    <h2>

<p>The ROG Xbox Ally uses AMD's shiny (I don't know, I obviously haven't seen it but we'll assume it's shiny) new Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor. It's got eight cores in a mix of Zen 5 and Zen 5c. Notably, not all of the Z2 lineup is Zen 5 at all. The Z2 A in the ROG Xbox Ally non-X is quad-core Zen 2. The Z2 Go that was in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lenovo-legion-go-steamos-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Lenovo's Legion Go S</a> is Zen 3+. In fact, for the Legion Go S, the Z2 Go was considered the lower-end variant of the product, while the more expensive one still used a Z1 Extreme.</p>    <p>The Z2 Extreme is the proper successor, and big surprise, it's faster and better. Battery life has been multiple hours, more than I can say about the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lenovo-legion-go-review/" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, although the ROG Xbox Ally X has a big old 80Wh battery.</p>    <p>Here, have some benchmarks:</p>    <div>

<p>As always, keep in mind that Geekbench 6 and Cinebench 2024 are just CPU tests, while 3DMark paints a more complete picture.</p>    <p>The somewhat bad news is that it still feels like you're playing games on a laptop with integrated graphics, which isn't necessarily a terrible thing. It's just not a great thing. Games can take a while to load, and performance is still just fine on most games. The more graphics-intensive it is, the harder it will be.</p>    <p>For anyone that's used a PC gaming handheld, this doesn't come as a surprise. If you're thinking of it like it's a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/nintendo-switch-2-review/" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> but for PC games, that's not quite what you're getting.</p>    <p>Now, let's talk about the Xbox experience and if it really improves performance. The answer is that, well, it doesn't <em>hurt</em> performance. In the benchmarks I ran comparing the Xbox mode to running the same game from the Windows desktop, the results were at worst the same, and at best about 2fps better in Xbox mode.</p>    <div>

<p>At an event in New York where we were briefed on the ROG Xbox Ally series, people asked if they should buy an Xbox console or the handheld, and the answer was...both. Representatives from Asus, Microsoft, and AMD were there, and while Asus would certainly prefer you to buy a ROG Xbox Ally, the other two parties talked about this as being a <em>companion device</em>.</p>    <p>It's not, of course. It would be ridiculous to go say you should spend twice as much as you did on your console, on a companion device. This is a standalone product, for gamers that want to play games on the go, or even at home but not on the big screen.</p>    <h2>
I'm actually not sure why the ROG Xbox Ally X exists
</h2><h3>
It's great for Asus, but also, why?
</h3>
<div>

<p>I saved this section for last because it's more along the lines of commentary, but why does the ROG Xbox Ally series exist? It definitely makes sense for Asus, partnering up with Microsoft on a handheld Xbox. It just doesn't make sense for Microsoft.</p>    <p>First of all, Microsoft makes hardware, as we all know. In case you don't know, you've probably been wondering what that whole "Xbox" term I've been throwing around means. We're not going to go there.</p>    <p>But if Microsoft wanted a handheld Xbox, it could've just made one. This is a proper PC though, so if it was more about making a proper UX for a gaming handheld, I'm not sure why it didn't just make it and give it to everyone.</p>    <p>Microsoft isn't confirming if this new full-screen experience is coming to other devices. I'd be absolutely baffled if it didn't though. It's just running through the Xbox app and the Xbox Game Bar.</p>    <p>Companies like Asus, Lenovo, and MSI have been putting out incredible hardware with an awful software experience for over two years, dealing with reviews on <em>their</em> products complaining about <em>Microsoft's</em> software. The least Microsoft could do is just make this new shell an option.</p>    <p>And again, I'm sure it will be an option at some point. It's just that partnering up with Asus on a device feels like an odd choice.</p>    <h2>
Should you buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X?
</h2><p><strong>You should buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
You want a PC gaming handheld
</li>
<li>
You want the best performance a gaming handheld can offer
</li>
<li>
You like the feel of an Xbox controller
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should <em>not</em> buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
You're not gaming on the go / away from a computer or console
</li>
<li>
You need the most power, fastest load times, best frame rates, etc.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X is the best gaming handheld on the market. It finally fixes the glaring problems that have historically come from using Windows with the form factor, and it doesn't come with the limitations that you get from SteamOS. On top of that, it's got the best gaming handheld chip under the hood.</p>    <p>The big problem is that it costs a thousand dollars. If you're just looking for the ability to play games on a travel device with a screen, the Switch 2 is still way more cost-effective, although you can probably manipulate those numbers if you play enough games on Game Pass. You also, of course, get to play all of the games that you already own.</p>    <p>But if you're looking for a PC gaming handheld, this is the one to get.</p>

<p>The original Asus ROG Ally launched over two years ago, and there have been varying iterations of Windows gaming handhelds ever since, from MSI, Lenovo, and more. They've all suffered from the same problem: Windows. Until now. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X has a brand-new full-screen UI, along with next-gen internals, of course.</p>    <p>If you've never owned a Windows gaming handheld, it's not hard to imagine. It's just a Windows desktop on a tiny screen, but instead of a mouse, you have to try and use a touchscreen to interact with tiny game icons. There's usually some OEM software on top that tries to do better, but it's not great.</p>    <p>The new Xbox UI is fantastic. That's it, this is the best gaming handheld now. It's pricey, and you won't find any SteamOS handhelds at this price because Valve doesn't want it, but that also means you won't get a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-z2-extreme-chip-announcement/" target="_blank">Z2 Extreme</a> chip with SteamOS.</p>    <p>Microsoft didn't just deliver a friendlier UI either. It's lighter too, not loading Windows system components that would typically hog memory.</p>

<p>I cannot put into words how bad Windows is on a seven-inch screen. Indeed, I asked HP once why it never made a gaming handheld, and I was told in no uncertain terms that the company simply wouldn't make a product with that bad of an experience. You can imagine it though, because it's just like using your computer, only much smaller.</p>    <p>This new experience is so much better. It's not just some "optimized" version of the same thing, like we've seen on Windows 11 touch mode. It's familiar, taking familiar parts of the Xbox app, and it's making it into what's more or less a shell.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>The new experience is revamped and better, yet totally familiar.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>There's a navigation panel that runs down the left side of the screen that you're familiar with: home, Game Pass, your library, cloud gaming, and the store. If you swipe in from the left, you get the Game Bar overlay. If you swipe up from the bottom, you get a multitasking view that lets you switch between game/apps, close them, and sometimes critically, switch to the Windows desktop.</p>

<p>Let's talk about switching to the Windows desktop, because it's there if you need it. Just like any other Windows handheld, you could plug it into a monitor and use it as a full PC.</p>    <p>But Microsoft was smart about this. When the ROG Xbox Ally X boots into the Xbox app, it's not loading everything it typically would on a normal Windows boot. We were told that this frees up about 2GB of memory, which will boost performance. When you switch to the desktop, it's loading those other components.</p>

</section><p>To get back to the full-screen Xbox UI, there's a button in the top-right of the Xbox app. When you hit it, it's going to suggest that you reboot so you get those performance optimizations back. It's not mandatory, if you're willing to stick with the compromises.</p>    <p>But to be clear, this product runs full Windows. It's not something that can only play Xbox console games, and in fact, it can't play console-only games. If you want those, you have to use cloud streaming. I mention full Windows because you can run games from anywhere you want, just like you'd expect. Steam games work great.</p>    <p>I do like it better than SteamOS for that reason. The ROG Xbox Ally is way more powerful than a Steam Deck, and it can run <em>all</em> of the games you want. You can't run Xbox Game Pass games on SteamOS (I 100% expect to be reading comments from the mad geniuses that can get that to work).</p>    <h2>
It's designed like an Xbox controller

Everything about this screams Xbox

<p>One of the most notable difference between the design of the ROG Ally X and the ROG Xbox Ally X is that this one is shaped like an Xbox controller, at least on the sides. It's completely designed to feel like you're playing an Xbox, which is cool. It's probably the most comfortable gaming handheld that I've used. It feels natural.</p>    <p>It has the familiar joysticks and buttons, although I have a gripe with the fact that the buttons are <em>not</em> colored, like they would be on an Xbox controller. It's even more painful because they are colored on the ROG Xbox Ally, which has a white chassis. I do not know why this design choice was made. In fact, given the same dimensions of each, I have no idea why you can't just choose your color.</p>    <p>The two buttons on each side of the screen are still there from the original ROG Ally series, but there's a new button just above the directional pad, the Xbox button. You can probably guess what it does; it takes you right back to the Xbox UI. Indeed, like I said when I talked about the experience, it's all different, yet familiar. If you're an Xbox user, you should be able to figure out how this works.</p>    <h2>
Performance: The Z2 Extreme is better than the Z1 Extreme

<p>The ROG Xbox Ally uses AMD's shiny (I don't know, I obviously haven't seen it but we'll assume it's shiny) new Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor. It's got eight cores in a mix of Zen 5 and Zen 5c. Notably, not all of the Z2 lineup is Zen 5 at all. The Z2 A in the ROG Xbox Ally non-X is quad-core Zen 2. The Z2 Go that was in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lenovo-legion-go-steamos-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Lenovo's Legion Go S</a> is Zen 3+. In fact, for the Legion Go S, the Z2 Go was considered the lower-end variant of the product, while the more expensive one still used a Z1 Extreme.</p>    <p>The Z2 Extreme is the proper successor, and big surprise, it's faster and better. Battery life has been multiple hours, more than I can say about the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lenovo-legion-go-review/" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, although the ROG Xbox Ally X has a big old 80Wh battery.</p>    <p>Here, have some benchmarks:</p>    <div>

<p>As always, keep in mind that Geekbench 6 and Cinebench 2024 are just CPU tests, while 3DMark paints a more complete picture.</p>    <p>The somewhat bad news is that it still feels like you're playing games on a laptop with integrated graphics, which isn't necessarily a terrible thing. It's just not a great thing. Games can take a while to load, and performance is still just fine on most games. The more graphics-intensive it is, the harder it will be.</p>    <p>For anyone that's used a PC gaming handheld, this doesn't come as a surprise. If you're thinking of it like it's a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/nintendo-switch-2-review/" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> but for PC games, that's not quite what you're getting.</p>    <p>Now, let's talk about the Xbox experience and if it really improves performance. The answer is that, well, it doesn't <em>hurt</em> performance. In the benchmarks I ran comparing the Xbox mode to running the same game from the Windows desktop, the results were at worst the same, and at best about 2fps better in Xbox mode.</p>    <div>

<p>At an event in New York where we were briefed on the ROG Xbox Ally series, people asked if they should buy an Xbox console or the handheld, and the answer was...both. Representatives from Asus, Microsoft, and AMD were there, and while Asus would certainly prefer you to buy a ROG Xbox Ally, the other two parties talked about this as being a <em>companion device</em>.</p>    <p>It's not, of course. It would be ridiculous to go say you should spend twice as much as you did on your console, on a companion device. This is a standalone product, for gamers that want to play games on the go, or even at home but not on the big screen.</p>    <h2>
I'm actually not sure why the ROG Xbox Ally X exists
</h2><h3>
It's great for Asus, but also, why?
</h3>

<p>I saved this section for last because it's more along the lines of commentary, but why does the ROG Xbox Ally series exist? It definitely makes sense for Asus, partnering up with Microsoft on a handheld Xbox. It just doesn't make sense for Microsoft.</p>    <p>First of all, Microsoft makes hardware, as we all know. In case you don't know, you've probably been wondering what that whole "Xbox" term I've been throwing around means. We're not going to go there.</p>    <p>But if Microsoft wanted a handheld Xbox, it could've just made one. This is a proper PC though, so if it was more about making a proper UX for a gaming handheld, I'm not sure why it didn't just make it and give it to everyone.</p>    <p>Microsoft isn't confirming if this new full-screen experience is coming to other devices. I'd be absolutely baffled if it didn't though. It's just running through the Xbox app and the Xbox Game Bar.</p>    <p>Companies like Asus, Lenovo, and MSI have been putting out incredible hardware with an awful software experience for over two years, dealing with reviews on <em>their</em> products complaining about <em>Microsoft's</em> software. The least Microsoft could do is just make this new shell an option.</p>    <p>And again, I'm sure it will be an option at some point. It's just that partnering up with Asus on a device feels like an odd choice.</p>    <h2>
Should you buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X?
</h2><p><strong>You should buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
You want a PC gaming handheld
</li>
<li>
You want the best performance a gaming handheld can offer
</li>
<li>
You like the feel of an Xbox controller
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should <em>not</em> buy the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
You're not gaming on the go / away from a computer or console
</li>
<li>
You need the most power, fastest load times, best frame rates, etc.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X is the best gaming handheld on the market. It finally fixes the glaring problems that have historically come from using Windows with the form factor, and it doesn't come with the limitations that you get from SteamOS. On top of that, it's got the best gaming handheld chip under the hood.</p>    <p>The big problem is that it costs a thousand dollars. If you're just looking for the ability to play games on a travel device with a screen, the Switch 2 is still way more cost-effective, although you can probably manipulate those numbers if you play enough games on Game Pass. You also, of course, get to play all of the games that you already own.</p>    <p>But if you're looking for a PC gaming handheld, this is the one to get.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>NotebookLM is one of the few generative AI tools that has really impressed me, but this doesn't mean that it doesn't have flaws. There's a lot <span>it <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/features-notebooklm-does-better-than-alternatives/" target="_blank">does better than its competitors</a>, including letting</span> you set the sources you want to use.</p>    <p>That said, it also has drawbacks, especially with some of its newer features. Here are a few things I think NotebookLM should work on to improve the tool's usability.</p>    <h2>
The bare-bones source view
</h2><h3>
Revisiting sources is not exactly seamless
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="view of text source in notebooklm" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/view-of-text-source-in-notebooklm.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> When Google first announced its partnership with OpenStax to bring some of its most popular textbooks to NotebookLM, I was really excited to jump into the content. I love learning new things, especially when it comes to interests I wasn't able to pursue during university. One of these is psychology, so I was delighted to see that a notebook introducing psychology was included in the partnership.</p>    <p>However, this is also when I noticed how limiting NotebookLM's view of sources is. I didn't really want to ask the chatbot questions about the content until I had read it myself. But viewing sources within NotebookLM is really inefficient.</p>    <p>Firstly, the <strong>Sources</strong> pane can only take up about a third of the screen. If you close the <strong>Studio</strong> pane, it only expands the footprint of the <strong>Chat</strong> pane. You can zoom in on your browser until the chat disappears, but by the time this happens, you're not seeing much text from the sources.</p>    <p>Then there's the formatting. Sources are mostly formatted in plain text, so you lack the benefits of header formatting. You get the occasional bold and italic text, but it actually doesn't stand out much from the rest of the text. The OpenStax chapters also included occasional images, but far fewer than the original documents. I eventually decided to just use the original OpenStax resources rather than NotebookLM.</p>    <p>But my experience made me notice just how limited the source view is. When you upload documents from the web or your Google Drive, you can at least visit the original link to see the source in its original formatting, along with images. But if you upload a PDF directly to NotebookLM, the scraped text is the only copy you have.</p>    <p>The quality of the text scraping also seems to differ depending on whether you use direct upload or Google Drive, even when uploading the same document. I think this really hampers the potential of NotebookLM as a learning resource for material you're completely unfamiliar with, if you would like to first view the original information.</p>    <h2>
Revising videos and audio according to prompts
</h2><h3>
Not much changes with certain prompts
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="video overview on migraine and fibromyalgia" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/video-overview-on-migraine-and-fibromyalgia.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> One of the ways I've used NotebookLM is to explain my complex chronic illnesses to family members in an accessible way. I created a video explaining chronic migraines and their causes to help them better understand the challenges of treating the condition.</p>    <p>The first video, however, was very general. I hadn't entered a prompt, so I decided to create a new video with some specific prompts. This included asking the chatbot to explain what treatments were used for people who had failed first-line and second-line preventative treatments, as this is the situation I'm dealing with.</p>    <p>However, the newly generated video barely addressed this point, devoting less than 30 seconds to it in the nearly 8-minute video. It mostly just reiterated the same points as the first video. I also checked that the chatbot could generate this information in the chat, which it could, meaning it wasn't due to a limitation in the sources.</p>    <p>In fact, the biggest difference between the videos was that the narrator changed from a masculine to a feminine voice. I decided to go with the second video just because the narrator was less loud, which helps with my noise sensitivity.</p>    <p>I later tried to generate a video focusing specifically on the link between chronic migraine and fibromyalgia. Once again, I confirmed the chatbot was able to pull this information from the sources through a text prompt. However, when I generated a video, the video once again covered the same ground. It defined the difference between chronic and episodic migraine, and used the same line about migraine not being "just a really bad headache".</p>    <p>Almost halfway through the video, it eventually got to the topic of comorbidities. But then it wasted time explaining the definition of comorbidities. After three minutes, it listed the common comorbidities. Over half the video was done before it started, discussing what I had prompted: the link between chronic migraine and fibromyalgia. It briefly discussed this, then recycled information from the other videos.</p>    <p>Video overviews are still an impressive tool, but if they really want to be useful, they need to truly tweak their output to prompts, rather than recycling the same content with minimal changes.</p>    <h2>
YouTube video citations
</h2><h3>
They're lacking essential features
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-664992371" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-664992371" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-664992371" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-664992371" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-664992371-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>NotebookLM does a great job of citing its answers. It also makes it easy to locate the relevant parts of documents for citations, especially text sources, by highlighting the cited information. However, for video sources, the chatbot is much less effective.</p>    <p>When you click a citation from a video source, NotebookLM opens the embedded video and its transcript. However, it doesn't provide timestamps, which makes it difficult to find the relevant part of the video. I have also noticed it highlighting the entire transcript multiple times, rather than the most relevant part. In these cases, hovering over the citation also caused the pop-up to display the entire transcript rather than a focused excerpt. I've encountered this issue across multiple notebooks, so it's not just limited to one or two cases.</p>    <p>While I mostly use text sources with NotebookLM, I first noticed this shortcoming when creating a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/using-notebooklm-for-exercise-routine/" target="_blank">customized workout routine</a> with the chatbot. It was also frustrating when using the chatbot for certain gaming guides. I imagine that if you're dealing with particularly long videos, the lack of timestamps can become especially frustrating.</p>    <h2>
The ineffective Android app
</h2><h3>
It's disappointing compared to the web version
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="notebooklm on google play store" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/notebooklm-on-google-play-store-1.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>NotebookLM is a cloud-based app, so I'd argue that mobile functionality is important. However, the mobile experience, at least what I've tried on Android, pales in comparison to the web version. Now it's worth noting that the store page notes that this is an early version of the NotebookLM app, but it has been out since May 2025, so I expected that it would be further along than it is.</p>    <p>My main gripe with the app is that while it syncs the notebooks you have saved, it doesn't sync most of your saved Studio output. I can find the occasional audio overview, but my mind maps, FAQs, and saved responses are not available in the app. I understand it not having access to some of the latest features like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/notebooklm-new-features-update/" target="_blank">quizzes and flashcards</a>, but it's frustrating when <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ways-i-use-notebooklms-mind-maps/" target="_blank">mind maps</a> and notes aren't saved either.</p>    <p>In addition, featured notebooks I've accessed out of curiosity are mixed in with my actual notebooks, with no way to remove them. Meanwhile, the source view is even more limiting because there is no way to visit the original website you have referenced.</p>    <p>The limitations of NotebookLM are essentially amplified when it comes to the mobile app.</p>    <h2>
Obtrusive featured notebooks

They feel a bit like ads

<p>Featured notebooks were rolled out to NotebookLM in mid-2025. While I was initially excited to see what they could offer, I was left underwhelmed by the actual experience. But eventually, these notebooks were more than just underwhelming; they were actually annoying.</p>    <p>This is because Google has placed them at the top of the NotebookLM home page, above your actual notebooks. This means that the first thing you're greeted by is featured notebooks, which have not seen any additions since July. This applies both to the grid and list view, as well as if you sort your notebooks by most recent.</p>    <p>As a result, notebooks I have never visited get precedence on my home page over my own saved notebooks. Since they're rarely updated, I can't even say that this is a feature that helps you discover new content. Rather, it just feels like a way to advertise books and publications.</p>    <p>Newer partnerships, like the one Google has with OpenStax, don't even feature in this section. And in the mobile app, if you've visited one of these notebooks, they remain on your home page with no way to remove them.</p>    <p>I would honestly prefer that this section be replaced by pinned notebooks, notes, and overviews, rather than something that doesn't feel useful at all.</p>    <h3>
NotebookLM still has room to improve
</h3>
<p>There's a lot I like about NotebookLM, and I'll continue to use the tool to summarize large amounts of information in a digestible way. At the same time, I hope that Google fixes these issues, since it is one of the most promising experiments to come out of Google Labs.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>NotebookLM is one of the few generative AI tools that has really impressed me, but this doesn't mean that it doesn't have flaws. There's a lot <span>it <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/features-notebooklm-does-better-than-alternatives/" target="_blank">does better than its competitors</a>, including letting</span> you set the sources you want to use.</p>    <p>That said, it also has drawbacks, especially with some of its newer features. Here are a few things I think NotebookLM should work on to improve the tool's usability.</p>    <h2>
The bare-bones source view
</h2><h3>
Revisiting sources is not exactly seamless
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="view of text source in notebooklm" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/view-of-text-source-in-notebooklm.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> When Google first announced its partnership with OpenStax to bring some of its most popular textbooks to NotebookLM, I was really excited to jump into the content. I love learning new things, especially when it comes to interests I wasn't able to pursue during university. One of these is psychology, so I was delighted to see that a notebook introducing psychology was included in the partnership.</p>    <p>However, this is also when I noticed how limiting NotebookLM's view of sources is. I didn't really want to ask the chatbot questions about the content until I had read it myself. But viewing sources within NotebookLM is really inefficient.</p>    <p>Firstly, the <strong>Sources</strong> pane can only take up about a third of the screen. If you close the <strong>Studio</strong> pane, it only expands the footprint of the <strong>Chat</strong> pane. You can zoom in on your browser until the chat disappears, but by the time this happens, you're not seeing much text from the sources.</p>    <p>Then there's the formatting. Sources are mostly formatted in plain text, so you lack the benefits of header formatting. You get the occasional bold and italic text, but it actually doesn't stand out much from the rest of the text. The OpenStax chapters also included occasional images, but far fewer than the original documents. I eventually decided to just use the original OpenStax resources rather than NotebookLM.</p>    <p>But my experience made me notice just how limited the source view is. When you upload documents from the web or your Google Drive, you can at least visit the original link to see the source in its original formatting, along with images. But if you upload a PDF directly to NotebookLM, the scraped text is the only copy you have.</p>    <p>The quality of the text scraping also seems to differ depending on whether you use direct upload or Google Drive, even when uploading the same document. I think this really hampers the potential of NotebookLM as a learning resource for material you're completely unfamiliar with, if you would like to first view the original information.</p>    <h2>
Revising videos and audio according to prompts
</h2><h3>
Not much changes with certain prompts
</h3>
<div>

<img alt="video overview on migraine and fibromyalgia" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/video-overview-on-migraine-and-fibromyalgia.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> One of the ways I've used NotebookLM is to explain my complex chronic illnesses to family members in an accessible way. I created a video explaining chronic migraines and their causes to help them better understand the challenges of treating the condition.</p>    <p>The first video, however, was very general. I hadn't entered a prompt, so I decided to create a new video with some specific prompts. This included asking the chatbot to explain what treatments were used for people who had failed first-line and second-line preventative treatments, as this is the situation I'm dealing with.</p>    <p>However, the newly generated video barely addressed this point, devoting less than 30 seconds to it in the nearly 8-minute video. It mostly just reiterated the same points as the first video. I also checked that the chatbot could generate this information in the chat, which it could, meaning it wasn't due to a limitation in the sources.</p>    <p>In fact, the biggest difference between the videos was that the narrator changed from a masculine to a feminine voice. I decided to go with the second video just because the narrator was less loud, which helps with my noise sensitivity.</p>    <p>I later tried to generate a video focusing specifically on the link between chronic migraine and fibromyalgia. Once again, I confirmed the chatbot was able to pull this information from the sources through a text prompt. However, when I generated a video, the video once again covered the same ground. It defined the difference between chronic and episodic migraine, and used the same line about migraine not being "just a really bad headache".</p>    <p>Almost halfway through the video, it eventually got to the topic of comorbidities. But then it wasted time explaining the definition of comorbidities. After three minutes, it listed the common comorbidities. Over half the video was done before it started, discussing what I had prompted: the link between chronic migraine and fibromyalgia. It briefly discussed this, then recycled information from the other videos.</p>    <p>Video overviews are still an impressive tool, but if they really want to be useful, they need to truly tweak their output to prompts, rather than recycling the same content with minimal changes.</p>    <h2>
YouTube video citations
</h2><h3>
They're lacking essential features
</h3>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p>NotebookLM does a great job of citing its answers. It also makes it easy to locate the relevant parts of documents for citations, especially text sources, by highlighting the cited information. However, for video sources, the chatbot is much less effective.</p>    <p>When you click a citation from a video source, NotebookLM opens the embedded video and its transcript. However, it doesn't provide timestamps, which makes it difficult to find the relevant part of the video. I have also noticed it highlighting the entire transcript multiple times, rather than the most relevant part. In these cases, hovering over the citation also caused the pop-up to display the entire transcript rather than a focused excerpt. I've encountered this issue across multiple notebooks, so it's not just limited to one or two cases.</p>    <p>While I mostly use text sources with NotebookLM, I first noticed this shortcoming when creating a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/using-notebooklm-for-exercise-routine/" target="_blank">customized workout routine</a> with the chatbot. It was also frustrating when using the chatbot for certain gaming guides. I imagine that if you're dealing with particularly long videos, the lack of timestamps can become especially frustrating.</p>    <h2>
The ineffective Android app
</h2><h3>
It's disappointing compared to the web version
</h3>

</div>
</div>
<p>NotebookLM is a cloud-based app, so I'd argue that mobile functionality is important. However, the mobile experience, at least what I've tried on Android, pales in comparison to the web version. Now it's worth noting that the store page notes that this is an early version of the NotebookLM app, but it has been out since May 2025, so I expected that it would be further along than it is.</p>    <p>My main gripe with the app is that while it syncs the notebooks you have saved, it doesn't sync most of your saved Studio output. I can find the occasional audio overview, but my mind maps, FAQs, and saved responses are not available in the app. I understand it not having access to some of the latest features like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/notebooklm-new-features-update/" target="_blank">quizzes and flashcards</a>, but it's frustrating when <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ways-i-use-notebooklms-mind-maps/" target="_blank">mind maps</a> and notes aren't saved either.</p>    <p>In addition, featured notebooks I've accessed out of curiosity are mixed in with my actual notebooks, with no way to remove them. Meanwhile, the source view is even more limiting because there is no way to visit the original website you have referenced.</p>    <p>The limitations of NotebookLM are essentially amplified when it comes to the mobile app.</p>    <h2>

      <![CDATA[<p>There was a time when budget CPUs felt truly special. Getting most of the performance of a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/high-end-cpu-is-overkill-now/" target="_blank">high-end CPU</a> at a fraction of the price allowed countless PC builders to get started on their PC journey. Today, however, "budget" CPUs remain so only in name. The value has been eroding every year, innovative features are only found on high-end chips, and even APUs don't offer the value they used to anymore — it increasingly feels like the budget segment is scheduled for deletion pretty soon. </p>    <h2>
Budget CPUs need a price correction

It doesn't feel budget anymore

<p>The budget CPU segment gradually switched from the 4-core CPUs of yore to modern 6-core CPUs. This was accompanied by a justified price bump, but over time, 6-core CPUs have crept up in price. The latest entrants, i.e., the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-ryzen-5-9600x-and-7-9700x-review/" target="_blank">Ryzen 5 9600X</a>, launched at an MSRP of $279 last year. Although it sold for around $200 for the bulk of its time on the market, does that really feel "budget"? Sure, you can buy last-gen 6-core chips like the Ryzen 5 7600X or <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-ryzen-5-7600-review/" target="_blank">Ryzen 5 7600</a> for less than $200, but that's a compromise. Why are companies pricing so-called budget CPUs over $200 in the first place?</p>    <p>The definition of the budget CPU segment has shifted, and consumers can't do anything about it. The days of worthwhile $150 or $120 CPUs are long gone, and will most likely never return. PC builders are rushing to build 6-core Intel and AMD systems because they don't have alternatives. They are stuck between entry-level CPUs that are too weak, and these "budget" CPUs that pack more performance than they need. Well, cheap CPUs have problems of their own.</p>

<p>The 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 9600X is a powerful processor with an efficient 65W TDP. This Zen 5 CPU has integrated graphics, DDR5 support, and a maximum boost of around 5.4GHz. It's ideal for systems where the most computing power isn't required, such as gaming rigs and general PC builds.</p>

<p>If you wish to buy a relatively new entry-level CPU, you'll only find Intel options on the market. You'll probably pick the Core i3 14100 or its F variant for around $100–$120. These chips are fine for PCs where performance isn't a priority, but due to the lack of any competition from AMD, the segment has become stale. There are no sub-$150 CPUs packing 6 cores with slightly reduced clock speeds and cache to compete with Intel's 4-core Raptor Lake SKUs. The entry-level segment has been abandoned, even by Intel, as evidenced by the Arrow Lake lineup. </p>    <p>Not everyone is building a gaming PC or professional workstation; the demand for decent, cheap CPUs is still there. If only this segment were more lively, consumers would happily forego a Ryzen 5, Core i5, or Core Ultra 5 in favor of a cheaper SKU if it met their needs. Whether this will happen in the future is highly unlikely, seeing that neither Intel nor AMD has produced any entry-level chip this generation. </p>    <h2>

<p>For those who think AMD's APUs are the saviors of the budget CPU segment, think again. APUs used to be worthwhile a few years ago when the performance justified the price. Instead of buying a CPU and a discrete GPU, you could realistically build a half-decent 1080p gaming PC with a single APU. Today, however, both the prices of AMD's APUs and the standards of modern 1080p gaming have climbed to a whole new level. The performance that the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-ryzen-5-8600g-review/" target="_blank">Ryzen 5 8600G</a> or <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-ryzen-7-8700g-review/" target="_blank">Ryzen 7 8700G</a> promises to a budget buyer isn't that attractive anymore.</p>    <p>Both of these are Zen 4 chips that were passable for 1080p gaming in 2024. Over a year after launch, the value proposition has dipped further. They're priced at around $200 and $270, respectively, which might appear a great deal on the surface. After all, you're saving the cost of a discrete GPU. If you consider the onboard GPU capabilities, however, you'll soon realize that even the ancient RX 580 (which retails for about $100) can handily beat the Ryzen 5 8700G in GPU performance. You can make a solid case for skipping the stunted CPU and weak GPU on AMD's most powerful APU in favor of a more powerful build with a $200 Zen 5 CPU and a $100 discrete graphics card. </p>

<p>AMD's Ryzen 7 8700G is a powerful APU with integrated processing and graphics, negating the need for a discrete GPU. It's powerful enough for 1080p gaming.</p>

<p>Another thing I'm miffed about is the lack of truly innovative features on budget CPUs. For instance, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/heres-why-amds-cpus-are-better-than-intels-for-gaming/" target="_blank">AMD's 3D V-Cache</a> is mostly reserved for its high-end chips priced at $450 or higher. Even when the company offered the Ryzen 5 5600X3D or the Ryzen 5 7600X3D, the former was a delayed launch, and the latter was priced too high to be called a budget CPU anymore. The rumored Ryzen 5 9600X3D might appear soon, but there's little chance that AMD will price it lower than $300 (at least).</p>    <p>I understand that CPU manufacturers need to keep segmentation in mind just like anyone else, but the pricing of these budget X3D CPUs doesn't make sense even then. At this point, the budget CPU segment needs a revival, whether that comes in the form of price cuts or feature additions (without absurd price hikes). New and game-changing technologies ought to trickle down to the lowest-tier products after multiple generations. </p>    <h3>
The budget CPU died a silent death
</h3>
<p>It feels like CPU manufacturers sneakily killed the budget CPU without most people noticing anything. Today, we don't have sub-$200 CPUs worth getting excited about. Most of the best features are reserved for high-end chips, and even APUs don't offer the value they once did. The budget CPU segment has disappeared in all but name. </p>]]>

<p>Another thing I'm miffed about is the lack of truly innovative features on budget CPUs. For instance, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/heres-why-amds-cpus-are-better-than-intels-for-gaming/" target="_blank">AMD's 3D V-Cache</a> is mostly reserved for its high-end chips priced at $450 or higher. Even when the company offered the Ryzen 5 5600X3D or the Ryzen 5 7600X3D, the former was a delayed launch, and the latter was priced too high to be called a budget CPU anymore. The rumored Ryzen 5 9600X3D might appear soon, but there's little chance that AMD will price it lower than $300 (at least).</p>    <p>I understand that CPU manufacturers need to keep segmentation in mind just like anyone else, but the pricing of these budget X3D CPUs doesn't make sense even then. At this point, the budget CPU segment needs a revival, whether that comes in the form of price cuts or feature additions (without absurd price hikes). New and game-changing technologies ought to trickle down to the lowest-tier products after multiple generations. </p>    <h3>
The budget CPU died a silent death
</h3>
<p>It feels like CPU manufacturers sneakily killed the budget CPU without most people noticing anything. Today, we don't have sub-$200 CPUs worth getting excited about. Most of the best features are reserved for high-end chips, and even APUs don't offer the value they once did. The budget CPU segment has disappeared in all but name. </p>]]>
    </description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a time when budget CPUs felt truly special. Getting most of the performance of a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/high-end-cpu-is-overkill-now/" target="_blank">high-end CPU</a> at a fraction of the price allowed countless PC builders to get started on their PC journey. Today, however, "budget" CPUs remain so only in name. The value has been eroding every year, innovative features are only found on high-end chips, and even APUs don't offer the value they used to anymore — it increasingly feels like the budget segment is scheduled for deletion pretty soon. </p>    <h2>
Budget CPUs need a price correction
</h2><h3>
It doesn't feel budget anymore
</h3>

<p>The budget CPU segment gradually switched from the 4-core CPUs of yore to modern 6-core CPUs. This was accompanied by a justified price bump, but over time, 6-core CPUs have crept up in price. The latest entrants, i.e., the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-ryzen-5-9600x-and-7-9700x-review/" target="_blank">Ryzen 5 9600X</a>, launched at an MSRP of $279 last year. Although it sold for around $200 for the bulk of its time on the market, does that really feel "budget"? Sure, you can buy last-gen 6-core chips like the Ryzen 5 7600X or <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-ryzen-5-7600-review/" target="_blank">Ryzen 5 7600</a> for less than $200, but that's a compromise. Why are companies pricing so-called budget CPUs over $200 in the first place?</p>    <p>The definition of the budget CPU segment has shifted, and consumers can't do anything about it. The days of worthwhile $150 or $120 CPUs are long gone, and will most likely never return. PC builders are rushing to build 6-core Intel and AMD systems because they don't have alternatives. They are stuck between entry-level CPUs that are too weak, and these "budget" CPUs that pack more performance than they need. Well, cheap CPUs have problems of their own.</p>

<p>The 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 9600X is a powerful processor with an efficient 65W TDP. This Zen 5 CPU has integrated graphics, DDR5 support, and a maximum boost of around 5.4GHz. It's ideal for systems where the most computing power isn't required, such as gaming rigs and general PC builds.</p>

<h2>
The entry-level segment has no competition
</h2><h3>
Intel's the only option

<p>If you wish to buy a relatively new entry-level CPU, you'll only find Intel options on the market. You'll probably pick the Core i3 14100 or its F variant for around $100–$120. These chips are fine for PCs where performance isn't a priority, but due to the lack of any competition from AMD, the segment has become stale. There are no sub-$150 CPUs packing 6 cores with slightly reduced clock speeds and cache to compete with Intel's 4-core Raptor Lake SKUs. The entry-level segment has been abandoned, even by Intel, as evidenced by the Arrow Lake lineup. </p>    <p>Not everyone is building a gaming PC or professional workstation; the demand for decent, cheap CPUs is still there. If only this segment were more lively, consumers would happily forego a Ryzen 5, Core i5, or Core Ultra 5 in favor of a cheaper SKU if it met their needs. Whether this will happen in the future is highly unlikely, seeing that neither Intel nor AMD has produced any entry-level chip this generation. </p>    <h2>
APUs are not "value" chips anymore
</h2>

</div>
<p>For those who think AMD's APUs are the saviors of the budget CPU segment, think again. APUs used to be worthwhile a few years ago when the performance justified the price. Instead of buying a CPU and a discrete GPU, you could realistically build a half-decent 1080p gaming PC with a single APU. Today, however, both the prices of AMD's APUs and the standards of modern 1080p gaming have climbed to a whole new level. The performance that the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-ryzen-5-8600g-review/" target="_blank">Ryzen 5 8600G</a> or <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-ryzen-7-8700g-review/" target="_blank">Ryzen 7 8700G</a> promises to a budget buyer isn't that attractive anymore.</p>    <p>Both of these are Zen 4 chips that were passable for 1080p gaming in 2024. Over a year after launch, the value proposition has dipped further. They're priced at around $200 and $270, respectively, which might appear a great deal on the surface. After all, you're saving the cost of a discrete GPU. If you consider the onboard GPU capabilities, however, you'll soon realize that even the ancient RX 580 (which retails for about $100) can handily beat the Ryzen 5 8700G in GPU performance. You can make a solid case for skipping the stunted CPU and weak GPU on AMD's most powerful APU in favor of a more powerful build with a $200 Zen 5 CPU and a $100 discrete graphics card. </p>

      <![CDATA[<p>When I first started building my smart home, I did what most people do: I bought a bunch of off-the-shelf smart devices, installed their apps, and connected them to my network. Some of them I've had for years, but as time went on, I realized I don't truly "own" these devices. From lights to smart plugs and even     <span><a href="/replaced-smart-speakers-cheaper-open-source-alternatives/" target="_blank">voice assistants</a></span>, I endeavored to replace them with my own alternatives... or at the very least, take back control of them.    </p>    <p>You see, between closed-off ecosystems, cloud dependenices, and even subscription paywalls, the limitations of the hardware I "own" became grating. I've opted to skip most of those off-the-shelf options, unless they can be taken offline somehow, so that my smart home is <em>truly</em> mine. Without the requirement to contact servers halfway across the world or even have an internet connection.</p>    <h2>
The ESP32 and Zigbee were what made it click
</h2><h3>
It was a slow descent
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Sonoff-Zigbee-USB-Dongle-Plus-Coordinator" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/07/sonoff-zigbee-usb-dongle-plus-coordinator.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>The first ever smart home device that I purchased with my new-found focus on <em>owning </em>my smart home was a     <span><a href="/i-finally-set-home-assistant-zigbee-home-changed/" target="_blank">Zigbee</a></span> coordinator, alongside a pair of temperature and humidity reporters. These are simple gadgets with a multi-year battery life, and they just <em>work</em>. They report data back to a machine with the Zigbee coordinator connected running Zigbee2MQTT, and nothing ever leaves my network. It's basic, but soon I had door sensors, air quality monitors, and even a fingerbot.    </p>    <p>Shortly after, I discovered the ESP32. A Wi-Fi and Bluetooth powerhouse found for just a few dollars, I messaged my colleague, Ayush Pande, in order to get a headstart on what I needed to get started with them and figure out how they work. The thing is, the ESP32 is already the basis of many smart home devices, so there's already an established use case, and it means <em>you</em> control the firmware, rather than the manufacturer.</p>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="ESP32 connected to a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/07/esp32-smart-home-sensors-temperature-sensor.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>I experimented with many different setups at first, and I replicated my Zigbee temperature and humidity sensor with an ESP32 and a DHT11, before building other devices, too. These included motion sensors, small LCD screens, vibration sensors, and so much more. These tiny projects were a lot of fun, addictive, and made me realize just how easy it was to build basic hardware for cheap, with full control, and no requirement for even an outbound internet connection. </p>    <p>In my research, I discovered that many smart lights have an ESP8266 or even an ESP32 inside. I had Tuya smart lights, and while I can certainly use tools like tuya-convert to reflash them and cut them from the cloud for good, I can also use local Home Assistant integrations (such as Tuya Local) to send commands to them over my network.

<p>Once I was comfortable with ESPHome and development on the ESP32, the possibilities felt endless. I'm genuinely proud of the devices that I've built, and they fulfill use cases that suit me specifically rather than a generic device purchased off the shelf.

      <![CDATA[<p>When I first started building my smart home, I did what most people do: I bought a bunch of off-the-shelf smart devices, installed their apps, and connected them to my network.

      <![CDATA[<p>I love my MacBook Air for its portability and long battery life, but when I need serious work done, I know it's far from the most powerful computer. For that, I depend on my powerful Mac Studio. But, obviously, I can't travel with a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-know-before-switching-mac/" target="_blank">Mac Studio</a>. It's likely you've run into the same issue as me. Sitting at a cafe, or even in another country, you might want to access your home computer. Except, setting it up properly for remote access is an exercise in frustration, dealing with routers, ports, and VPNs. Sure, <span>tools like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/rustdesk-is-more-powerful-than-initially-estimated/" target="_blank">RustDesk</a></span>have made remote desktop access simpler and more privacy-friendly. But it's not the only game in town. Lately, I've been using another self-hosted remote desktop tool called Getscreen.me, and it takes everything good about RustDesk and makes it even more polished and accessible.</p>    <p>At first glance, <a href="https://getscreen.me/" target="_blank">Getscreen.me</a> isn't fundamentally different from other remote access tools. It lets you connect to your PC for whatever you need to do, or even access another computer for troubleshooting. Straightforward. But what sets it apart from other remote desktop tools is how effortless it is to set up. Moreover, unlike most other remote desktop tools, it requires no client to access. You can literally get it up and running from your browser, which makes it extremely powerful.</p>    <p>Instead of fussing with IP addresses, port forwarding, or even usernames and passwords, you just have to open your browser, enter the provided URL, and head straight to your remote screen in seconds. That browser-based approach means the software works seamlessly across desktop and smartphone platforms.</p>    <h2>
Refreshingly simple setup
</h2><h3>
How it works behind the scenes
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-109922934" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-109922934" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-109922934" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-109922934" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-109922934-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the key aspects of a well-designed piece of software is how easy or hard it makes it to get started. With GetScreen.me, the set-up is laughably easy. You visit the website, download the client, install it, generate a link, and share it. That's it. As soon as you click the links, the agent runs in the background, and that's it, you can now see your screen. You don't need to install anything, nor do you have to create an account for one-time logins if you're just sharing your screen with a friend. It's really that simple.</p>    <p>If you're curious about how the app works, I've got you covered. GetScreen.me relies on WebRTC and secure tunneling to power its ultra-fast remote desktop experience. It's the same technology behind video calls, which means connections happen in real time with little to no lag and without exposing your IP address publicly.</p>    <p>Another aspect I really like about GetScreen.me is that you can install it as a permanent <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-why-custom-ai-agent-better-than-chatgpt/" target="_blank">agent</a>. If you've created an account, setting up the permanent agent registers your device in the account. From there, you can log in from any browser or the web dashboard and take control of your home server from anywhere. It even supports multiple monitors, session recording, and, most importantly for me, file transfers. All of that works without mucking around with configuration files or worrying about NAT traversal. It's extremely seamless.</p>    <p>Finally, when it comes to an app like this, security is important. GetScreen.me supports essential features such as <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-built-self-hosted-2fa-server/" target="_blank">two-factor authentication</a>, encrypted communication, and fine-grained control over who can access what on your system. GetScreen.me isn't fully self-hosted in the sense that you can bypass the company's infrastructure entirely. However, a fully self-hosted version is available for business use cases. That option gives you the same browser-based convenience, except it runs entirely on your own infrastructure. That option makes the tool invaluable to small businesses.</p>    <h2>
How I use GetScreen.me in everyday scenarios
</h2><h3>
Quick fixes, grabbing files, and remote troubleshooting
</h3>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p> So you might be wondering how I use GetScreen.me in my use cases. The short answer is, almost everywhere.

      <![CDATA[<p>I love my MacBook Air for its portability and long battery life, but when I need serious work done, I know it's far from the most powerful computer. For that, I depend on my powerful Mac Studio. But, obviously, I can't travel with a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-know-before-switching-mac/" target="_blank">Mac Studio</a>. It's likely you've run into the same issue as me. Sitting at a cafe, or even in another country, you might want to access your home computer. Except, setting it up properly for remote access is an exercise in frustration, dealing with routers, ports, and VPNs. Sure, <span>tools like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/rustdesk-is-more-powerful-than-initially-estimated/" target="_blank">RustDesk</a></span>have made remote desktop access simpler and more privacy-friendly. But it's not the only game in town. Lately, I've been using another self-hosted remote desktop tool called Getscreen.me, and it takes everything good about RustDesk and makes it even more polished and accessible.</p>    <p>At first glance, <a href="https://getscreen.me/" target="_blank">Getscreen.me</a> isn't fundamentally different from other remote access tools. It lets you connect to your PC for whatever you need to do, or even access another computer for troubleshooting. Straightforward. But what sets it apart from other remote desktop tools is how effortless it is to set up. Moreover, unlike most other remote desktop tools, it requires no client to access. You can literally get it up and running from your browser, which makes it extremely powerful.</p>    <p>Instead of fussing with IP addresses, port forwarding, or even usernames and passwords, you just have to open your browser, enter the provided URL, and head straight to your remote screen in seconds. That browser-based approach means the software works seamlessly across desktop and smartphone platforms.</p>    <h2>
Refreshingly simple setup
</h2><h3>
How it works behind the scenes
</h3>

<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-109922934" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-109922934" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-109922934" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-109922934" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-109922934-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the key aspects of a well-designed piece of software is how easy or hard it makes it to get started. With GetScreen.me, the set-up is laughably easy. You visit the website, download the client, install it, generate a link, and share it. That's it. As soon as you click the links, the agent runs in the background, and that's it, you can now see your screen. You don't need to install anything, nor do you have to create an account for one-time logins if you're just sharing your screen with a friend. It's really that simple.</p>    <p>If you're curious about how the app works, I've got you covered. GetScreen.me relies on WebRTC and secure tunneling to power its ultra-fast remote desktop experience. It's the same technology behind video calls, which means connections happen in real time with little to no lag and without exposing your IP address publicly.</p>    <p>Another aspect I really like about GetScreen.me is that you can install it as a permanent <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-why-custom-ai-agent-better-than-chatgpt/" target="_blank">agent</a>. If you've created an account, setting up the permanent agent registers your device in the account. From there, you can log in from any browser or the web dashboard and take control of your home server from anywhere. It even supports multiple monitors, session recording, and, most importantly for me, file transfers. All of that works without mucking around with configuration files or worrying about NAT traversal. It's extremely seamless.</p>    <p>Finally, when it comes to an app like this, security is important. GetScreen.me supports essential features such as <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-built-self-hosted-2fa-server/" target="_blank">two-factor authentication</a>, encrypted communication, and fine-grained control over who can access what on your system. GetScreen.me isn't fully self-hosted in the sense that you can bypass the company's infrastructure entirely. However, a fully self-hosted version is available for business use cases. That option gives you the same browser-based convenience, except it runs entirely on your own infrastructure. That option makes the tool invaluable to small businesses.</p>    <h2>

      <![CDATA[<p>What's better than a party game? A party game you can play both online <em>and</em> locally, of course. No matter if your friends are on your sofa or are "so-fa" away from you, you can still play a round whenever you like.</p>    <p>Well, if you're hankering for a new way to test your friendship, why not give Ultimate Chicken Horse a try? Not only is it a blast with your friends, but it's currently 65% off on Steam, bringing the price down to an impressive $5.24.</p>    <h2>
Why Ultimate Chicken Horse is a great pick for you and your friends
</h2>
<p>So here's the premise for Ultimate Chicken Horse. Once you and your friends have been assigned a woodland creature to play as, you begin building a stage. The goal is to go from the start to the flag. Sounds easy? Well, yes, it is; that's why it's your job to lay traps along the path.</p>    <p><span>You may be tempted to make the stage impossible to beat, but the rub is that <em>you</em> also have to play and complete the level. If everyone falls prey to traps, nobody scores a point. Similarly, if <em>nobody</em> perishes, nobody scores a point. You have to strike a precise balance where it's just easy enough that you can beat it, but hard enough that nobody else can. And once you figure out the perfect solution, you have to protect your design from your annoyed friends, as they do everything in their power to ruin your setup.Here's how the devs describe the game:</span></p>    <blockquote>
<p>Ever wish you were a wall-jumping, arrow-dodging, trap-setting horse, besting your animal pals in a race through a peril-laden obstacle course that you all built together?</p>
<p>Wish Granted!</p>
<p>Ultimate Chicken Horse is a party platformer where you and your friends build the level as you play, placing deadly traps before trying to reach the end of the level. If you can make it but your friends can't, you score points! Play online or locally with your animal buddies and experiment with a wide variety of platforms in all sorts of strange locations to find new ways to mess with your friends.</p>
</blockquote><p>Ultimate Chicken Horse is currently 65% off on Steam for $5.29. As I <span>mentioned earlier, it features both couch co-op and online play modes for friends of all distances; however, it <em>also</em> supports crossplay, allowing you to play with friends who already own it on a different console</span>. Be sure to snag it before the deal expires on October 20th, and check out <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pc-games-perfect-play-lan-party/" target="_blank">these other PC games that are perfect to play at a LAN party</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>What's better than a party game? A party game you can play both online <em>and</em> locally, of course. No matter if your friends are on your sofa or are "so-fa" away from you, you can still play a round whenever you like.</p>    <p>Well, if you're hankering for a new way to test your friendship, why not give Ultimate Chicken Horse a try? Not only is it a blast with your friends, but it's currently 65% off on Steam, bringing the price down to an impressive $5.24.</p>    <h2>
Why Ultimate Chicken Horse is a great pick for you and your friends
</h2>
<p>So here's the premise for Ultimate Chicken Horse. Once you and your friends have been assigned a woodland creature to play as, you begin building a stage. The goal is to go from the start to the flag. Sounds easy? Well, yes, it is; that's why it's your job to lay traps along the path.</p>    <p><span>You may be tempted to make the stage impossible to beat, but the rub is that <em>you</em> also have to play and complete the level. If everyone falls prey to traps, nobody scores a point. Similarly, if <em>nobody</em> perishes, nobody scores a point. You have to strike a precise balance where it's just easy enough that you can beat it, but hard enough that nobody else can. And once you figure out the perfect solution, you have to protect your design from your annoyed friends, as they do everything in their power to ruin your setup.Here's how the devs describe the game:</span></p>    <blockquote>
<p>Ever wish you were a wall-jumping, arrow-dodging, trap-setting horse, besting your animal pals in a race through a peril-laden obstacle course that you all built together?</p>
<p>Wish Granted!</p>
<p>Ultimate Chicken Horse is a party platformer where you and your friends build the level as you play, placing deadly traps before trying to reach the end of the level. If you can make it but your friends can't, you score points! Play online or locally with your animal buddies and experiment with a wide variety of platforms in all sorts of strange locations to find new ways to mess with your friends.</p>
</blockquote><p>Ultimate Chicken Horse is currently 65% off on Steam for $5.29. As I <span>mentioned earlier, it features both couch co-op and online play modes for friends of all distances; however, it <em>also</em> supports crossplay, allowing you to play with friends who already own it on a different console</span>. Be sure to snag it before the deal expires on October 20th, and check out <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pc-games-perfect-play-lan-party/" target="_blank">these other PC games that are perfect to play at a LAN party</a>.</p>

Not only is it a blast with your friends, but it's currently 65% off on Steam, bringing the price down to an impressive $5.24.</p>    <h2>
Why Ultimate Chicken Horse is a great pick for you and your friends
</h2>
<p>So here's the premise for Ultimate Chicken Horse. Once you and your friends have been assigned a woodland creature to play as, you begin building a stage. The goal is to go from the start to the flag. Sounds easy? Well, yes, it is; that's why it's your job to lay traps along the path.</p>    <p><span>You may be tempted to make the stage impossible to beat, but the rub is that <em>you</em> also have to play and complete the level. If everyone falls prey to traps, nobody scores a point. Similarly, if <em>nobody</em> perishes, nobody scores a point. You have to strike a precise balance where it's just easy enough that you can beat it, but hard enough that nobody else can. And once you figure out the perfect solution, you have to protect your design from your annoyed friends, as they do everything in their power to ruin your setup.Here's how the devs describe the game:</span></p>    <blockquote>
<p>Ever wish you were a wall-jumping, arrow-dodging, trap-setting horse, besting your animal pals in a race through a peril-laden obstacle course that you all built together?</p>
<p>Wish Granted!</p>
<p>Ultimate Chicken Horse is a party platformer where you and your friends build the level as you play, placing deadly traps before trying to reach the end of the level. If you can make it but your friends can't, you score points! Play online or locally with your animal buddies and experiment with a wide variety of platforms in all sorts of strange locations to find new ways to mess with your friends.</p>
</blockquote><p>Ultimate Chicken Horse is currently 65% off on Steam for $5.29. As I <span>mentioned earlier, it features both couch co-op and online play modes for friends of all distances; however, it <em>also</em> supports crossplay, allowing you to play with friends who already own it on a different console</span>. Be sure to snag it before the deal expires on October 20th, and check out <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pc-games-perfect-play-lan-party/" target="_blank">these other PC games that are perfect to play at a LAN party</a>.</p>
