      <![CDATA[<p>I’ve always been a tad bit embarrassed admitting this, especially as someone who writes about tech for a living and is also majoring in computer science, but I have absolutely no idea how self-hosting works. Sure, I know what it means, but I've never really properly self-hosted anything before. Even when I have, I’ve just blindly followed a YouTube tutorial step by step, copying commands without really understanding what any of them did.</p>    <p>Recently, I've been hearing more and more people talk about <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-started-self-hosting-llms-absolutely-loved-it/" target="_blank">running Large Language Models (LLMs) locally on their devices and loving it</a>, which is essentially "self-hosting" your own AI. Even without knowing too much about the self-hosting world, I still understand the benefits that come with it: much faster performance, complete privacy, and no need for an internet connection every time you want to use it.</p>    <p>At the same time, I’m too intimidated to even know where to start. Every guide I’ve come across throws around technical terms like containers, models, and APIs as if everyone already knows what they mean (and I clearly don’t). So, I decided to turn to the tool I use whenever I need to study something I’m unfamiliar with: NotebookLM — to help me figure out all this self-hosting-an-LLM stuff.</p>    <h2>
Why NotebookLM felt like the right tool for this
</h2><h3>
It’ll guide you step by step

</div>
</div>
<p>Nowadays, when you don't really know how to do something (technical or not), the best course of action is typically to turn to an AI chatbot. Like most people, my first instinct when I wasn’t sure how to go about self-hosting was to ask ChatGPT and Perplexity, and both had pretty much the same approach. They threw a bunch of information at me, compiled from various sources across the web and their own training data.</p>    <p>For instance, ChatGPT started off with the different setup types (local-only or server-based), and then mentioned that the next step was to install a “local runner” like Ollama, which it described as the easiest. It gave me various methods to run an LLM and even included optional steps if I wanted a web interface like ChatGPT. ChatGPT’s response included terminal commands and recommendations for compatible models. It felt like it had merged different guides and approaches into one massive, dense answer.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>While I’m sure the information was certainly useful, it was way too overwhelming. I instantly knew that using an AI chatbot alone wasn’t the best approach here. A YouTube video could help, but I wouldn’t really be able to ask follow-up questions or get clarifications on the parts I didn’t understand. I realized there was only one tool that could help me here: NotebookLM. With it, I could still benefit from AI guidance, yet have much more control over the pace and structure of my learning.</p>    <p>The biggest benefit was that I could hand-pick the sources I wanted NotebookLM to reference to help me learn how to set up a self-hosted LLM. I managed to find a couple of guides online and YouTube videos, and uploaded them as sources to a new NotebookLM notebook.</p>

<p>I also added a relevant XDA article, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-wish-knew-started-self-host-llms/" target="_blank">7 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Self-Hosting LLMs</a>, since I thought it would give me practical tips from someone who had already been through the process.</p>    <p>Once you add sources to a NotebookLM notebook, any responses you get are directly grounded in the material you’ve provided. The responses also include clickable citations, and hovering over them shows exactly where NotebookLM pulled the information from your sources, which made it incredibly easy to cross-reference and verify everything.</p>    <h2>

<p><span>Once I had uploaded my sources to a NotebookLM notebook, the next step was beginning the learning process. Whenever I want to learn something new with NotebookLM's help, I don't usually turn to any of its learning tools like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-impressed-notebooklm-audio-overviews/" target="_blank">Audio Overviews</a> or<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/notebooklm-generate-mind-maps/" target="_blank"> Mind Maps</a>.The very first thing I do to acquaint myself with the sources is use the <strong>Chat</strong> panel to ask questions I may have. Often, I simply ask it to summarize the entire source. In this case, I already knew I wouldn't have to use the other learning tools, as my aim here was simply to learn how to set the LLM up. So, I typed in a prompt where I explained my level of knowledge, outlining that I was a complete beginner with no prior experience in self-hosting. I asked NotebookLM to guide me step by step, using the sources I had uploaded, and to explain any technical terms in simple, easy-to-understand language. Here's the exact prompt I used:</span></p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p><span>I have absolutely no idea what self-hosting is or how to set up a self-hosted LLM. Can you walk me through how I can set up a local LLM on my Mac? Assume I’m a complete beginner and don’t know any technical jargon. I don’t want theory. I want to understand what tools or steps are actually involved, but explained simply.</span></p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p><span>A couple of days ago, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/notebooklm-learning-guide-feature/" target="_blank">NotebookLM launched a new Learning Guide Chat</a> mode, as well as the option to create your own conversational style mode. Since my goal here was to learn how to do something, I chose the Learning Guide mode, as it's designed to guide you through complex topics in a structured, step-by-step way. It also takes your current knowledge level into account, adjusting explanations so that even beginners can follow along without getting lost.NotebookLM first began by explaining what self-hosting actually is, especially in the context of LLMs. It explained the benefits, and then, based on my complete beginner status, mentioned that my sources strongly suggested starting with LM Studio. It then briefly outlined the steps and asked me to confirm if I was ready to jump into them. NotebookLM guided me through each step with incredibly detailed instructions.</span></p>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1543125476" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1543125476" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1543125476" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1543125476" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1543125476-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p><span>In each response, it focused on only one step and proceeded to the next only when I confirmed I was ready, which made the learning process feel manageable and well-paced. I performed the tasks right alongside it and asked any questions I had as I set up. NotebookLM helped sort out my queries instantly by referencing the sources I had uploaded.For instance, LM Studio automatically began installing a recommended model, and NotebookLM helped me figure out if it was a good fit for my needs and whether I should proceed with it or try a different option. Minutes later, my first local AI model was up and running. I then spent some time exploring its interface and testing basic prompts to make sure everything was working correctly (it was).</span></p>    <h3>
I had no doubts about how helpful NotebookLM would be
</h3>
<p>I've been using NotebookLM since it was a mere Google Labs experiment, and it's yet to let me down. I know it's the best tool to turn to when learning something new, especially when the topic seems too complex to tackle alone. I'm glad I finally decided to do this, and now I have a self-hosted LLM up and running.</p>]]>

<p><span>In each response, it focused on only one step and proceeded to the next only when I confirmed I was ready, which made the learning process feel manageable and well-paced. I performed the tasks right alongside it and asked any questions I had as I set up. NotebookLM helped sort out my queries instantly by referencing the sources I had uploaded.For instance, LM Studio automatically began installing a recommended model, and NotebookLM helped me figure out if it was a good fit for my needs and whether I should proceed with it or try a different option. Minutes later, my first local AI model was up and running. I then spent some time exploring its interface and testing basic prompts to make sure everything was working correctly (it was).</span></p>    <h3>
I had no doubts about how helpful NotebookLM would be
</h3>
<p>I've been using NotebookLM since it was a mere Google Labs experiment, and it's yet to let me down. I know it's the best tool to turn to when learning something new, especially when the topic seems too complex to tackle alone. I'm glad I finally decided to do this, and now I have a self-hosted LLM up and running.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>The era of ultralight laptops is great for those who only need basic computing tasks, but for anything more strenuous, they fall flat. And that's where <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-workstation-laptops/" target="_blank">workstation laptops come in</a>. These powerful machines are designed to be desktop replacements but portable, so that scientists, engineers, developers, and anyone with the need for speed can get their work done in the field, whenever needed.</p>    <p>And that's what we've got on the test bench today. The HP ZBook X G1i is a 16-inch mobile workstation with Pro-level Nvidia discrete graphics, plenty of storage and memory, and a powerful CPU to chew through data analysis or AI tasks. It's the kind of machine that's honestly not made for everyone, but if you know you need the power it contains, it should have no substitute. This model is (almost) the top spec, with everything maxed out except that the display is the 2K version and not the 4K, but with added extras like 5G connectivity, you might be too busy to notice the pixel count.</p>    <p>It's the kind of laptop that can crunch numbers for <em>science</em>, or train AI models without needing a data center's power. Or, it would be, if the discrete Nvidia GPU had more than 8GB of VRAM to use. AI models benefit when they can be entirely stored in VRAM along with the data from the token window, and this simply isn't enough memory for the types of workloads that the power user who would usually buy this laptop would need.</p>    <p><em><strong>About this review:</strong> HP loaned me the ZBook X G1i for the purposes of this review. The company had no input in its content.</em></p>

<p>The HP ZBook X G1i is a true mobile workstation replacement, able to handle heavy computing tasks while away from a desk. It's not the most value-oriented model, but that's a secondary consideration when professional projects hinge on whether the tools are up to the task at hand.</p>

<h2>
HP ZBook X G1i: Pricing and availability
</h2><h3>
Workstations don't come cheap
</h3>
<p>The HP ZBook X G1i was announced in March 2025, with an MSRP that starts from $3,401. Yes, that's the price of the lowest-tier model, with an Intel Core Ultra 5 225H CPU. That said, HP has a model with the Intel Core Ultra 5 235H, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD for $1,929 right now, so it's clear that pricing is predictably all over the place, as always when dealing with the non-standard models that aren't made for the general consumer market.</p>    <p>You can go up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H CPU and Nvidia RTX Pro 2000 mobile GPU, a tier above the model we're reviewing, and likely to be over $6,000 all-in. Mobile workstations are never "cheap," but when you know you need that power, that's the only consideration that matters.</p>

This is a seriously slim mobile workstation

Plenty of power hides under those sleek lines

<p>While many 16-inch laptops could be treated as desktop replacements, only mobile workstations like this model really fit the bill. It's not just the power and portability; it's things like ISV qualifications, so the industry-standard software the professionals rely on has been tested to work reliably with this laptop. Things like CAD software, or physics modeling, and of course, AI models and their training.</p>    <p>And with that in mind, it's surprising to me that HP has put all that power under such a slimline chassis that is entirely aluminum and isn't that much thicker than the PowerPoint-pushing clamshells that are usually on my desk. It's got two USB-A ports, HDMI 2.1, an audio jack, and two Thunderbolt 4 ports, alongside an SD card reader, a smart card reader for those of you with device unlock policies that need one, and a SIM slot to take advantage of the sub-6GHz 5G modem that's onboard. Oh, and a fold-down 1GbE LAN port because, while it has Wi-Fi 7, nothing's as     <span><a href="/lessons-from-upgrading-to-home-network-prosumer-gear/" target="_blank">stable as wired connectivity</a></span>.    </p>

</div>
</section><p>Make no bones about it, this is a laptop you'll want to use, not because you spend exorbitant amounts of money on it, but because it's gorgeous to touch. The aluminum has a soft-touch texture that's grippy while feeling premium. There is zero flex anywhere when typing or holding it up with one hand, and you can tell that it's built to survive heavy workloads in situations that might not be anywhere near a desk.</p>    <h2>
The display is pretty nice too
</h2><h3>
And it's not even the top tier 4K model
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="hp zbook x g1i workstation" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/hp-zbook-x-g1i-screen.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>This model has the display one down from the ultra-premium 4K panel, but the 16-inch, 2.5K (2560x1600) IPS panel is no slouch. It's got a 120Hz refresh rate with dynamic refresh rate in Windows, anti-glare coating, and 400 nits of brightness. It's on the better end of panels that I've used this year without being OLED, and going with the hardier IPS is honestly the right play for a workstation anyway.</p>    <p>After testing with the Datacolor SpyderPro, I found this panel pretty good. It covers 100% sRGB, 98% AdobeRGB, 99% P3, and 96% NTSC, outperforming many of the consumer OLED panels I've used. It peaks at 458.7 nits of brightness, which is good, but only when the backlight is set to 100%.</p>    <p>It falls off sharply when you reduce the backlight to save power, and it's only 208.6 nits at 75% brightness, 109.5 nits at 50%, and 57 nits at 25% brightness. This makes it hard to use at anything but the highest brightness level, although 50% is close to the suggested target when doing color-accurate design work.</p>    <p>Adding to that is a disappointing 2.34 deltaE average color accuracy value. I don't like doing color work on anything above 2.0 deltaE away from expected color, and I'm sure many (most?) digital designers will agree. The luminance uniformity is even more scattered, and this is not the panel quality you'd expect from this laptop class in 2025.</p>    <h2>
We're used to Arrow Lake Mobile

But the Nvidia RTX Pro 2000 GPU makes things (a little) more interesting

</div>
<p>I'm not sure exactly what performance figures I was expecting, but for a laptop that costs just shy of 6 grand, I was underwhelmed. It's true this is the Core Ultra 7 model and not the Core Ultra 9, but I expected more from the Nvidia RTX Pro 2000. Maybe the lack of GDDR7 VRAM (only 8GB) was the reason, but regardless of the Windows power profile, or if the laptop was plugged in, the results were very similar.</p>    <p>It feels like HP intentionally limits the power available in order to keep thermals in check, because at no point during my testing did the top of the keyboard get warm. Is that the behavior you'd want from a mobile workstation? I'm not so sure, and I'd prefer more power, slightly toastier fingertips while typing.</p>    <div>

<p>But benchmarks are only part of the story. Like last year's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/hp-zbook-studio-g11-review/" target="_blank">ZBook Studio 16 G11</a>, the ZBook X G1i is a mixed bag in real-world usage. The occasional stutter when browsing or working on large documents is fine, really, and could be Windows being Windows. But it was so frisky when downloading updates or new programs, far more so than my significantly more powerful desktop PC. And trying to charge via the Thunderbolt 4 ports would always throw a "this charger isn't powerful enough" error, even when using a dock that matches the 150W power brick the workstation comes with.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>In this realm, value takes a backseat to the simple equation of "can it do the task or not," and in that calculus, the HP ZBook X G1i is very good indeed.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Mobile workstations aren't known for their battery life, but this year, mobile chips are designed to be powerful and efficient. We ran the ZBook X G1i through the Procyon Productivity Test, and it tapped out after 4 hours and 23 minutes. That's the worst performer I've used <em>all year,</em> and I can't even blame it on the Blackwell discrete GPU. It's not quite as bad as gaming laptops, but it's time to rethink your priorities when your other choice as a creative professional is a MacBook Pro that can outlast by several times that number.</p>    <h2>
Should you buy the HP ZBook X G1i?
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="hp zbook x g1i open as far as it wil go" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/hp-zbook-x-g1i-flat.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>You SHOULD buy the HP ZBook X G1i if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
<strong>You need a mobile workstation, and cost is no object</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>You don't want a thick, noisy laptop</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>You need to run Windows-only programs</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You SHOULD NOT buy the HP ZBook X G1i if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
<strong>You want to play games on your laptop as well</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Your work isn't footing the bill</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>You need a long battery life</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The HP ZBook X G1i is a seriously svelte and superbly powerful mobile workstation. On the higher-end models, like the one reviewed, it's got the chops to chew through complex calculations, 3D modeling, and anything else you could dream up. But if you can't afford to crank the sliders up to the top, it's no different from most consumer laptops, except the price tag is twice what you'd expect to pay for a comparable Arrow Lake mobile clamshell with no discrete GPU.</p>

</section><p>That said, anyone needing a mobile workstation won't be settling for second-best, which means speccing it out to the nines. In this realm, value takes a backseat to the simple equation of "can it do the task or not," and in that calculus, the HP ZBook X G1i is very good indeed. The only question mark is over the 8GB of VRAM on the discrete GPU, because while it's enough for video editing or other creative tasks, it's nowhere near enough to deal with many of the AI models that you might want to use in the field.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>The era of ultralight laptops is great for those who only need basic computing tasks, but for anything more strenuous, they fall flat. And that's where <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-workstation-laptops/" target="_blank">workstation laptops come in</a>. These powerful machines are designed to be desktop replacements but portable, so that scientists, engineers, developers, and anyone with the need for speed can get their work done in the field, whenever needed.</p>    <p>And that's what we've got on the test bench today. The HP ZBook X G1i is a 16-inch mobile workstation with Pro-level Nvidia discrete graphics, plenty of storage and memory, and a powerful CPU to chew through data analysis or AI tasks. It's the kind of machine that's honestly not made for everyone, but if you know you need the power it contains, it should have no substitute. This model is (almost) the top spec, with everything maxed out except that the display is the 2K version and not the 4K, but with added extras like 5G connectivity, you might be too busy to notice the pixel count.</p>    <p>It's the kind of laptop that can crunch numbers for <em>science</em>, or train AI models without needing a data center's power. Or, it would be, if the discrete Nvidia GPU had more than 8GB of VRAM to use. AI models benefit when they can be entirely stored in VRAM along with the data from the token window, and this simply isn't enough memory for the types of workloads that the power user who would usually buy this laptop would need.</p>    <p><em><strong>About this review:</strong> HP loaned me the ZBook X G1i for the purposes of this review. The company had no input in its content.</em></p>

<h2>
HP ZBook X G1i: Pricing and availability
</h2><h3>
Workstations don't come cheap
</h3>
<p>The HP ZBook X G1i was announced in March 2025, with an MSRP that starts from $3,401. Yes, that's the price of the lowest-tier model, with an Intel Core Ultra 5 225H CPU. That said, HP has a model with the Intel Core Ultra 5 235H, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD for $1,929 right now, so it's clear that pricing is predictably all over the place, as always when dealing with the non-standard models that aren't made for the general consumer market.</p>    <p>You can go up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H CPU and Nvidia RTX Pro 2000 mobile GPU, a tier above the model we're reviewing, and likely to be over $6,000 all-in. Mobile workstations are never "cheap," but when you know you need that power, that's the only consideration that matters.</p>

<p>While many 16-inch laptops could be treated as desktop replacements, only mobile workstations like this model really fit the bill. It's not just the power and portability; it's things like ISV qualifications, so the industry-standard software the professionals rely on has been tested to work reliably with this laptop. Things like CAD software, or physics modeling, and of course, AI models and their training.</p>    <p>And with that in mind, it's surprising to me that HP has put all that power under such a slimline chassis that is entirely aluminum and isn't that much thicker than the PowerPoint-pushing clamshells that are usually on my desk. It's got two USB-A ports, HDMI 2.1, an audio jack, and two Thunderbolt 4 ports, alongside an SD card reader, a smart card reader for those of you with device unlock policies that need one, and a SIM slot to take advantage of the sub-6GHz 5G modem that's onboard. Oh, and a fold-down 1GbE LAN port because, while it has Wi-Fi 7, nothing's as     <span><a href="/lessons-from-upgrading-to-home-network-prosumer-gear/" target="_blank">stable as wired connectivity</a></span>.    </p>

</div>
</section><p>Make no bones about it, this is a laptop you'll want to use, not because you spend exorbitant amounts of money on it, but because it's gorgeous to touch. The aluminum has a soft-touch texture that's grippy while feeling premium. There is zero flex anywhere when typing or holding it up with one hand, and you can tell that it's built to survive heavy workloads in situations that might not be anywhere near a desk.</p>    <h2>
The display is pretty nice too
</h2><h3>
And it's not even the top tier 4K model
</h3>

</div>
</div>
<p>This model has the display one down from the ultra-premium 4K panel, but the 16-inch, 2.5K (2560x1600) IPS panel is no slouch. It's got a 120Hz refresh rate with dynamic refresh rate in Windows, anti-glare coating, and 400 nits of brightness. It's on the better end of panels that I've used this year without being OLED, and going with the hardier IPS is honestly the right play for a workstation anyway.</p>    <p>After testing with the Datacolor SpyderPro, I found this panel pretty good. It covers 100% sRGB, 98% AdobeRGB, 99% P3, and 96% NTSC, outperforming many of the consumer OLED panels I've used. It peaks at 458.7 nits of brightness, which is good, but only when the backlight is set to 100%.</p>    <p>It falls off sharply when you reduce the backlight to save power, and it's only 208.6 nits at 75% brightness, 109.5 nits at 50%, and 57 nits at 25% brightness. This makes it hard to use at anything but the highest brightness level, although 50% is close to the suggested target when doing color-accurate design work.</p>    <p>Adding to that is a disappointing 2.34 deltaE average color accuracy value. I don't like doing color work on anything above 2.0 deltaE away from expected color, and I'm sure many (most?) digital designers will agree. The luminance uniformity is even more scattered, and this is not the panel quality you'd expect from this laptop class in 2025.</p>    <h2>

<p>I'm not sure exactly what performance figures I was expecting, but for a laptop that costs just shy of 6 grand, I was underwhelmed. It's true this is the Core Ultra 7 model and not the Core Ultra 9, but I expected more from the Nvidia RTX Pro 2000. Maybe the lack of GDDR7 VRAM (only 8GB) was the reason, but regardless of the Windows power profile, or if the laptop was plugged in, the results were very similar.</p>    <p>It feels like HP intentionally limits the power available in order to keep thermals in check, because at no point during my testing did the top of the keyboard get warm. Is that the behavior you'd want from a mobile workstation? I'm not so sure, and I'd prefer more power, slightly toastier fingertips while typing.</p>    <div>

<p>But benchmarks are only part of the story. Like last year's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/hp-zbook-studio-g11-review/" target="_blank">ZBook Studio 16 G11</a>, the ZBook X G1i is a mixed bag in real-world usage. The occasional stutter when browsing or working on large documents is fine, really, and could be Windows being Windows. But it was so frisky when downloading updates or new programs, far more so than my significantly more powerful desktop PC. And trying to charge via the Thunderbolt 4 ports would always throw a "this charger isn't powerful enough" error, even when using a dock that matches the 150W power brick the workstation comes with.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">

<div><p>In this realm, value takes a backseat to the simple equation of "can it do the task or not," and in that calculus, the HP ZBook X G1i is very good indeed.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Mobile workstations aren't known for their battery life, but this year, mobile chips are designed to be powerful and efficient. We ran the ZBook X G1i through the Procyon Productivity Test, and it tapped out after 4 hours and 23 minutes. That's the worst performer I've used <em>all year,</em> and I can't even blame it on the Blackwell discrete GPU. It's not quite as bad as gaming laptops, but it's time to rethink your priorities when your other choice as a creative professional is a MacBook Pro that can outlast by several times that number.</p>    <h2>

<p><strong>You SHOULD buy the HP ZBook X G1i if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
<strong>You need a mobile workstation, and cost is no object</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>You don't want a thick, noisy laptop</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>You need to run Windows-only programs</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You SHOULD NOT buy the HP ZBook X G1i if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
<strong>You want to play games on your laptop as well</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Your work isn't footing the bill</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>You need a long battery life</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The HP ZBook X G1i is a seriously svelte and superbly powerful mobile workstation. On the higher-end models, like the one reviewed, it's got the chops to chew through complex calculations, 3D modeling, and anything else you could dream up. But if you can't afford to crank the sliders up to the top, it's no different from most consumer laptops, except the price tag is twice what you'd expect to pay for a comparable Arrow Lake mobile clamshell with no discrete GPU.</p>

</section><p>That said, anyone needing a mobile workstation won't be settling for second-best, which means speccing it out to the nines. In this realm, value takes a backseat to the simple equation of "can it do the task or not," and in that calculus, the HP ZBook X G1i is very good indeed. The only question mark is over the 8GB of VRAM on the discrete GPU, because while it's enough for video editing or other creative tasks, it's nowhere near enough to deal with many of the AI models that you might want to use in the field.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The era of ultralight laptops is great for those who only need basic computing tasks, but for anything more strenuous, they fall flat. And that's where <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-workstation-laptops/" target="_blank">workstation laptops come in</a>. These powerful machines are designed to be desktop replacements but portable, so that scientists, engineers, developers, and anyone with the need for speed can get their work done in the field, whenever needed.</p>    <p>And that's what we've got on the test bench today. The HP ZBook X G1i is a 16-inch mobile workstation with Pro-level Nvidia discrete graphics, plenty of storage and memory, and a powerful CPU to chew through data analysis or AI tasks. It's the kind of machine that's honestly not made for everyone, but if you know you need the power it contains, it should have no substitute. This model is (almost) the top spec, with everything maxed out except that the display is the 2K version and not the 4K, but with added extras like 5G connectivity, you might be too busy to notice the pixel count.</p>    <p>It's the kind of laptop that can crunch numbers for <em>science</em>, or train AI models without needing a data center's power. Or, it would be, if the discrete Nvidia GPU had more than 8GB of VRAM to use. AI models benefit when they can be entirely stored in VRAM along with the data from the token window, and this simply isn't enough memory for the types of workloads that the power user who would usually buy this laptop would need.</p>    <p><em><strong>About this review:</strong> HP loaned me the ZBook X G1i for the purposes of this review. The company had no input in its content.</em></p>

<h2>
HP ZBook X G1i: Pricing and availability
</h2><h3>
Workstations don't come cheap
</h3>
<p>The HP ZBook X G1i was announced in March 2025, with an MSRP that starts from $3,401. Yes, that's the price of the lowest-tier model, with an Intel Core Ultra 5 225H CPU. That said, HP has a model with the Intel Core Ultra 5 235H, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD for $1,929 right now, so it's clear that pricing is predictably all over the place, as always when dealing with the non-standard models that aren't made for the general consumer market.</p>    <p>You can go up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H CPU and Nvidia RTX Pro 2000 mobile GPU, a tier above the model we're reviewing, and likely to be over $6,000 all-in. Mobile workstations are never "cheap," but when you know you need that power, that's the only consideration that matters.</p>

<p>While many 16-inch laptops could be treated as desktop replacements, only mobile workstations like this model really fit the bill. It's not just the power and portability; it's things like ISV qualifications, so the industry-standard software the professionals rely on has been tested to work reliably with this laptop. Things like CAD software, or physics modeling, and of course, AI models and their training.</p>    <p>And with that in mind, it's surprising to me that HP has put all that power under such a slimline chassis that is entirely aluminum and isn't that much thicker than the PowerPoint-pushing clamshells that are usually on my desk. It's got two USB-A ports, HDMI 2.1, an audio jack, and two Thunderbolt 4 ports, alongside an SD card reader, a smart card reader for those of you with device unlock policies that need one, and a SIM slot to take advantage of the sub-6GHz 5G modem that's onboard. Oh, and a fold-down 1GbE LAN port because, while it has Wi-Fi 7, nothing's as     <span><a href="/lessons-from-upgrading-to-home-network-prosumer-gear/" target="_blank">stable as wired connectivity</a></span>.    </p>

</div>
</section><p>Make no bones about it, this is a laptop you'll want to use, not because you spend exorbitant amounts of money on it, but because it's gorgeous to touch. The aluminum has a soft-touch texture that's grippy while feeling premium. There is zero flex anywhere when typing or holding it up with one hand, and you can tell that it's built to survive heavy workloads in situations that might not be anywhere near a desk.</p>    <h2>
The display is pretty nice too
</h2><h3>
And it's not even the top tier 4K model
</h3>

</div>
</div>
<p>This model has the display one down from the ultra-premium 4K panel, but the 16-inch, 2.5K (2560x1600) IPS panel is no slouch. It's got a 120Hz refresh rate with dynamic refresh rate in Windows, anti-glare coating, and 400 nits of brightness. It's on the better end of panels that I've used this year without being OLED, and going with the hardier IPS is honestly the right play for a workstation anyway.</p>    <p>After testing with the Datacolor SpyderPro, I found this panel pretty good. It covers 100% sRGB, 98% AdobeRGB, 99% P3, and 96% NTSC, outperforming many of the consumer OLED panels I've used. It peaks at 458.7 nits of brightness, which is good, but only when the backlight is set to 100%.</p>    <p>It falls off sharply when you reduce the backlight to save power, and it's only 208.6 nits at 75% brightness, 109.5 nits at 50%, and 57 nits at 25% brightness. This makes it hard to use at anything but the highest brightness level, although 50% is close to the suggested target when doing color-accurate design work.</p>    <p>Adding to that is a disappointing 2.34 deltaE average color accuracy value. I don't like doing color work on anything above 2.0 deltaE away from expected color, and I'm sure many (most?) digital designers will agree. The luminance uniformity is even more scattered, and this is not the panel quality you'd expect from this laptop class in 2025.</p>    <h2>

<p>I'm not sure exactly what performance figures I was expecting, but for a laptop that costs just shy of 6 grand, I was underwhelmed. It's true this is the Core Ultra 7 model and not the Core Ultra 9, but I expected more from the Nvidia RTX Pro 2000. Maybe the lack of GDDR7 VRAM (only 8GB) was the reason, but regardless of the Windows power profile, or if the laptop was plugged in, the results were very similar.</p>    <p>It feels like HP intentionally limits the power available in order to keep thermals in check, because at no point during my testing did the top of the keyboard get warm. Is that the behavior you'd want from a mobile workstation? I'm not so sure, and I'd prefer more power, slightly toastier fingertips while typing.</p>    <div>

<p>But benchmarks are only part of the story. Like last year's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/hp-zbook-studio-g11-review/" target="_blank">ZBook Studio 16 G11</a>, the ZBook X G1i is a mixed bag in real-world usage. The occasional stutter when browsing or working on large documents is fine, really, and could be Windows being Windows. But it was so frisky when downloading updates or new programs, far more so than my significantly more powerful desktop PC. And trying to charge via the Thunderbolt 4 ports would always throw a "this charger isn't powerful enough" error, even when using a dock that matches the 150W power brick the workstation comes with.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">

<div><p>In this realm, value takes a backseat to the simple equation of "can it do the task or not," and in that calculus, the HP ZBook X G1i is very good indeed.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Mobile workstations aren't known for their battery life, but this year, mobile chips are designed to be powerful and efficient. We ran the ZBook X G1i through the Procyon Productivity Test, and it tapped out after 4 hours and 23 minutes. That's the worst performer I've used <em>all year,</em> and I can't even blame it on the Blackwell discrete GPU. It's not quite as bad as gaming laptops, but it's time to rethink your priorities when your other choice as a creative professional is a MacBook Pro that can outlast by several times that number.</p>    <h2>
Should you buy the HP ZBook X G1i?
</h2>
<div>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>You SHOULD buy the HP ZBook X G1i if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
<strong>You need a mobile workstation, and cost is no object</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>You don't want a thick, noisy laptop</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>You need to run Windows-only programs</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You SHOULD NOT buy the HP ZBook X G1i if:</strong></p>        <ul>
<li>
<strong>You want to play games on your laptop as well</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Your work isn't footing the bill</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>You need a long battery life</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The HP ZBook X G1i is a seriously svelte and superbly powerful mobile workstation. On the higher-end models, like the one reviewed, it's got the chops to chew through complex calculations, 3D modeling, and anything else you could dream up. But if you can't afford to crank the sliders up to the top, it's no different from most consumer laptops, except the price tag is twice what you'd expect to pay for a comparable Arrow Lake mobile clamshell with no discrete GPU.</p>

</div>
</section><p>That said, anyone needing a mobile workstation won't be settling for second-best, which means speccing it out to the nines. In this realm, value takes a backseat to the simple equation of "can it do the task or not," and in that calculus, the HP ZBook X G1i is very good indeed. The only question mark is over the 8GB of VRAM on the discrete GPU, because while it's enough for video editing or other creative tasks, it's nowhere near enough to deal with many of the AI models that you might want to use in the field.</p>

<p>The HP ZBook X G1i is a true mobile workstation replacement, able to handle heavy computing tasks while away from a desk. It's not the most value-oriented model, but that's a secondary consideration when professional projects hinge on whether the tools are up to the task at hand.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>For years, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/im-finally-using-proxmox-in-my-home-lab/" target="_blank">Proxmox has been the go-to choice</a> for anyone building a home lab or small virtualization cluster. Its combination of simplicity, built-in backup options, and flexibility for both virtual machines and containers has made it a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ill-stick-with-proxmox-even-though-the-free-version-of-esxi-is-back/" target="_blank">favorite among self-hosters</a> and IT professionals alike. But Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, has quietly introduced something that could give Proxmox real competition: Ubuntu MicroCloud.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>Ubuntu MicroCloud represents a new direction for home and small-scale cloud infrastructure.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>MicroCloud isn’t another hypervisor clone or Docker wrapper. It’s a full suite of technologies Canonical has integrated into a cohesive platform designed to manage lightweight private clouds at scale. Built around LXD, Ceph, and OVN, it offers everything you’d expect from a production-ready environment but with a focus on automation, simplicity, and long-term support. For users who have outgrown single-node Proxmox setups, MicroCloud provides a smooth, enterprise-backed path forward.</p>    <h2>
What Ubuntu MicroCloud brings to the table
</h2><h3>
Canonical’s integrated cloud-in-a-box approach
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-647165406" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-647165406" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-647165406" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-647165406" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-647165406-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Ubuntu MicroCloud combines multiple Canonical tools under one name, but they’ve been engineered to work together for years. LXD handles container and virtual machine orchestration, while Ceph provides highly available storage across nodes. OVN powers the virtual networking stack, making it simple to isolate workloads or create overlay networks. Together, they form a modular but unified cloud environment that behaves like a smaller version of OpenStack, without the same overhead or complexity.</p>    <p>The strength of MicroCloud lies in its ability to abstract away the typical pain points of multi-node setups. Adding new nodes, configuring storage pools, or creating new instances takes only a few commands. Once deployed, the cluster automatically manages replication and storage balance. This makes it appealing for home lab users who want to grow beyond a single box without maintaining dozens of individual configurations.</p>    <p>Unlike traditional hypervisor platforms, MicroCloud is built with cloud-native principles in mind. It’s API-first, meaning everything you can do through the command line can also be automated through scripts or integrated with CI/CD pipelines. For those already running Ubuntu across their devices, it also aligns perfectly with Canonical’s support model, offering optional long-term commercial backing.</p>    <h2>
How it stacks up against Proxmox
</h2><h3>
Strengths in automation and scalability
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-2030626733" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-2030626733" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-2030626733" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-2030626733" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-2030626733-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Proxmox’s most significant advantage has always been its simplicity. You can <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-love-my-proxmox-cluster/" target="_blank">install it on a single server</a> and be up and running in minutes. However, as your infrastructure grows, managing multiple nodes becomes more cumbersome. MicroCloud was designed to solve that from the start. By integrating clustering, networking, and distributed storage out of the box, it scales horizontally without needing additional configuration or third-party plugins.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>You can deploy Ubuntu MicroCloud onto an existing Ubuntu desktop or server, but there are some caveats to bear in mind. For example, if Docker is already installed, you should uninstall or disable it to prevent networking conflicts. Also, if LXD is already initialized on the host, you will need to remove it completely before installing MicroCloud.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Automation is another area where MicroCloud shines. With a single configuration, users can deploy clusters that automatically distribute workloads and storage replicas across available hardware. Proxmox has similar functionality through Ceph integration, but it often requires manual setup. Canonical’s approach feels smoother, especially for those who prefer scripting deployments instead of clicking through a web interface.</p>    <p>To get started testing Ubuntu MicroCloud, you’ll need to be sure your host meets the following minimum requirements:</p>        <ul>
<li>
Minimum 8GB of RAM.
</li>
<li>
Ubuntu 22.04 or newer installed (LTS version recommended).
</li>
<li>
A single network interface can be used, but is unsupported.
</li>
<li>
Disks used for storage should be free of existing partitions or file systems.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, MicroCloud doesn’t aim to completely reinvent the virtualization experience. It retains familiar concepts like VMs and containers but packages them in a way that feels more like running a personal cloud than managing a cluster of servers. This makes it an attractive step up for home labbers or small businesses seeking enterprise-grade reliability without having to jump straight to OpenStack or VMware.</p>    <h2>
Where Proxmox still pulls ahead
</h2><h3>
Interface polish and user accessibility
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-726761546" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-726761546" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-726761546" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-726761546" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-726761546-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>While Ubuntu MicroCloud is powerful, it lacks some of the visual polish and accessibility that make Proxmox so approachable. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-installed-proxmox-on-a-decade-old-laptop/" target="_blank">Proxmox’s web interface</a> remains one of the easiest ways to monitor and manage a virtualized environment, especially for those who prefer point-and-click administration. MicroCloud, by contrast, is predominantly command-line driven. There is a web GUI, but it's only exposed post-installation after MicroCloud is running. It also isn't as polished and comprehensive as Proxmox's UI, but it gets the jobb done. The CLI suits developers and Linux administrators perfectly, but it can feel daunting for those accustomed to GUI-based management.</p>    <p>Proxmox also has a more mature backup and restore ecosystem. Its built-in tools for scheduled snapshots, incremental backups, and offsite replication are tightly integrated and well-documented. MicroCloud users can achieve similar results by utilizing Canonical’s automation and snapshot features in LXD, but this doees require additional setup. This difference matters if you’re running mission-critical workloads or just want something easy to recover after an experiment goes wrong.</p>    <p>Finally, Proxmox benefits from a large, active community and years of proven stability in mixed environments. Ubuntu MicroCloud is newer, still evolving, and hasn’t yet established the same grassroots support. Canonical provides strong enterprise-level documentation, but the kind of “home lab-first” knowledge base that makes Proxmox so approachable is still missing. For now, that gives Proxmox an edge in day-to-day usability for many users.</p>    <h2>
A glimpse at a new kind of home lab
</h2><p>Ubuntu MicroCloud doesn’t just compete with Proxmox; it represents a new direction for home and small-scale cloud infrastructure. It’s designed for those who want to automate, scale, and integrate their systems using modern principles rather than maintaining individual hypervisors. While Proxmox remains the more accessible and community-rich option, MicroCloud’s modular architecture and Canonical’s backing make it one to watch. If you’re ready to move from managing servers to orchestrating your own private cloud, MicroCloud is well worth exploring.</p>

Its combination of simplicity, built-in backup options, and flexibility for both virtual machines and containers has made it a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ill-stick-with-proxmox-even-though-the-free-version-of-esxi-is-back/" target="_blank">favorite among self-hosters</a> and IT professionals alike. But Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, has quietly introduced something that could give Proxmox real competition: Ubuntu MicroCloud.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>Ubuntu MicroCloud represents a new direction for home and small-scale cloud infrastructure.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>MicroCloud isn’t another hypervisor clone or Docker wrapper. It’s a full suite of technologies Canonical has integrated into a cohesive platform designed to manage lightweight private clouds at scale. Built around LXD, Ceph, and OVN, it offers everything you’d expect from a production-ready environment but with a focus on automation, simplicity, and long-term support. For users who have outgrown single-node Proxmox setups, MicroCloud provides a smooth, enterprise-backed path forward.</p>    <h2>
What Ubuntu MicroCloud brings to the table
</h2><h3>
Canonical’s integrated cloud-in-a-box approach
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-647165406" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-647165406" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-647165406" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-647165406" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-647165406-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Ubuntu MicroCloud combines multiple Canonical tools under one name, but they’ve been engineered to work together for years. LXD handles container and virtual machine orchestration, while Ceph provides highly available storage across nodes. OVN powers the virtual networking stack, making it simple to isolate workloads or create overlay networks. Together, they form a modular but unified cloud environment that behaves like a smaller version of OpenStack, without the same overhead or complexity.</p>    <p>The strength of MicroCloud lies in its ability to abstract away the typical pain points of multi-node setups. Adding new nodes, configuring storage pools, or creating new instances takes only a few commands. Once deployed, the cluster automatically manages replication and storage balance. This makes it appealing for home lab users who want to grow beyond a single box without maintaining dozens of individual configurations.</p>    <p>Unlike traditional hypervisor platforms, MicroCloud is built with cloud-native principles in mind. It’s API-first, meaning everything you can do through the command line can also be automated through scripts or integrated with CI/CD pipelines. For those already running Ubuntu across their devices, it also aligns perfectly with Canonical’s support model, offering optional long-term commercial backing.</p>    <h2>
How it stacks up against Proxmox
</h2><h3>
Strengths in automation and scalability
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-2030626733" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-2030626733" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-2030626733" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-2030626733" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-2030626733-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Proxmox’s most significant advantage has always been its simplicity. You can <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-love-my-proxmox-cluster/" target="_blank">install it on a single server</a> and be up and running in minutes. However, as your infrastructure grows, managing multiple nodes becomes more cumbersome. MicroCloud was designed to solve that from the start. By integrating clustering, networking, and distributed storage out of the box, it scales horizontally without needing additional configuration or third-party plugins.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>You can deploy Ubuntu MicroCloud onto an existing Ubuntu desktop or server, but there are some caveats to bear in mind. For example, if Docker is already installed, you should uninstall or disable it to prevent networking conflicts. Also, if LXD is already initialized on the host, you will need to remove it completely before installing MicroCloud.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Automation is another area where MicroCloud shines. With a single configuration, users can deploy clusters that automatically distribute workloads and storage replicas across available hardware. Proxmox has similar functionality through Ceph integration, but it often requires manual setup. Canonical’s approach feels smoother, especially for those who prefer scripting deployments instead of clicking through a web interface.</p>    <p>To get started testing Ubuntu MicroCloud, you’ll need to be sure your host meets the following minimum requirements:</p>        <ul>
<li>
Minimum 8GB of RAM.
</li>
<li>
Ubuntu 22.04 or newer installed (LTS version recommended).
</li>
<li>
A single network interface can be used, but is unsupported.
</li>
<li>
Disks used for storage should be free of existing partitions or file systems.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, MicroCloud doesn’t aim to completely reinvent the virtualization experience. It retains familiar concepts like VMs and containers but packages them in a way that feels more like running a personal cloud than managing a cluster of servers. This makes it an attractive step up for home labbers or small businesses seeking enterprise-grade reliability without having to jump straight to OpenStack or VMware.</p>    <h2>
Where Proxmox still pulls ahead
</h2><h3>
Interface polish and user accessibility
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-726761546" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-726761546" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-726761546" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-726761546" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-726761546-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>While Ubuntu MicroCloud is powerful, it lacks some of the visual polish and accessibility that make Proxmox so approachable. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-installed-proxmox-on-a-decade-old-laptop/" target="_blank">Proxmox’s web interface</a> remains one of the easiest ways to monitor and manage a virtualized environment, especially for those who prefer point-and-click administration. MicroCloud, by contrast, is predominantly command-line driven. There is a web GUI, but it's only exposed post-installation after MicroCloud is running. It also isn't as polished and comprehensive as Proxmox's UI, but it gets the jobb done. The CLI suits developers and Linux administrators perfectly, but it can feel daunting for those accustomed to GUI-based management.</p>    <p>Proxmox also has a more mature backup and restore ecosystem. Its built-in tools for scheduled snapshots, incremental backups, and offsite replication are tightly integrated and well-documented. MicroCloud users can achieve similar results by utilizing Canonical’s automation and snapshot features in LXD, but this doees require additional setup. This difference matters if you’re running mission-critical workloads or just want something easy to recover after an experiment goes wrong.</p>    <p>Finally, Proxmox benefits from a large, active community and years of proven stability in mixed environments. Ubuntu MicroCloud is newer, still evolving, and hasn’t yet established the same grassroots support. Canonical provides strong enterprise-level documentation, but the kind of “home lab-first” knowledge base that makes Proxmox so approachable is still missing. For now, that gives Proxmox an edge in day-to-day usability for many users.</p>    <h2>
A glimpse at a new kind of home lab
</h2><p>Ubuntu MicroCloud doesn’t just compete with Proxmox; it represents a new direction for home and small-scale cloud infrastructure. It’s designed for those who want to automate, scale, and integrate their systems using modern principles rather than maintaining individual hypervisors. While Proxmox remains the more accessible and community-rich option, MicroCloud’s modular architecture and Canonical’s backing make it one to watch. If you’re ready to move from managing servers to orchestrating your own private cloud, MicroCloud is well worth exploring.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>If you find yourself endlessly by <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, then you'll want to give <em>Ball x Pit</em> a look. Its title may be ridiculous, but this mashup of <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Breakout</em>, launching on October 15, is one of my favorite games of the year. Ever since I began playing it a couple of weeks ago, I've struggled to put the controller down and play games like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-review/" target="_blank"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/possible-problems-with-ghost-of-yotei-after-latest-showcase" target="_blank"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a> instead.</p>    <p>It's that good. <em>Ball x Pit</em> taps into the same frantic yet immensely rewarding <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/roguelike-games-need-play" target="_blank">roguelite gameplay loop</a> <em>Vampire Survivors</em> does, but reframes it in the gameplay style of <em>Breakout</em>, with the player shooting balls at seemingly never-ending waves of block-like enemies in front of them. It taps into a primal sense of satisfaction that my favorite games do while constantly also finding ways to reinvent itself. You may not have heard of Ball x Pit, but it's out on Xbox Game Pass soon and just as enthralling as other <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-indie-games-steam" target="_blank">indie darlings</a> like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Balatro</em>. </p>    <h2>
What is Ball x Pit?
</h2><h3>
And how do you play it?
</h3>
<p><em>Ball x Pit</em> is like <em>Breakout </em>in that the goal is to shoot balls at blocks. That said, many of those balls have special attributes, like shooting a laser horizontally or healing the player every time they hit an enemy. You also don't always need to catch them before they reach the bottom of the screen; they'll just bounce or return to you so you can shoot them again. This emphasis on action is where the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/vampire-survivors-best-secrets-unlocks" target="_blank"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> influence comes in. The blocks are enemies that can attack and kill the player, so the player has to fight back by leveling up to obtain new balls and passive abilities.</p>    <p>It's a roguelite too, which means each run through a level of <em>Ball x Pit </em>is wholly distinct in the balls and passive abilities players have at their disposal. Of course, you do have some control over the experience, as you can choose between different "Hunters" with special abilities before a run and, within a run, determine what kinds of balls and passive abilities you want to unlock. Beat all three bosses in a stage, and you'll clear it, earning gears that unlock new levels.</p>    <p>While the core concept of "point and shoot balls at the enemy" is simple, <em>Ball x Pit</em> introduces lots of permutations. You can fuse and evolve the different balls you have, creating everything from a laser beam that shoots in four directions to a nuclear bomb that blows up anything around it. Late-game Hunter unlocks also redefine how you play. One of my favorites is the Shieldbearer, which gives players a bonus every time they bounce a ball back up off their shield.</p>    <p>Between runs, players also build out a homestead. Each new building unlocked something, consistently keeping me excited to see what was coming next. When you pick up and play <em>Ball x Pit</em>, it's surprisingly intuitive, building on the foundation laid by several excellent games before it. It's wholly distinct in a very charming way, though. And that made this game feel tailor-made for me.</p>    <h2>
Why I love Ball x Pit so much
</h2><h3>
An awesome blend of some of my favorite games
</h3>

<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-887480883" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-887480883" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-887480883" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-887480883" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-887480883-img" data-gallery-type="">

</div>
<p>When I was a kid, I remember one of the first mobile games to even enrapture me was a <em>Breakout </em>clone called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Breaker" target="_blank"><em>Brick Breaker</em></a> that I could play on my mom's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/blackberry-phones-might-be-making-return/" target="_blank">BlackBerry phone</a>. Even with the BlackBerry's clunky keyboard, something about the simple catharsis of clearing a game board of bricks absolutely commanded and held my attention. Sometimes the simplest games are the most enthralling.</p>    <p>As I got older, I eventually learned that <em>Brick Breaker</em> was a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/new-breakout-style-game-from-google" target="_blank"><em>Breakout </em>clone</a>, and sought out any new <em>Breakout</em>-like game I could find. <em>Shatter Remastered</em> and <em>Breakout Beyond</em> are some of my favorites from recent years. Now, I'm going to add <em>Ball x Pit</em> to that pile. It does play a bit differently than your standard <em>Breakout </em>clone, but taps into the same ball-bouncing, screen-clearing, gratifying action.</p>    <p>Its roguelite structure is also a welcome match. Just like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, <em>Ball x Pit</em> uses that repetitive setup to slowly reveal itself to players over time. That happens within runs, as there's always a sense of discovery as I try out new ball fusion and evolutions, as well as new passive abilities. There's also the meta-level progression that happened as I expanded my homestead.</p>    <p>As I added more buildings and unlocked new characters, entire new facets of how to play opened up for me. I could shoot from the back of the game board rather than the front, bring two characters into a run with me, or transform it into a turn-based game that made me rethink how I positioned myself. <em>Ball x Pit</em> is repetitive enough to stay engaging, but experimental enough that its repetition never gets old.</p>    <h2>
Don't miss out on trying Ball x Pit
</h2><h3>
It's one of 2025's best indie games

<p>Every year, some indie game unexpectedly comes along, surprises me, and becomes one of my favorites of the year. Last year, <em>Balatro </em>took that mantle for me; <em>Ball x Pit</em> is 2025's contender. It's a mashup of games that feel tailor-made for me as a fan of <em>Breakout </em>and roguelikes, and features a surprising amount of depth for a concept that seems so straightforward on the surface.</p>    <p>With so many indie games coming out every week, it can be tough to tell which ones are worth your time. Don't let <em>Ball x Pit</em> fly under the radar for you, especially if you love <em>Vampire Survivors</em> or a good arcade-like game. It has a demo on Steam right now and will be part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate catalog at release on October 15, so you have some easy ways to experience it for yourself.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>If you find yourself endlessly by <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, then you'll want to give <em>Ball x Pit</em> a look. Its title may be ridiculous, but this mashup of <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Breakout</em>, launching on October 15, is one of my favorite games of the year. Ever since I began playing it a couple of weeks ago, I've struggled to put the controller down and play games like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-review/" target="_blank"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/possible-problems-with-ghost-of-yotei-after-latest-showcase" target="_blank"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a> instead.</p>    <p>It's that good. <em>Ball x Pit</em> taps into the same frantic yet immensely rewarding <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/roguelike-games-need-play" target="_blank">roguelite gameplay loop</a> <em>Vampire Survivors</em> does, but reframes it in the gameplay style of <em>Breakout</em>, with the player shooting balls at seemingly never-ending waves of block-like enemies in front of them. It taps into a primal sense of satisfaction that my favorite games do while constantly also finding ways to reinvent itself. You may not have heard of Ball x Pit, but it's out on Xbox Game Pass soon and just as enthralling as other <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-indie-games-steam" target="_blank">indie darlings</a> like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Balatro</em>. </p>    <h2>
What is Ball x Pit?
</h2><h3>
And how do you play it?
</h3>
<p><em>Ball x Pit</em> is like <em>Breakout </em>in that the goal is to shoot balls at blocks. That said, many of those balls have special attributes, like shooting a laser horizontally or healing the player every time they hit an enemy. You also don't always need to catch them before they reach the bottom of the screen; they'll just bounce or return to you so you can shoot them again. This emphasis on action is where the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/vampire-survivors-best-secrets-unlocks" target="_blank"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> influence comes in. The blocks are enemies that can attack and kill the player, so the player has to fight back by leveling up to obtain new balls and passive abilities.</p>    <p>It's a roguelite too, which means each run through a level of <em>Ball x Pit </em>is wholly distinct in the balls and passive abilities players have at their disposal. Of course, you do have some control over the experience, as you can choose between different "Hunters" with special abilities before a run and, within a run, determine what kinds of balls and passive abilities you want to unlock. Beat all three bosses in a stage, and you'll clear it, earning gears that unlock new levels.</p>    <p>While the core concept of "point and shoot balls at the enemy" is simple, <em>Ball x Pit</em> introduces lots of permutations. You can fuse and evolve the different balls you have, creating everything from a laser beam that shoots in four directions to a nuclear bomb that blows up anything around it. Late-game Hunter unlocks also redefine how you play. One of my favorites is the Shieldbearer, which gives players a bonus every time they bounce a ball back up off their shield.</p>    <p>Between runs, players also build out a homestead. Each new building unlocked something, consistently keeping me excited to see what was coming next. When you pick up and play <em>Ball x Pit</em>, it's surprisingly intuitive, building on the foundation laid by several excellent games before it. It's wholly distinct in a very charming way, though. And that made this game feel tailor-made for me.</p>    <h2>
Why I love Ball x Pit so much
</h2><h3>
An awesome blend of some of my favorite games
</h3>

<p>When I was a kid, I remember one of the first mobile games to even enrapture me was a <em>Breakout </em>clone called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Breaker" target="_blank"><em>Brick Breaker</em></a> that I could play on my mom's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/blackberry-phones-might-be-making-return/" target="_blank">BlackBerry phone</a>. Even with the BlackBerry's clunky keyboard, something about the simple catharsis of clearing a game board of bricks absolutely commanded and held my attention. Sometimes the simplest games are the most enthralling.</p>    <p>As I got older, I eventually learned that <em>Brick Breaker</em> was a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/new-breakout-style-game-from-google" target="_blank"><em>Breakout </em>clone</a>, and sought out any new <em>Breakout</em>-like game I could find. <em>Shatter Remastered</em> and <em>Breakout Beyond</em> are some of my favorites from recent years. Now, I'm going to add <em>Ball x Pit</em> to that pile. It does play a bit differently than your standard <em>Breakout </em>clone, but taps into the same ball-bouncing, screen-clearing, gratifying action.</p>    <p>Its roguelite structure is also a welcome match. Just like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, <em>Ball x Pit</em> uses that repetitive setup to slowly reveal itself to players over time. That happens within runs, as there's always a sense of discovery as I try out new ball fusion and evolutions, as well as new passive abilities. There's also the meta-level progression that happened as I expanded my homestead.</p>    <p>As I added more buildings and unlocked new characters, entire new facets of how to play opened up for me. I could shoot from the back of the game board rather than the front, bring two characters into a run with me, or transform it into a turn-based game that made me rethink how I positioned myself. <em>Ball x Pit</em> is repetitive enough to stay engaging, but experimental enough that its repetition never gets old.</p>    <h2>
Don't miss out on trying Ball x Pit
</h2><h3>
It's one of 2025's best indie games

<p>Every year, some indie game unexpectedly comes along, surprises me, and becomes one of my favorites of the year. Last year, <em>Balatro </em>took that mantle for me; <em>Ball x Pit</em> is 2025's contender. It's a mashup of games that feel tailor-made for me as a fan of <em>Breakout </em>and roguelikes, and features a surprising amount of depth for a concept that seems so straightforward on the surface.</p>    <p>With so many indie games coming out every week, it can be tough to tell which ones are worth your time. Don't let <em>Ball x Pit</em> fly under the radar for you, especially if you love <em>Vampire Survivors</em> or a good arcade-like game. It has a demo on Steam right now and will be part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate catalog at release on October 15, so you have some easy ways to experience it for yourself.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you find yourself endlessly by <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, then you'll want to give <em>Ball x Pit</em> a look. Its title may be ridiculous, but this mashup of <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Breakout</em>, launching on October 15, is one of my favorite games of the year. Ever since I began playing it a couple of weeks ago, I've struggled to put the controller down and play games like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-review/" target="_blank"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/possible-problems-with-ghost-of-yotei-after-latest-showcase" target="_blank"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a> instead.</p>    <p>It's that good. <em>Ball x Pit</em> taps into the same frantic yet immensely rewarding <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/roguelike-games-need-play" target="_blank">roguelite gameplay loop</a> <em>Vampire Survivors</em> does, but reframes it in the gameplay style of <em>Breakout</em>, with the player shooting balls at seemingly never-ending waves of block-like enemies in front of them. It taps into a primal sense of satisfaction that my favorite games do while constantly also finding ways to reinvent itself. You may not have heard of Ball x Pit, but it's out on Xbox Game Pass soon and just as enthralling as other <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-indie-games-steam" target="_blank">indie darlings</a> like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Balatro</em>. </p>    <h2>
What is Ball x Pit?
</h2><h3>
And how do you play it?
</h3>
<p><em>Ball x Pit</em> is like <em>Breakout </em>in that the goal is to shoot balls at blocks. That said, many of those balls have special attributes, like shooting a laser horizontally or healing the player every time they hit an enemy. You also don't always need to catch them before they reach the bottom of the screen; they'll just bounce or return to you so you can shoot them again. This emphasis on action is where the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/vampire-survivors-best-secrets-unlocks" target="_blank"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> influence comes in. The blocks are enemies that can attack and kill the player, so the player has to fight back by leveling up to obtain new balls and passive abilities.</p>    <p>It's a roguelite too, which means each run through a level of <em>Ball x Pit </em>is wholly distinct in the balls and passive abilities players have at their disposal. Of course, you do have some control over the experience, as you can choose between different "Hunters" with special abilities before a run and, within a run, determine what kinds of balls and passive abilities you want to unlock. Beat all three bosses in a stage, and you'll clear it, earning gears that unlock new levels.</p>    <p>While the core concept of "point and shoot balls at the enemy" is simple, <em>Ball x Pit</em> introduces lots of permutations. You can fuse and evolve the different balls you have, creating everything from a laser beam that shoots in four directions to a nuclear bomb that blows up anything around it. Late-game Hunter unlocks also redefine how you play. One of my favorites is the Shieldbearer, which gives players a bonus every time they bounce a ball back up off their shield.</p>    <p>Between runs, players also build out a homestead. Each new building unlocked something, consistently keeping me excited to see what was coming next. When you pick up and play <em>Ball x Pit</em>, it's surprisingly intuitive, building on the foundation laid by several excellent games before it. It's wholly distinct in a very charming way, though. And that made this game feel tailor-made for me.</p>    <h2>
Why I love Ball x Pit so much
</h2><h3>
An awesome blend of some of my favorite games

<p>When I was a kid, I remember one of the first mobile games to even enrapture me was a <em>Breakout </em>clone called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Breaker" target="_blank"><em>Brick Breaker</em></a> that I could play on my mom's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/blackberry-phones-might-be-making-return/" target="_blank">BlackBerry phone</a>. Even with the BlackBerry's clunky keyboard, something about the simple catharsis of clearing a game board of bricks absolutely commanded and held my attention. Sometimes the simplest games are the most enthralling.</p>    <p>As I got older, I eventually learned that <em>Brick Breaker</em> was a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/new-breakout-style-game-from-google" target="_blank"><em>Breakout </em>clone</a>, and sought out any new <em>Breakout</em>-like game I could find. <em>Shatter Remastered</em> and <em>Breakout Beyond</em> are some of my favorites from recent years. Now, I'm going to add <em>Ball x Pit</em> to that pile. It does play a bit differently than your standard <em>Breakout </em>clone, but taps into the same ball-bouncing, screen-clearing, gratifying action.</p>    <p>Its roguelite structure is also a welcome match. Just like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, <em>Ball x Pit</em> uses that repetitive setup to slowly reveal itself to players over time. That happens within runs, as there's always a sense of discovery as I try out new ball fusion and evolutions, as well as new passive abilities. There's also the meta-level progression that happened as I expanded my homestead.</p>    <p>As I added more buildings and unlocked new characters, entire new facets of how to play opened up for me. I could shoot from the back of the game board rather than the front, bring two characters into a run with me, or transform it into a turn-based game that made me rethink how I positioned myself. <em>Ball x Pit</em> is repetitive enough to stay engaging, but experimental enough that its repetition never gets old.</p>    <h2>
Don't miss out on trying Ball x Pit
</h2><h3>
It's one of 2025's best indie games

<p>Every year, some indie game unexpectedly comes along, surprises me, and becomes one of my favorites of the year. Last year, <em>Balatro </em>took that mantle for me; <em>Ball x Pit</em> is 2025's contender. It's a mashup of games that feel tailor-made for me as a fan of <em>Breakout </em>and roguelikes, and features a surprising amount of depth for a concept that seems so straightforward on the surface.</p>    <p>With so many indie games coming out every week, it can be tough to tell which ones are worth your time. Don't let <em>Ball x Pit</em> fly under the radar for you, especially if you love <em>Vampire Survivors</em> or a good arcade-like game. It has a demo on Steam right now and will be part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate catalog at release on October 15, so you have some easy ways to experience it for yourself.</p>

It's not that I don't have the time, or that it won't help; I just don't consider it worth the effort. My PC doesn't have any severe dust deposits, and performance hasn't dropped either.

<p>My room isn't particularly prone to dust in the first place. Although my PC room has an attached balcony, the pleasant weather and high-speed winds force me to keep the door closed. Eliminating one of the biggest sources of dust has kept my PC mostly clean these past three years. The second contributing factor is that I keep my PC on my desk, and not on the ground, or worse, on a carpet. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/improve-pcs-airflow-without-buying-fans/" target="_blank">Enhanced airflow</a> and reduced dust intake keep my PC breathing freely, without suffering from major dust deposits. </p>    <p>Lastly, there's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/airflow-mistakes-in-mid-tower-pc/" target="_blank">positive air pressure</a> inside the case, which further keeps dust out. All of this isn't to say that I somehow have a magical PC that exists without any dust, but it's not even remotely close to warranting a deep clean every 6 months, or even 3 years, in my case. You need to adapt your PC maintenance to your room limitations and local conditions — not everyone needs to disassemble their PC twice a year for a deep clean.</p>    <h2>

<p>I might be in the minority, but I no longer like to have pets in the house. I love crossing paths with a stray cat as much as the next guy, but having a permanent pet inside my home is a no-no at this stage in my life — it's just too much work. A fortunate side effect is that I don't have to deal with pet hair sticking to every surface in the house, and worse, clogging my fans and heatsinks. I only have to deal with my own hair and dead skin finding their way inside my keyboard, but it's much easier to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-clean-mechanical-keyboard/" target="_blank">clean my keyboard</a>. </p>    <p>Another habit that keeps my PC free from severe grime deposits is that I don't smoke. I've seen first-hand what regular smoking can do to your CPU cooler's heatsink — thermal throttling and abrupt shut-downs are only some of the problems you could be facing. These favorable conditions have allowed me to have a PC perform just as well as it did years ago. Idle and load temps have not increased in any major way, and even visually, the amount of dust inside my case isn't an eyesore by any standard. </p>    <h2>

<p>My room isn't particularly prone to dust in the first place. Although my PC room has an attached balcony, the pleasant weather and high-speed winds force me to keep the door closed. Eliminating one of the biggest sources of dust has kept my PC mostly clean these past three years. The second contributing factor is that I keep my PC on my desk, and not on the ground, or worse, on a carpet. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/improve-pcs-airflow-without-buying-fans/" target="_blank">Enhanced airflow</a> and reduced dust intake keep my PC breathing freely, without suffering from major dust deposits. </p>    <p>Lastly, there's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/airflow-mistakes-in-mid-tower-pc/" target="_blank">positive air pressure</a> inside the case, which further keeps dust out. All of this isn't to say that I somehow have a magical PC that exists without any dust, but it's not even remotely close to warranting a deep clean every 6 months, or even 3 years, in my case. You need to adapt your PC maintenance to your room limitations and local conditions — not everyone needs to disassemble their PC twice a year for a deep clean.</p>    <h2>
No smoking or pets to make matters worse
</h2><h3>
There's always a silver lining

<p>I might be in the minority, but I no longer like to have pets in the house. I love crossing paths with a stray cat as much as the next guy, but having a permanent pet inside my home is a no-no at this stage in my life — it's just too much work. A fortunate side effect is that I don't have to deal with pet hair sticking to every surface in the house, and worse, clogging my fans and heatsinks. I only have to deal with my own hair and dead skin finding their way inside my keyboard, but it's much easier to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-clean-mechanical-keyboard/" target="_blank">clean my keyboard</a>. </p>    <p>Another habit that keeps my PC free from severe grime deposits is that I don't smoke. I've seen first-hand what regular smoking can do to your CPU cooler's heatsink — thermal throttling and abrupt shut-downs are only some of the problems you could be facing. These favorable conditions have allowed me to have a PC perform just as well as it did years ago. Idle and load temps have not increased in any major way, and even visually, the amount of dust inside my case isn't an eyesore by any standard. </p>    <h2>
Light upkeep has helped me avoid a deep clean
</h2><h3>
It's all about regular intervention
</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/signs-you-are-pc-luddite-like-me/" target="_blank">I might be a PC Luddite</a>, but I'm not a heathen. I despise dust coating my PC components, and once every few months, I clean all visible surfaces on and inside my case. This includes the intake vents, magnetic filters, case fans, graphics card, RAM, AIO pump, and motherboard. Regular dust removal from my case never allows things to get worse. Hence, I've never felt the need to perform a deep clean. Dismantling my entire build might become a necessity someday, and I'd be happy to indulge in an intensive cleaning session when that happens.</p>    <p>I'm not dissuading anyone from deep <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/clean-dust-pc-tower/" target="_blank">cleaning their PC</a> regularly; to each, their own. However, many users can realistically use their PC for years without performing one. Occasional cleaning of visible surfaces is enough to keep your PC performing at its potential, provided your room isn't prone to dust deposits, pet hair, smoke, or other such factors. Keeping your PC clean is a must for peak performance and an extended lifespan, but only when it's necessary. </p>    <h3>
Adapt PC maintenance to your unique conditions
</h3>
<p>Deep cleaning your PC is, of course, a must if your build is highly prone to major dust and grime deposits. Depending on the conditions in your locality, you might have to deep clean once every three months. That said, there are many cases where severe dust deposits are rare, and a deep clean might never be necessary. My PC room is fortunate to be mostly free of dust sources, which has allowed me to delay a deep clean for three years. Light cleaning every few months is all I need. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>Agentic browsers are the latest trend in the AI world, and honestly, I’m all for it. I’ve never been a fan of companies shoehorning AI into every possible feature, but my stance is simple: if a feature is genuinely useful and actually makes a difference, I’m going to use it.</p>    <p>Though I've tested my fair share of AI browsers and have <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-why-perplexity-comet-has-become-primary-browser" target="_blank">been using Comet as my primary browser</a>, the very first one I tried was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/opera-neon-browser-announcement/" target="_blank">Opera's Neon</a>. Back when I first tried it, it was a concept browser, and I was lucky enough to get the developer build to go hands-on with it.</p>    <p>From the moment I tried it, I was impressed. However, since Neon was still in developer build, I couldn't really make it my daily driver. A few days ago, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/favorite-ai-powered-browser-ready-to-launch/" target="_blank">Opera finally launched Neon officially</a>. Though there’s still a waitlist you need to join to get access, Opera has begun inviting its first batch of users, and I was lucky enough to be among them. I've been using it ever since, and it genuinely feels like Chrome and Comet fused into one.</p>    <h2>
What exactly is Opera Neon, and what can it do?

</div>
<p>By now, you've probably understood that Neon is Opera's own "agentic" browser. Though Opera formally announced this browser towards the end of May 2025, the company has been working on agentic AI for the past two years. They first announced Browser Operator, which was an AI agent that could browse and actually <em>do</em> things for you.</p>    <p>Think ordering a pair of socks for you or finding the cheapest ticket to Hawaii and booking it for you. The company then decided to merge this idea into a full-fledged browser experience — and that's how Neon was born. Opera introduced Neon with the hope of "reimagining what a browser can be in the age of intelligence agents."</p>    <p>The end goal here wasn't a browser that'd just have AI tools to summarize a webpage you're browsing or a built-in Chat area where you could quickly ask a word's definition. Instead, Neon is meant to act as a true assistant and is built with agentic AI at its core. Similar to when the browser was first launched, Neon's core functionality comes down to three use cases: <strong>Chat</strong>, <strong>Do</strong>, and <strong>Make</strong>.</p>    <p>Neon is a premium subscription product, and will retail for $19.99/month. As I mentioned above, you can't subscribe just yet and will need to join the waitlist before getting access.</p>    <h2>
Opera Neon's ability to <em>do</em> tasks is what makes it so special
</h2><h3>
Let Neon do all the heavy lifting
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Opera Neon Do booking a flight" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-12-at-11-31-21-pm.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>The idea behind agentic AI browsing is essentially to move beyond passive assistance. Neon's <strong>Do</strong> function is where its entire agentic ability lies, and it’s the feature that allows the browser to act on your behalf, not just guide you.</p>    <p>For example, when I was testing Neon's developer build, the first thing I’d do after opening the browser was quickly switch to <strong>Do</strong> mode and ask it to order my daily iced coffee. I’d include where I wanted to place the order from, what I wanted, and even my address. All I needed to do was prompt it. Neon handled everything from there.</p>    <p>There were times when Neon would still ask for my input, like confirming if I wanted to proceed with payment. If you’ve tried any AI browser with agentic abilities, you might’ve thought, “Hey, I can do the same task faster than the browser.” And while you’re not entirely wrong, you doing it faster than AI isn’t really the point. When an AI agent handles a monotonous task you perform every single day, it frees you up to do something else once you’ve prompted it.</p>    <p>For instance, when Neon would place my coffee order, I'd check my email and calendar. By the time I’m done, my order’s already on its way. That’s the real value of agentic browsing. It takes small, repetitive tasks off your plate so you can focus on things that actually need your attention. In that sense, Neon isn’t trying to outpace you; it’s trying to work with you. And once you get used to that rhythm, it’s hard to go back to a traditional browser that just sits idle, waiting for you to do all the work.</p>    <p>Perplexity’s Comet, which quickly became my go-to browser, also has agentic AI capabilities, but they’re not as polished as Neon’s. I tested Opera Neon and Comet side by side with the same prompt: <em>can you order eggs from [local shop name] for me?</em></p>    <p>By the time Neon was on the checkout page, Comet was stuck resolving an error, and then ended up just telling me how I could order eggs from the website I’d mentioned.</p>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="asking Perplexity Comet to buy eggs for me" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-13-at-12-26-59-am.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Given that Opera’s been working on agentic AI for so long, it’s no surprise that Neon’s Do functionality feels much more refined. I’ve tested both Neon and Comet with a lot more prompts like asking them to compare prices for a specific product, send an email, book a flight, you name it. And in almost every case, Neon handled the task much more smoothly.</p>    <h2>
Neon helps you organize your work with task-specific “mini browsers”

<img alt="Opera Neon Tabs feature in action" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-13-at-12-24-49-am.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>One Neon feature that's really impressed me in my testing is something Opera calls <strong>Tasks</strong>. It’s an organizational feature that creates dedicated workspaces for whatever you’re working on, and it’s something I’m yet to see implemented in another browser. The way it works is simple. You open a tab (which is your primary Task), and a <strong>plus</strong> button appears next to the search bar, where you can open subtasks related to your main Task.</p>    <p>Each Task functions like a mini browser that understands context, letting the AI analyze, compare, and act across multiple sources within that specific workspace, without mixing it up with everything else you have open. When I used Comet as my daily driver and asked the Assistant to quickly compare something for me or perform multiple tasks at once, the result would often be a bunch of new tabs opening.</p>    <p>My browser is always cluttered as it is, so Opera's approach is exactly what I needed. You can start multiple Tasks simultaneously, and for each one, Neon will maintain its own context and progress. That means you can have one Task comparing product prices, another drafting an email, and a third researching flights, all running independently without interfering with each other.</p>    <h2>
Neon's Cards feature is a smarter way to prompt
</h2><h3>
Automate tasks you perform daily with Cards
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Opera Neon Cards feature" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-13-at-12-24-22-am.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Another feature I haven’t seen in any other AI browser I’ve gone hands-on with is <strong>Cards</strong>, which are pre-built prompt instructions you can mix and match depending on what you’re doing. They're like reusable AI behaviors you can pull from whenever you need.</p>    <p>You can find these pre-built prompts in the Neon Cards section. From what I noticed, there are two different types of Neon Cards: Card and Website Agent. The Card type seems to be generalized prompts that handle broad or task-specific actions, while Website Agents are prompts specifically designed to help your browser navigate and interact with particular websites.</p>    <p>For example, there's a YouTube Card labeled as a Website Agent, and this is the prompt it’s populated with:</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>Use the search bar to find videos, channels, or playlists. Click a video to watch; adjust quality, captions, or playback speed with the player controls. Like, comment, or subscribe to channels. Upload by clicking the camera icon and selecting a file. For sharing, click 'Share' under the video or copy the URL. To make playlists, click 'Save,' then choose or create a playlist. Manage subscriptions from the left menu.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Similarly, there's a movie-night-magic Card that’s not a Website Agent and isn’t specific to a single site. Here’s the prompt it’s populated with:</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>You’re a movie critic. Find the top-rated movies that fit a particular mood and genre. Limit results to those currently available on a major streaming service, and provide a short summary, release year, and critic/audience ratings for each suggestion. Sources to consider: RogerEbert.com, The Guardian, New York Times, Rotten Tomatoes, Letterboxd, Movie Review Query Engine, Cinema Scope.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>You'll find some of the most popular cards in the Spotlight section, and when you scroll a bit, you’ll also find Cards grouped into categories like <strong>Entertainment</strong>, <strong>Finance</strong>, <strong>Fun &amp; Games</strong>, <strong>Lifestyle</strong>, <strong>Travel</strong>, and <strong>Utility</strong>.</p>    <p>There are pages worth of <strong>Cards</strong>, all of which are unique and meant to solve specific problems. A lot of them are genuinely interesting use cases too. For example, a Card under the <strong>Featured Cards</strong> section called priority-matrix is designed to help users decide what to focus on.</p>    <p>Now, while there are plenty of ready-made Cards to pick from, Opera also lets you create your own custom Cards from scratch. For example, I made a prompt to order my daily iced coffee, complete with my preferred shop, order details, and delivery instructions. So, I don’t have to type it out every morning. Once saved as a Card, I can just pull it up whenever I need it.</p>    <h3>
Is Neon worth $19.99/month? I'm not sure
</h3>
<p>As much as I’m enjoying using Neon, my only reservation is the price. It does agentic AI a lot better than the other AI browsers I’ve tested, and it packs plenty of features I haven’t even explored yet. But still, I’m not sure how I feel about paying nearly twenty dollars a month for a browser. Then again, who knows? If Opera keeps improving it at this pace, it might just earn its price tag.</p>]]>

Is Neon worth $19.99/month? I'm not sure
</h3>
<p>As much as I’m enjoying using Neon, my only reservation is the price. It does agentic AI a lot better than the other AI browsers I’ve tested, and it packs plenty of features I haven’t even explored yet. But still, I’m not sure how I feel about paying nearly twenty dollars a month for a browser. Then again, who knows? If Opera keeps improving it at this pace, it might just earn its price tag.</p>]]>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Agentic browsers are the latest trend in the AI world, and honestly, I’m all for it. I’ve never been a fan of companies shoehorning AI into every possible feature, but my stance is simple: if a feature is genuinely useful and actually makes a difference, I’m going to use it.</p>    <p>Though I've tested my fair share of AI browsers and have <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-why-perplexity-comet-has-become-primary-browser" target="_blank">been using Comet as my primary browser</a>, the very first one I tried was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/opera-neon-browser-announcement/" target="_blank">Opera's Neon</a>. Back when I first tried it, it was a concept browser, and I was lucky enough to get the developer build to go hands-on with it.</p>    <p>From the moment I tried it, I was impressed. However, since Neon was still in developer build, I couldn't really make it my daily driver. A few days ago, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/favorite-ai-powered-browser-ready-to-launch/" target="_blank">Opera finally launched Neon officially</a>. Though there’s still a waitlist you need to join to get access, Opera has begun inviting its first batch of users, and I was lucky enough to be among them. I've been using it ever since, and it genuinely feels like Chrome and Comet fused into one.</p>    <h2>
What exactly is Opera Neon, and what can it do?

The best AI browser there currently is

</div>
<p>By now, you've probably understood that Neon is Opera's own "agentic" browser. Though Opera formally announced this browser towards the end of May 2025, the company has been working on agentic AI for the past two years. They first announced Browser Operator, which was an AI agent that could browse and actually <em>do</em> things for you.</p>    <p>Think ordering a pair of socks for you or finding the cheapest ticket to Hawaii and booking it for you. The company then decided to merge this idea into a full-fledged browser experience — and that's how Neon was born. Opera introduced Neon with the hope of "reimagining what a browser can be in the age of intelligence agents."</p>    <p>The end goal here wasn't a browser that'd just have AI tools to summarize a webpage you're browsing or a built-in Chat area where you could quickly ask a word's definition. Instead, Neon is meant to act as a true assistant and is built with agentic AI at its core. Similar to when the browser was first launched, Neon's core functionality comes down to three use cases: <strong>Chat</strong>, <strong>Do</strong>, and <strong>Make</strong>.</p>    <p>Neon is a premium subscription product, and will retail for $19.99/month. As I mentioned above, you can't subscribe just yet and will need to join the waitlist before getting access.</p>    <h2>
Opera Neon's ability to <em>do</em> tasks is what makes it so special
</h2><h3>
Let Neon do all the heavy lifting
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Opera Neon Do booking a flight" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-12-at-11-31-21-pm.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>The idea behind agentic AI browsing is essentially to move beyond passive assistance. Neon's <strong>Do</strong> function is where its entire agentic ability lies, and it’s the feature that allows the browser to act on your behalf, not just guide you.</p>    <p>For example, when I was testing Neon's developer build, the first thing I’d do after opening the browser was quickly switch to <strong>Do</strong> mode and ask it to order my daily iced coffee. I’d include where I wanted to place the order from, what I wanted, and even my address. All I needed to do was prompt it. Neon handled everything from there.</p>    <p>There were times when Neon would still ask for my input, like confirming if I wanted to proceed with payment. If you’ve tried any AI browser with agentic abilities, you might’ve thought, “Hey, I can do the same task faster than the browser.” And while you’re not entirely wrong, you doing it faster than AI isn’t really the point. When an AI agent handles a monotonous task you perform every single day, it frees you up to do something else once you’ve prompted it.</p>    <p>For instance, when Neon would place my coffee order, I'd check my email and calendar. By the time I’m done, my order’s already on its way. That’s the real value of agentic browsing. It takes small, repetitive tasks off your plate so you can focus on things that actually need your attention. In that sense, Neon isn’t trying to outpace you; it’s trying to work with you. And once you get used to that rhythm, it’s hard to go back to a traditional browser that just sits idle, waiting for you to do all the work.</p>    <p>Perplexity’s Comet, which quickly became my go-to browser, also has agentic AI capabilities, but they’re not as polished as Neon’s. I tested Opera Neon and Comet side by side with the same prompt: <em>can you order eggs from [local shop name] for me?</em></p>    <p>By the time Neon was on the checkout page, Comet was stuck resolving an error, and then ended up just telling me how I could order eggs from the website I’d mentioned.</p>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="asking Perplexity Comet to buy eggs for me" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-13-at-12-26-59-am.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Given that Opera’s been working on agentic AI for so long, it’s no surprise that Neon’s Do functionality feels much more refined. I’ve tested both Neon and Comet with a lot more prompts like asking them to compare prices for a specific product, send an email, book a flight, you name it. And in almost every case, Neon handled the task much more smoothly.</p>    <h2>
Neon helps you organize your work with task-specific “mini browsers”
</h2><h3>
No more chaos
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Opera Neon Tabs feature in action" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-13-at-12-24-49-am.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>One Neon feature that's really impressed me in my testing is something Opera calls <strong>Tasks</strong>. It’s an organizational feature that creates dedicated workspaces for whatever you’re working on, and it’s something I’m yet to see implemented in another browser. The way it works is simple. You open a tab (which is your primary Task), and a <strong>plus</strong> button appears next to the search bar, where you can open subtasks related to your main Task.</p>    <p>Each Task functions like a mini browser that understands context, letting the AI analyze, compare, and act across multiple sources within that specific workspace, without mixing it up with everything else you have open. When I used Comet as my daily driver and asked the Assistant to quickly compare something for me or perform multiple tasks at once, the result would often be a bunch of new tabs opening.</p>    <p>My browser is always cluttered as it is, so Opera's approach is exactly what I needed. You can start multiple Tasks simultaneously, and for each one, Neon will maintain its own context and progress. That means you can have one Task comparing product prices, another drafting an email, and a third researching flights, all running independently without interfering with each other.</p>    <h2>
Neon's Cards feature is a smarter way to prompt
</h2><h3>
Automate tasks you perform daily with Cards
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Opera Neon Cards feature" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-13-at-12-24-22-am.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Another feature I haven’t seen in any other AI browser I’ve gone hands-on with is <strong>Cards</strong>, which are pre-built prompt instructions you can mix and match depending on what you’re doing. They're like reusable AI behaviors you can pull from whenever you need.</p>    <p>You can find these pre-built prompts in the Neon Cards section. From what I noticed, there are two different types of Neon Cards: Card and Website Agent. The Card type seems to be generalized prompts that handle broad or task-specific actions, while Website Agents are prompts specifically designed to help your browser navigate and interact with particular websites.</p>    <p>For example, there's a YouTube Card labeled as a Website Agent, and this is the prompt it’s populated with:</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>Use the search bar to find videos, channels, or playlists. Click a video to watch; adjust quality, captions, or playback speed with the player controls. Like, comment, or subscribe to channels. Upload by clicking the camera icon and selecting a file. For sharing, click 'Share' under the video or copy the URL. To make playlists, click 'Save,' then choose or create a playlist. Manage subscriptions from the left menu.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Similarly, there's a movie-night-magic Card that’s not a Website Agent and isn’t specific to a single site. Here’s the prompt it’s populated with:</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>You’re a movie critic. Find the top-rated movies that fit a particular mood and genre. Limit results to those currently available on a major streaming service, and provide a short summary, release year, and critic/audience ratings for each suggestion. Sources to consider: RogerEbert.com, The Guardian, New York Times, Rotten Tomatoes, Letterboxd, Movie Review Query Engine, Cinema Scope.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>You'll find some of the most popular cards in the Spotlight section, and when you scroll a bit, you’ll also find Cards grouped into categories like <strong>Entertainment</strong>, <strong>Finance</strong>, <strong>Fun &amp; Games</strong>, <strong>Lifestyle</strong>, <strong>Travel</strong>, and <strong>Utility</strong>.</p>    <p>There are pages worth of <strong>Cards</strong>, all of which are unique and meant to solve specific problems. A lot of them are genuinely interesting use cases too. For example, a Card under the <strong>Featured Cards</strong> section called priority-matrix is designed to help users decide what to focus on.</p>    <p>Now, while there are plenty of ready-made Cards to pick from, Opera also lets you create your own custom Cards from scratch. For example, I made a prompt to order my daily iced coffee, complete with my preferred shop, order details, and delivery instructions. So, I don’t have to type it out every morning. Once saved as a Card, I can just pull it up whenever I need it.</p>    <h3>

<p>As much as I’m enjoying using Neon, my only reservation is the price.

But still, I’m not sure how I feel about paying nearly twenty dollars a month for a browser. Then again, who knows?

      <![CDATA[<p>Every year, <em>Call of Duty</em> gets hit with the same old complaints. At this point, it's almost like clockwork. "It's the same game again," or "They're milking the brand at this point." However, when a beta drops, we're all guilty of flocking to it, tuning in to see what's new, or, in many cases, <em>because</em> it's the new <em>COD</em> on the block.</p>    <p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>'s beta is another such moment, and this time, the beta is incredible. It's a rare, confident reminder that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-and-modern-warfare-series-ranked/" target="_blank">this long-running series</a> knows when to raise the stakes and polish things to the highest degree, and with its beta's multiplayer showcase, <em>BO7</em> proves that it's the king of shooters, and will certainly be ruling the sales charts come holiday season.</p>    <h2>
The multiplayer beta is just that good
</h2><h3>
The Black Ops 7 beta felt way more impressive than Battlefield 6
</h3>

<p>I've played almost every <em>Call of Duty</em> since the 2009 <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>, and I have to say, <em>Black Ops 7</em>'s beta is more impressive than a lot of betas in the past. The moment I loaded into my first map in <em>BO7</em>, something <em>felt</em> different. The pacing feels perfect — fast, but not chaotic. The gunplay? Crisp and weighty. Even the TTK (time-to-kill), which I honestly had a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/player-complaints-about-battlefield-6-open-beta/" target="_blank">bad taste in my mouth from the <em>Battlefield 6</em> beta</a>, feels like it's been tuned with surgical precision over here in <em>Black Ops 7</em>.</p>    <p>There's a fluidity to the gameplay that is just <em>unmistakably</em> Treyarch. It's a mix of tight control, buttery-smooth animations, and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/the-most-immersive-open-world-maps-ever-created/" target="_blank">map design</a> that lets you play the hero if your aim is up for it. The maps themselves — all five of them in the beta — are rock solid with no duds. The Forge, Exposure, and Imprint had to be my favorites, and their symmetrical nature, when played over hours, really lends to some unforgettable plays you will want gameplay recording on for.</p>    <h2>
The beta showed zero bugs, lag, or nonsense
</h2><h3>
Black Ops 7 is running at an incredible level of polish

<p>Today, it isn't just betas but <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gaming-trends-that-need-to-end-in-2025/" target="_blank">even full game launches</a> that are usually code for "glorified server stress tests." We've all come to expect rubber-banding, crashes, or weapons that break the game entirely. But the <em>Black Ops 7 </em>beta has been practically spotless with no frame drops, no stutters, no disappearing guns, or broken hit detection, all from the word go. Everything just works, which, at this stage, came as a genuinely pleasant surprise.</p>

</div>
</section><p>It's one thing for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/great-visuals-games-without-ray-tracing/" target="_blank">a game to look this good</a>, but it's another to perform this well a full month before launch. The netcode feels tighter, the movement is more grounded, the wall-jumping mechanic doesn't feel or look broken at all, and the killcam's actually... accurate? I don't know what kind of internal QA overhaul Treyarch has pulled off, but it's clearly paying dividends.</p>    <p><em>Call of Duty</em> does seem to be operating in a league of its own when it comes to technical polish, after all. Playing the game with maxed out graphics settings, I got a smooth 60fps experience at native 1440p <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-i-use-nvidia-dlaa-over-dlss/" target="_blank">with NVIDIA DLAA</a>, with a single jump up to DLSS Quality with the Transformer Model to reach 90+ fps with no tearing or gameplay lag. </p>    <h2>
This is peak Call of Duty gameplay with no unnecessary gimmicks

Core gameplay loop polished to perfection

<p>The biggest compliment I can give <em>Black Ops 7</em> is that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer/" target="_blank">it doesn't try too hard</a>. No wall-running, jetpacks, or overdesigned gadgets that change the meta every week. This time, we've got one single wall-jumping mechanic that lends verticality to each map and is incredibly fun to use every single time. Outside that? It's pure, classic, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-1-review-2025-does-it-hold-up/" target="_blank">boots-on-the-ground gunplay</a> at its absolute best. It's the kind of gameplay loop that feels familiar but new.</p>    <p>The weapons hit great, the audio feedback feels fantastic, and the recoil patterns are balanced just enough to reward skill without alienating newcomers. Thankfully, Treyarch seems to understand that innovation <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/sequels-that-put-their-predecessors-to-shame/" target="_blank">doesn't always have to mean reinvention</a>, and sometimes, just refinement can work wonders. </p>    <h2>
Black Ops 7 will inarguably sell like hotcakes

<p>Here's the truth: for all the talk about campaigns — <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-will-disappoint-single-player-gamers/" target="_blank">a lot of which I did myself</a> — what sells <em>Call of Duty</em> is the multiplayer. It's the game mode that keeps you grinding for hours every night and even longer on weekends for an entire year before the next one rolls around. Always has, always will. And this beta is the ultimate proof of that. It's the part of the experience that keeps players coming back every night, long after the campaign credits have rolled, and regardless of what kind of taste it left in their mouth.</p>

<div><p>This is the kind of beta that fuels word-of-mouth.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p><em>Black Ops 7</em> doesn't even need a lot of marketing stunts or cross-media hype cycles. The brand speaks volumes for itself and then some, and even more when you drop into a match. This is the kind of beta that fuels word-of-mouth, because I just made my own friends decide to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-dutys-new-black-ops-7-trailer-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">hold off on their <em>Battlefield 6 </em>purchases</a> to instead save that money for November, when <em>Black Ops 7</em> rolls around — we'd be able to relive 2020 pandemic-era <em>MW1 </em>multiplayer, along with zombies mode for an entire year for the $70 price tag.</p>    <p>Plus, every <em>Call of Duty</em> title has always managed to sell incredibly well, despite any criticisms or problems that players or media may have with them. Outside the horrifying misfire that was <a href="https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-warzone-how-use-mw3-mw2-weapons/" target="_blank">the <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> remake</a>, it's tough to recall any <em>COD </em>title in recent history that didn't sell well, no matter what anyone had to say, and it's all because of one simple reason — it's the Christmas gift. The title anyone picks up for their niece or nephew. The no-brainer, $70 gift that will make them the favorite aunt or uncle. And with the game being this polished? There's just no denying that it <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-beta-made-me-revisit-battlefield-2042/" target="_blank">will outsell <em>Battlefield 6</em></a>, which, honestly, is the strongest that franchise has been in a decade. </p>

Battlefield's best-ever will still be outshined by BO7

<div><p>Battlefield 6 needed Black Ops 7 to be downright unplayable to win the 2025 holiday shooter award.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Battlefield Studios and DICE have clearly thrown everything at the wall with <em>Battlefield 6</em> to create what is inarguably one of the best <em>Battlefield </em>games of all time. The multiplayer is incredible, the large-scale maps are brilliant as ever, the gameplay and performance are polished to perfection, and they've even thrown in some smaller maps to lure in the <em>Call of Duty </em>crowd. </p>    <p>Still, the one thing <em>Battlefield 6</em> truly needed to win the holiday shooter war against <em>Call of Duty </em>this year was for <em>Black Ops 7 </em>to be downright unplayable. Since that is far from the case now, DICE's efforts will certainly result in one of the best-selling and highest-rated <em>Battlefield </em>games in recent memory. Will it manage to outsell <em>Black Ops 7</em>, though? I'd bet money on that not happening — $70, to be precise.</p>]]>

    <description>
      <![CDATA[<p>Every year, <em>Call of Duty</em> gets hit with the same old complaints. At this point, it's almost like clockwork. "It's the same game again," or "They're milking the brand at this point." However, when a beta drops, we're all guilty of flocking to it, tuning in to see what's new, or, in many cases, <em>because</em> it's the new <em>COD</em> on the block.</p>    <p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>'s beta is another such moment, and this time, the beta is incredible. It's a rare, confident reminder that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-and-modern-warfare-series-ranked/" target="_blank">this long-running series</a> knows when to raise the stakes and polish things to the highest degree, and with its beta's multiplayer showcase, <em>BO7</em> proves that it's the king of shooters, and will certainly be ruling the sales charts come holiday season.</p>    <h2>
The multiplayer beta is just that good
</h2><h3>
The Black Ops 7 beta felt way more impressive than Battlefield 6

<p>I've played almost every <em>Call of Duty</em> since the 2009 <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>, and I have to say, <em>Black Ops 7</em>'s beta is more impressive than a lot of betas in the past. The moment I loaded into my first map in <em>BO7</em>, something <em>felt</em> different. The pacing feels perfect — fast, but not chaotic. The gunplay? Crisp and weighty. Even the TTK (time-to-kill), which I honestly had a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/player-complaints-about-battlefield-6-open-beta/" target="_blank">bad taste in my mouth from the <em>Battlefield 6</em> beta</a>, feels like it's been tuned with surgical precision over here in <em>Black Ops 7</em>.</p>    <p>There's a fluidity to the gameplay that is just <em>unmistakably</em> Treyarch. It's a mix of tight control, buttery-smooth animations, and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/the-most-immersive-open-world-maps-ever-created/" target="_blank">map design</a> that lets you play the hero if your aim is up for it. The maps themselves — all five of them in the beta — are rock solid with no duds. The Forge, Exposure, and Imprint had to be my favorites, and their symmetrical nature, when played over hours, really lends to some unforgettable plays you will want gameplay recording on for.</p>    <h2>
The beta showed zero bugs, lag, or nonsense
</h2><h3>
Black Ops 7 is running at an incredible level of polish

<p>Today, it isn't just betas but <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gaming-trends-that-need-to-end-in-2025/" target="_blank">even full game launches</a> that are usually code for "glorified server stress tests." We've all come to expect rubber-banding, crashes, or weapons that break the game entirely. But the <em>Black Ops 7 </em>beta has been practically spotless with no frame drops, no stutters, no disappearing guns, or broken hit detection, all from the word go. Everything just works, which, at this stage, came as a genuinely pleasant surprise.</p>

</div>
</section><p>It's one thing for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/great-visuals-games-without-ray-tracing/" target="_blank">a game to look this good</a>, but it's another to perform this well a full month before launch. The netcode feels tighter, the movement is more grounded, the wall-jumping mechanic doesn't feel or look broken at all, and the killcam's actually... accurate? I don't know what kind of internal QA overhaul Treyarch has pulled off, but it's clearly paying dividends.</p>    <p><em>Call of Duty</em> does seem to be operating in a league of its own when it comes to technical polish, after all. Playing the game with maxed out graphics settings, I got a smooth 60fps experience at native 1440p <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-i-use-nvidia-dlaa-over-dlss/" target="_blank">with NVIDIA DLAA</a>, with a single jump up to DLSS Quality with the Transformer Model to reach 90+ fps with no tearing or gameplay lag. </p>    <h2>
This is peak Call of Duty gameplay with no unnecessary gimmicks
</h2><h3>
Core gameplay loop polished to perfection

<p>The biggest compliment I can give <em>Black Ops 7</em> is that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer/" target="_blank">it doesn't try too hard</a>. No wall-running, jetpacks, or overdesigned gadgets that change the meta every week. This time, we've got one single wall-jumping mechanic that lends verticality to each map and is incredibly fun to use every single time. Outside that? It's pure, classic, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-1-review-2025-does-it-hold-up/" target="_blank">boots-on-the-ground gunplay</a> at its absolute best. It's the kind of gameplay loop that feels familiar but new.</p>    <p>The weapons hit great, the audio feedback feels fantastic, and the recoil patterns are balanced just enough to reward skill without alienating newcomers. Thankfully, Treyarch seems to understand that innovation <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/sequels-that-put-their-predecessors-to-shame/" target="_blank">doesn't always have to mean reinvention</a>, and sometimes, just refinement can work wonders. </p>    <h2>
Black Ops 7 will inarguably sell like hotcakes

<p>Here's the truth: for all the talk about campaigns — <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-will-disappoint-single-player-gamers/" target="_blank">a lot of which I did myself</a> — what sells <em>Call of Duty</em> is the multiplayer. It's the game mode that keeps you grinding for hours every night and even longer on weekends for an entire year before the next one rolls around. Always has, always will. And this beta is the ultimate proof of that. It's the part of the experience that keeps players coming back every night, long after the campaign credits have rolled, and regardless of what kind of taste it left in their mouth.</p>

<div><p>This is the kind of beta that fuels word-of-mouth.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p><em>Black Ops 7</em> doesn't even need a lot of marketing stunts or cross-media hype cycles. The brand speaks volumes for itself and then some, and even more when you drop into a match. This is the kind of beta that fuels word-of-mouth, because I just made my own friends decide to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-dutys-new-black-ops-7-trailer-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">hold off on their <em>Battlefield 6 </em>purchases</a> to instead save that money for November, when <em>Black Ops 7</em> rolls around — we'd be able to relive 2020 pandemic-era <em>MW1 </em>multiplayer, along with zombies mode for an entire year for the $70 price tag.</p>    <p>Plus, every <em>Call of Duty</em> title has always managed to sell incredibly well, despite any criticisms or problems that players or media may have with them. Outside the horrifying misfire that was <a href="https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-warzone-how-use-mw3-mw2-weapons/" target="_blank">the <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> remake</a>, it's tough to recall any <em>COD </em>title in recent history that didn't sell well, no matter what anyone had to say, and it's all because of one simple reason — it's the Christmas gift. The title anyone picks up for their niece or nephew. The no-brainer, $70 gift that will make them the favorite aunt or uncle. And with the game being this polished? There's just no denying that it <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-beta-made-me-revisit-battlefield-2042/" target="_blank">will outsell <em>Battlefield 6</em></a>, which, honestly, is the strongest that franchise has been in a decade. </p>

<div><p>Battlefield 6 needed Black Ops 7 to be downright unplayable to win the 2025 holiday shooter award.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Battlefield Studios and DICE have clearly thrown everything at the wall with <em>Battlefield 6</em> to create what is inarguably one of the best <em>Battlefield </em>games of all time. The multiplayer is incredible, the large-scale maps are brilliant as ever, the gameplay and performance are polished to perfection, and they've even thrown in some smaller maps to lure in the <em>Call of Duty </em>crowd. </p>    <p>Still, the one thing <em>Battlefield 6</em> truly needed to win the holiday shooter war against <em>Call of Duty </em>this year was for <em>Black Ops 7 </em>to be downright unplayable. Since that is far from the case now, DICE's efforts will certainly result in one of the best-selling and highest-rated <em>Battlefield </em>games in recent memory. Will it manage to outsell <em>Black Ops 7</em>, though? I'd bet money on that not happening — $70, to be precise.</p>]]>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year, <em>Call of Duty</em> gets hit with the same old complaints. At this point, it's almost like clockwork. "It's the same game again," or "They're milking the brand at this point." However, when a beta drops, we're all guilty of flocking to it, tuning in to see what's new, or, in many cases, <em>because</em> it's the new <em>COD</em> on the block.</p>    <p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>'s beta is another such moment, and this time, the beta is incredible. It's a rare, confident reminder that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-and-modern-warfare-series-ranked/" target="_blank">this long-running series</a> knows when to raise the stakes and polish things to the highest degree, and with its beta's multiplayer showcase, <em>BO7</em> proves that it's the king of shooters, and will certainly be ruling the sales charts come holiday season.</p>    <h2>
The multiplayer beta is just that good
</h2><h3>
The Black Ops 7 beta felt way more impressive than Battlefield 6

<p>I've played almost every <em>Call of Duty</em> since the 2009 <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>, and I have to say, <em>Black Ops 7</em>'s beta is more impressive than a lot of betas in the past. The moment I loaded into my first map in <em>BO7</em>, something <em>felt</em> different. The pacing feels perfect — fast, but not chaotic. The gunplay? Crisp and weighty. Even the TTK (time-to-kill), which I honestly had a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/player-complaints-about-battlefield-6-open-beta/" target="_blank">bad taste in my mouth from the <em>Battlefield 6</em> beta</a>, feels like it's been tuned with surgical precision over here in <em>Black Ops 7</em>.</p>    <p>There's a fluidity to the gameplay that is just <em>unmistakably</em> Treyarch. It's a mix of tight control, buttery-smooth animations, and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/the-most-immersive-open-world-maps-ever-created/" target="_blank">map design</a> that lets you play the hero if your aim is up for it. The maps themselves — all five of them in the beta — are rock solid with no duds. The Forge, Exposure, and Imprint had to be my favorites, and their symmetrical nature, when played over hours, really lends to some unforgettable plays you will want gameplay recording on for.</p>    <h2>
The beta showed zero bugs, lag, or nonsense
</h2><h3>
Black Ops 7 is running at an incredible level of polish

<p>Today, it isn't just betas but <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gaming-trends-that-need-to-end-in-2025/" target="_blank">even full game launches</a> that are usually code for "glorified server stress tests." We've all come to expect rubber-banding, crashes, or weapons that break the game entirely. But the <em>Black Ops 7 </em>beta has been practically spotless with no frame drops, no stutters, no disappearing guns, or broken hit detection, all from the word go. Everything just works, which, at this stage, came as a genuinely pleasant surprise.</p>

<div><p><em>Call of Duty</em> seems to be operating in a league of its own when it comes to technical polish.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>It's one thing for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/great-visuals-games-without-ray-tracing/" target="_blank">a game to look this good</a>, but it's another to perform this well a full month before launch. The netcode feels tighter, the movement is more grounded, the wall-jumping mechanic doesn't feel or look broken at all, and the killcam's actually... accurate? I don't know what kind of internal QA overhaul Treyarch has pulled off, but it's clearly paying dividends.</p>    <p><em>Call of Duty</em> does seem to be operating in a league of its own when it comes to technical polish, after all. Playing the game with maxed out graphics settings, I got a smooth 60fps experience at native 1440p <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-i-use-nvidia-dlaa-over-dlss/" target="_blank">with NVIDIA DLAA</a>, with a single jump up to DLSS Quality with the Transformer Model to reach 90+ fps with no tearing or gameplay lag. </p>    <h2>
This is peak Call of Duty gameplay with no unnecessary gimmicks
</h2><h3>
Core gameplay loop polished to perfection

<p>The biggest compliment I can give <em>Black Ops 7</em> is that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer/" target="_blank">it doesn't try too hard</a>. No wall-running, jetpacks, or overdesigned gadgets that change the meta every week. This time, we've got one single wall-jumping mechanic that lends verticality to each map and is incredibly fun to use every single time. Outside that? It's pure, classic, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-1-review-2025-does-it-hold-up/" target="_blank">boots-on-the-ground gunplay</a> at its absolute best. It's the kind of gameplay loop that feels familiar but new.</p>    <p>The weapons hit great, the audio feedback feels fantastic, and the recoil patterns are balanced just enough to reward skill without alienating newcomers. Thankfully, Treyarch seems to understand that innovation <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/sequels-that-put-their-predecessors-to-shame/" target="_blank">doesn't always have to mean reinvention</a>, and sometimes, just refinement can work wonders. </p>    <h2>
Black Ops 7 will inarguably sell like hotcakes

Despite its campaign's possible problems, the bulk of the player base is here for the MP

<p>Here's the truth: for all the talk about campaigns — <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-will-disappoint-single-player-gamers/" target="_blank">a lot of which I did myself</a> — what sells <em>Call of Duty</em> is the multiplayer. It's the game mode that keeps you grinding for hours every night and even longer on weekends for an entire year before the next one rolls around. Always has, always will. And this beta is the ultimate proof of that. It's the part of the experience that keeps players coming back every night, long after the campaign credits have rolled, and regardless of what kind of taste it left in their mouth.</p>

<div><p>This is the kind of beta that fuels word-of-mouth.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p><em>Black Ops 7</em> doesn't even need a lot of marketing stunts or cross-media hype cycles. The brand speaks volumes for itself and then some, and even more when you drop into a match. This is the kind of beta that fuels word-of-mouth, because I just made my own friends decide to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-dutys-new-black-ops-7-trailer-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">hold off on their <em>Battlefield 6 </em>purchases</a> to instead save that money for November, when <em>Black Ops 7</em> rolls around — we'd be able to relive 2020 pandemic-era <em>MW1 </em>multiplayer, along with zombies mode for an entire year for the $70 price tag.</p>    <p>Plus, every <em>Call of Duty</em> title has always managed to sell incredibly well, despite any criticisms or problems that players or media may have with them. Outside the horrifying misfire that was <a href="https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-warzone-how-use-mw3-mw2-weapons/" target="_blank">the <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> remake</a>, it's tough to recall any <em>COD </em>title in recent history that didn't sell well, no matter what anyone had to say, and it's all because of one simple reason — it's the Christmas gift. The title anyone picks up for their niece or nephew. The no-brainer, $70 gift that will make them the favorite aunt or uncle. And with the game being this polished? There's just no denying that it <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-beta-made-me-revisit-battlefield-2042/" target="_blank">will outsell <em>Battlefield 6</em></a>, which, honestly, is the strongest that franchise has been in a decade. </p>

Battlefield's best-ever will still be outshined by BO7

</div>
</section><p>Battlefield Studios and DICE have clearly thrown everything at the wall with <em>Battlefield 6</em> to create what is inarguably one of the best <em>Battlefield </em>games of all time. The multiplayer is incredible, the large-scale maps are brilliant as ever, the gameplay and performance are polished to perfection, and they've even thrown in some smaller maps to lure in the <em>Call of Duty </em>crowd. </p>    <p>Still, the one thing <em>Battlefield 6</em> truly needed to win the holiday shooter war against <em>Call of Duty </em>this year was for <em>Black Ops 7 </em>to be downright unplayable. Since that is far from the case now, DICE's efforts will certainly result in one of the best-selling and highest-rated <em>Battlefield </em>games in recent memory. Will it manage to outsell <em>Black Ops 7</em>, though? I'd bet money on that not happening — $70, to be precise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>What began as a quick dabble into Jellyfin earlier this year has become a rabbit hole. Because I’m still green when it comes to self-hosting media servers, every step requires a Google search or two. Still, between learning about server configurations, codec options, and auxiliary tools like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ffmpeg-commands-to-replace-basic-post-production-tools/" target="_blank">FFmpeg</a>, I’ve been wondering if there’s a better alternative to Jellyfin’s default web player.</p>    <p>As it turns out, there are plenty. The default web browser is good enough for basic viewing, but the experience can be vastly improved with an external player. Here are just a few that worked best for me.</p>    <h2>
Jellyfin Media Player
</h2><h3>
First party is the best party
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1414572979" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1414572979" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1414572979" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1414572979" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1414572979-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Anything you can do on the Jellyfin web, including managing server settings, libraries, and users, you can do through the Jellyfin Media Player. As Jellyfin's official desktop client, built on the mighty MPV, the Jellyfin Media Player carries the familiar interface of its web-based counterpart. Using MPV as its foundation also brings support for almost any codec under the sun. Additionally, with a bit of tweaking to its config files, it can be integrated with plugins like the SmoothVideo Project, which can boost the video frame rate to 60 frames per second.</p>    <h2>
Jellyfin MPV Shim
</h2><h3>
A great cast-only option
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1341937087" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1341937087" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1341937087" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1341937087" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1341937087-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Before there was Jellyfin Media Player, Jellyfin MPV Shim was likely the most popular way to watch Jellyfin videos, and some still swear by it today. It has a heck of a clunky interface (such is the case with many useful open-source tools). But don't let its appearance fool you; it’s one of the most powerful cast-only media players for Jellyfin.</p>    <p>Like the Jellyfin Media Player, MPV Shim is also built on the MPV player. That means it offers excellent playback and codec support, as well as advanced options such as shader support and SVP. For playback controls, there’s a long list of handy keyboard shortcuts to access adjustments quickly. Despite its <a href="http://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-mpv-shim#configuration" target="_blank">incredible customization</a>, if you’d rather not tinker, it installs in a few clicks and works great with the default settings. All of its features are stuffed into a package that weighs around just 40 megabytes on Windows.</p>    <p>It has a few limitations, though. Jellyfin MPV Shim doesn’t currently support Live TV playback (I wanted to use it with my recently created<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/youtube-video-tv-channel-on-jellyfin/" target="_blank"> local TV channel</a>, no luck). Since it’s built for video, MPV Shim’s music player is also wonky, omitting basic features like shuffling. As the devs explained on the GitHub page, music playback was never the focus, and these features can't be implemented without significant app overhauls. These flaws are still far from dealbreakers and can be mitigated by installing a second player for music or TV.</p>    <p>During my testing, one issue I ran into is that even when streaming a video format compatible with Direct Play — in my case, a 1080p H.264 SDR MP4 file — Jellyfin MPV Shim still uses Transcode mode, meaning the video needs to be converted into a supported format during playback, potentially causing the stutters and lags I saw during my testing.</p>    <h2>
VLC media player
</h2><h3>
The ol' reliable workhorse in media playback
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A screenshot of VLC playing a smartphone comparison video sourced from Jellyfin." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/xda-vlc-jellyfin.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<figcaption>The only drawback with using VLC is that I need to paste in the video stream URL for every video I want to watch from Jellyfin. Otherwise, it runs great!</figcaption>
</div>
</div>
<p> The venerated VLC media player has been a staple on my system for years. As powerful as it is, it doesn’t integrate directly with Jellyfin like MPV Shim on desktop. Instead, I can get it to play the videos by pasting their stream links into VLC’s remote connection settings. It isn’t the most intuitive option because I have to paste in a new link for every video I want to watch. Still, if I’m accessing the server from another device without the other media players, it can be a great backup option.</p>    <h2>
Jellyfin for Android

<p>The official Jellyfin app has come a long way since its rocky release. Its features and performance now rank it among the top Jellyfin media players on Android. Besides media playback, the Jellyfin mobile app also gives me access to the full server dashboard, so I can manage my media library from my phone.</p>    <p>As for playback, it actually includes two media players: an HTML media player and one based on ExoPlayer. When they lack native support for a codec, I can set the app to launch an external player, like Findroid or VLC Media Player, to cover all bases. Still, it would be great if it could integrate MPV in the future.</p>    <p>In addition to its clean interface, the Jellyfin app offers helpful features such as background play (continued playback with the screen off), gesture controls, streaming quality controls, casting options, and more than enough other settings to keep most users happy.</p>    <p>Unfortunately, the Jellyfin app for iOS doesn’t offer the same level of polish. Its barren settings page only includes basic customizations for playback and appearance, omitting subtitle adjustments, decoding options, and other key features available in the Android and web clients.</p>    <h2>

<p>Findroid has one big advantage over the current Jellyfin app: it supports an experimental version of MPV. Its simple interface arguably looks better than the Jellyfin app, but its lack of features like background play and streaming quality selection during playback is too inconvenient. That said, I did find its option to disable touch while playing useful, particularly when I have wet hands. It’s worth installing as a backup to the Jellyfin app.</p>    <h2>
Infuse
</h2><h3>
Powerful iOS option, but carries a subscription cost for premium features
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-5-1405899386" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-5-1405899386" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-5-1405899386" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-5-1405899386" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-5-1405899386-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>With the iOS Jellyfin app in a questionable state, Infuse rises to fill the void. Compared to the Jellyfin app, it has a vastly superior interface and customization options for artwork, file management, metadata fetching, subtitles, and more. It even has an option for in-app AI upscaling. Though its codec support doesn’t seem as robust as the other players, it sufficiently covers most common media types. Jellyfin support is only a small part of what Infuse can do; it also works with Emby, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/common-plex-issues-on-nas-and-how-to-fix-them/" target="_blank">Plex</a>, cloud videos, and NAS setups.</p>    <p>In my testing, the media player handled all my files without a hiccup. However, some video formats, iCloud sync, and support for high-res Dolby and DTS-HD audio are locked behind a subscription, starting at $2.29 a month at the time of writing.</p>    <h2>
Streamyfin
</h2><h3>
A free alternative to Infuse on iOS
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-6-2065536488" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-6-2065536488" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-6-2065536488" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-6-2065536488" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-6-2065536488-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Infuse isn’t the only option in the Apple App Store. Streamyfin is simpler yet still offers all the core options and fantastic playback stability. Unlike Infuse, Streamyfin is open source but is designed solely for Jellyfin.</p>    <p>For the price of zero dollars, Streamyfin brings a full basket of settings for playback quality and subtitle mode, and even offers a dead zone in video controls. Users who manage their libraries using the Jellyseerr management tool can connect it directly with Streamyfin. It does lack features like automatic metadata sourcing, but I really can’t argue against the price of free.</p>    <h3>
There are more choices out there
</h3>
<p>A quick search for “Jellyfin player” in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store yields dozens of results. Due to time constraints, my list includes only the options that worked best for me as I stumbled through learning about self-hosted media servers. For example, a popular option I couldn’t test was Swiftfin for iOS; it stubbornly refused to connect to my server. If you love a specific Jellyfin app or setup, share it in the comments! Both I and other users will appreciate it.</p>]]>

<p>The official Jellyfin app has come a long way since its rocky release. Its features and performance now rank it among the top Jellyfin media players on Android. Besides media playback, the Jellyfin mobile app also gives me access to the full server dashboard, so I can manage my media library from my phone.</p>    <p>As for playback, it actually includes two media players: an HTML media player and one based on ExoPlayer. When they lack native support for a codec, I can set the app to launch an external player, like Findroid or VLC Media Player, to cover all bases. Still, it would be great if it could integrate MPV in the future.</p>    <p>In addition to its clean interface, the Jellyfin app offers helpful features such as background play (continued playback with the screen off), gesture controls, streaming quality controls, casting options, and more than enough other settings to keep most users happy.</p>    <p>Unfortunately, the Jellyfin app for iOS doesn’t offer the same level of polish. Its barren settings page only includes basic customizations for playback and appearance, omitting subtitle adjustments, decoding options, and other key features available in the Android and web clients.</p>    <h2>

<p>Findroid has one big advantage over the current Jellyfin app: it supports an experimental version of MPV. Its simple interface arguably looks better than the Jellyfin app, but its lack of features like background play and streaming quality selection during playback is too inconvenient. That said, I did find its option to disable touch while playing useful, particularly when I have wet hands. It’s worth installing as a backup to the Jellyfin app.</p>    <h2>

<p>With the iOS Jellyfin app in a questionable state, Infuse rises to fill the void. Compared to the Jellyfin app, it has a vastly superior interface and customization options for artwork, file management, metadata fetching, subtitles, and more. It even has an option for in-app AI upscaling. Though its codec support doesn’t seem as robust as the other players, it sufficiently covers most common media types. Jellyfin support is only a small part of what Infuse can do; it also works with Emby, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/common-plex-issues-on-nas-and-how-to-fix-them/" target="_blank">Plex</a>, cloud videos, and NAS setups.</p>    <p>In my testing, the media player handled all my files without a hiccup.

<p>Infuse isn’t the only option in the Apple App Store. Streamyfin is simpler yet still offers all the core options and fantastic playback stability. Unlike Infuse, Streamyfin is open source but is designed solely for Jellyfin.</p>    <p>For the price of zero dollars, Streamyfin brings a full basket of settings for playback quality and subtitle mode, and even offers a dead zone in video controls. Users who manage their libraries using the Jellyseerr management tool can connect it directly with Streamyfin. It does lack features like automatic metadata sourcing, but I really can’t argue against the price of free.</p>    <h3>

<p>A quick search for “Jellyfin player” in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store yields dozens of results. Due to time constraints, my list includes only the options that worked best for me as I stumbled through learning about self-hosted media servers. For example, a popular option I couldn’t test was Swiftfin for iOS; it stubbornly refused to connect to my server. If you love a specific Jellyfin app or setup, share it in the comments! Both I and other users will appreciate it.</p>]]>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What began as a quick dabble into Jellyfin earlier this year has become a rabbit hole. Because I’m still green when it comes to self-hosting media servers, every step requires a Google search or two. Still, between learning about server configurations, codec options, and auxiliary tools like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ffmpeg-commands-to-replace-basic-post-production-tools/" target="_blank">FFmpeg</a>, I’ve been wondering if there’s a better alternative to Jellyfin’s default web player.</p>    <p>As it turns out, there are plenty. The default web browser is good enough for basic viewing, but the experience can be vastly improved with an external player. Here are just a few that worked best for me.</p>    <h2>
Jellyfin Media Player
</h2><h3>
First party is the best party
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1414572979" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1414572979" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1414572979" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1414572979" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1414572979-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Anything you can do on the Jellyfin web, including managing server settings, libraries, and users, you can do through the Jellyfin Media Player. As Jellyfin's official desktop client, built on the mighty MPV, the Jellyfin Media Player carries the familiar interface of its web-based counterpart. Using MPV as its foundation also brings support for almost any codec under the sun. Additionally, with a bit of tweaking to its config files, it can be integrated with plugins like the SmoothVideo Project, which can boost the video frame rate to 60 frames per second.</p>    <h2>
Jellyfin MPV Shim
</h2><h3>
A great cast-only option
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1341937087" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1341937087" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1341937087" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1341937087" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1341937087-img" data-gallery-type="">

<p>Before there was Jellyfin Media Player, Jellyfin MPV Shim was likely the most popular way to watch Jellyfin videos, and some still swear by it today. It has a heck of a clunky interface (such is the case with many useful open-source tools). But don't let its appearance fool you; it’s one of the most powerful cast-only media players for Jellyfin.</p>    <p>Like the Jellyfin Media Player, MPV Shim is also built on the MPV player. That means it offers excellent playback and codec support, as well as advanced options such as shader support and SVP. For playback controls, there’s a long list of handy keyboard shortcuts to access adjustments quickly. Despite its <a href="http://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-mpv-shim#configuration" target="_blank">incredible customization</a>, if you’d rather not tinker, it installs in a few clicks and works great with the default settings. All of its features are stuffed into a package that weighs around just 40 megabytes on Windows.</p>    <p>It has a few limitations, though. Jellyfin MPV Shim doesn’t currently support Live TV playback (I wanted to use it with my recently created<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/youtube-video-tv-channel-on-jellyfin/" target="_blank"> local TV channel</a>, no luck). Since it’s built for video, MPV Shim’s music player is also wonky, omitting basic features like shuffling. As the devs explained on the GitHub page, music playback was never the focus, and these features can't be implemented without significant app overhauls. These flaws are still far from dealbreakers and can be mitigated by installing a second player for music or TV.</p>    <p>During my testing, one issue I ran into is that even when streaming a video format compatible with Direct Play — in my case, a 1080p H.264 SDR MP4 file — Jellyfin MPV Shim still uses Transcode mode, meaning the video needs to be converted into a supported format during playback, potentially causing the stutters and lags I saw during my testing.</p>    <h2>
VLC media player
</h2><h3>
The ol' reliable workhorse in media playback
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A screenshot of VLC playing a smartphone comparison video sourced from Jellyfin." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/xda-vlc-jellyfin.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<figcaption>The only drawback with using VLC is that I need to paste in the video stream URL for every video I want to watch from Jellyfin. Otherwise, it runs great!</figcaption>
</div>
</div>
<p> The venerated VLC media player has been a staple on my system for years. As powerful as it is, it doesn’t integrate directly with Jellyfin like MPV Shim on desktop. Instead, I can get it to play the videos by pasting their stream links into VLC’s remote connection settings. It isn’t the most intuitive option because I have to paste in a new link for every video I want to watch. Still, if I’m accessing the server from another device without the other media players, it can be a great backup option.</p>    <h2>

<p>I wanted a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/unusual-linux-distros-built-one-purpose-why-you-should-try-them/" target="_blank">safe environment to explore</a> how different services reacted to the loss of connectivity.

<p>Most of the work was done using basic Linux utilities. I relied on <strong>tc</strong> to introduce artificial latency and packet loss, while <strong>iptables</strong> and <strong>nftables</strong> managed selective blocking of outbound traffic. The combination enabled me to model a range of conditions, from high latency to complete disconnection. Because these tools are already part of the kernel, I could experiment safely without adding new dependencies.</p>    <p>Network namespaces provided isolation between experiments. I used them to create virtual environments that could be broken without affecting the rest of the network. When something went wrong, deleting a namespace restored connectivity immediately. This method also made it possible to run multiple failure scenarios in parallel and observe how different systems reacted.</p>    <p>To test application-level responses, I created lightweight containers that acted as fake upstream services. Some responded slowly, while others refused connections entirely. Using these stubs, I could examine retry behavior, timeout handling, and overall fault tolerance in a realistic way. Every test was logged, and cleanup scripts ensured no settings lingered between sessions.</p>    <h2>

<p>Even with planning, unexpected issues surfaced quickly. Kernel state sometimes persisted after tests, leaving partial rules behind that blocked legitimate traffic. That residual configuration caused several confusing hours of downtime until I automated the teardown process. Once I implemented a complete cleanup routine, the tests became much more predictable.</p>    <p>Another surprise came from how poorly some services handled temporary failure. Retry storms overloaded upstream systems as soon as connectivity returned, amplifying the very outages I wanted to prevent. I fixed that by tuning retry intervals and adding jitter to backoff algorithms, which spread out the reconnect attempts. This simple change eliminated unnecessary load and smoothed recovery.</p>    <p>Monitoring and alerting also needed serious adjustment. Some alerts never fired, while others flooded me with irrelevant warnings. I rewrote several rules to trigger only after sustained failures and organized them by probable root cause.

<p>There are valid reasons most administrators avoid running chaotic experiments. Simulating failures in a live network carries a real risk of data loss and user disruption. Vendors often recommend formal chaos engineering frameworks with strict controls, rollback mechanisms, and monitoring safeguards. These systems ensure that each test is deliberate and reversible, which my first attempts were not.</p>    <p>Some professionals argue that lab results cannot fully replicate production behavior. Real networks include unpredictable traffic, hardware quirks, and concurrent workloads that are hard to model. A failure scenario in a lab might look clean but behave entirely differently when thousands of users are involved. I now see the merit in starting with lab simulations, but treating them as training, rather than validation.</p>    <p>For individuals running home labs, the boundary between safe testing and reckless experimentation is thin. The key is containment. Keep destructive testing inside virtualized networks or hosts you fully control. Never direct fault injections toward upstream providers or any shared infrastructure, and document every step so recovery remains possible even if things go sideways.</p>    <h2>

<p>Simulating outages is valuable when the goal is to strengthen internal processes. It helps you verify alert accuracy, backup readiness, and recovery automation without depending on a real disaster. For solo home lab users, these controlled experiments can highlight weaknesses early and improve overall system stability. They also provide a sense of confidence that is difficult to gain from passive observation.</p>    <p>There are times, however, when it becomes counterproductive. If your tests begin disrupting unrelated devices, you have crossed a line. I once broke remote backups that relied on my network simply because I forgot they shared the same gateway. Limiting scope and defining clear boundaries prevent those incidents and keep experimentation ethical.</p>    <p>It is also important to consider the needs of other users. If family members or coworkers share your connection, surprise network tests are not fair to them. Schedule downtime windows or perform tests on isolated hardware when possible. Respect for others ensures your learning process does not come at someone else’s expense.</p>    <h2>
Practical checklist and key tools for safe testing

Steps to plan, run, and recover from outages
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="kali linux on a monitor" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/06/kali-linux-featured.JPG?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Define your scope before touching anything. Identify which systems will be affected and confirm that they are under your control.
</li>
<li>
Automate both setup and teardown. Scripts prevent human error and make each run consistent.
</li>
<li>
Start with mocks and virtual networks instead of production services.
</li>
<li>
Configure retries and backoff strategies before testing to avoid storm effects.
</li>
<li>
Document every test, note what broke, and record the fixes for future reference.
</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps turned my chaotic experiments into repeatable drills. Having a structured plan gave me confidence that I could recover quickly. It also helped me compare results between runs and measure improvement over time.</p>    <h3>
Commands and utilities I found most useful
</h3>
<p>The command <strong>tc</strong> remains the best tool for simulating latency and packet loss. An abbreviation for “traffic control,” <strong>tc</strong> lets you control delay, jitter, and drop rates with precise timing. Network namespaces isolate failures safely, while <strong>iptables</strong> or <strong>nftables</strong> handle selective blocking of ports or destinations. I used <strong>dnsmasq</strong> for DNS failures and small HTTP containers for mock services. Together, these components covered nearly every failure mode I wanted to study.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>These tools aren't the only ones available for such simulations, and I won't even argue they're the best ones. They are, however, robust and suit this sort of purpose quite well. Whatever tools you use, the biggest takeaway from this experiment is that comprehensive documentation is your best friend for network disaster recovery. </p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>I also tracked key metrics during tests to measure effectiveness. Alert response times, recovery durations, retry counts, and false positive rates revealed where my automation needed improvement. Monitoring these metrics transformed each test from a random experiment into a measurable improvement exercise. Over time, I saw evident progress in both detection speed and recovery reliability.</p>    <h2>
What I ultimately learned from breaking my network
</h2><p>Simulating outages in my lab gave me a realistic view of how fragile my systems could be. The process exposed hidden dependencies, unreliable retry logic, and weaknesses in my alerting setup. Each controlled failure led to an improvement in how I build and maintain services. While I would not recommend reckless testing, a thoughtful approach can make your network far more resilient than it was before.</p>]]>

<p>Even with planning, unexpected issues surfaced quickly. Kernel state sometimes persisted after tests, leaving partial rules behind that blocked legitimate traffic. That residual configuration caused several confusing hours of downtime until I automated the teardown process. Once I implemented a complete cleanup routine, the tests became much more predictable.</p>    <p>Another surprise came from how poorly some services handled temporary failure. Retry storms overloaded upstream systems as soon as connectivity returned, amplifying the very outages I wanted to prevent. I fixed that by tuning retry intervals and adding jitter to backoff algorithms, which spread out the reconnect attempts. This simple change eliminated unnecessary load and smoothed recovery.</p>    <p>Monitoring and alerting also needed serious adjustment. Some alerts never fired, while others flooded me with irrelevant warnings. I rewrote several rules to trigger only after sustained failures and organized them by probable root cause. This helped surface the first real indicator, rather than the last symptom, and reduced the noise during recovery.</p>    <h2>
Counterpoints and safer alternative approaches

Why real networks and vendors disagree with me

<p>There are valid reasons most administrators avoid running chaotic experiments. Simulating failures in a live network carries a real risk of data loss and user disruption. Vendors often recommend formal chaos engineering frameworks with strict controls, rollback mechanisms, and monitoring safeguards. These systems ensure that each test is deliberate and reversible, which my first attempts were not.</p>    <p>Some professionals argue that lab results cannot fully replicate production behavior. Real networks include unpredictable traffic, hardware quirks, and concurrent workloads that are hard to model. A failure scenario in a lab might look clean but behave entirely differently when thousands of users are involved. I now see the merit in starting with lab simulations, but treating them as training, rather than validation.</p>    <p>For individuals running home labs, the boundary between safe testing and reckless experimentation is thin. The key is containment. Keep destructive testing inside virtualized networks or hosts you fully control. Never direct fault injections toward upstream providers or any shared infrastructure, and document every step so recovery remains possible even if things go sideways.</p>    <h2>
When to use this approach and when to stop
</h2><h3>
Situations where outage simulation helps versus harms
</h3>

<p>Simulating outages is valuable when the goal is to strengthen internal processes. It helps you verify alert accuracy, backup readiness, and recovery automation without depending on a real disaster. For solo home lab users, these controlled experiments can highlight weaknesses early and improve overall system stability. They also provide a sense of confidence that is difficult to gain from passive observation.</p>    <p>There are times, however, when it becomes counterproductive. If your tests begin disrupting unrelated devices, you have crossed a line. I once broke remote backups that relied on my network simply because I forgot they shared the same gateway. Limiting scope and defining clear boundaries prevent those incidents and keep experimentation ethical.</p>    <p>It is also important to consider the needs of other users. If family members or coworkers share your connection, surprise network tests are not fair to them. Schedule downtime windows or perform tests on isolated hardware when possible. Respect for others ensures your learning process does not come at someone else’s expense.</p>    <h2>
Practical checklist and key tools for safe testing

Steps to plan, run, and recover from outages

<ol>
<li>
Define your scope before touching anything. Identify which systems will be affected and confirm that they are under your control.
</li>
<li>
Automate both setup and teardown. Scripts prevent human error and make each run consistent.
</li>
<li>
Start with mocks and virtual networks instead of production services.
</li>
<li>
Configure retries and backoff strategies before testing to avoid storm effects.
</li>
<li>
Document every test, note what broke, and record the fixes for future reference.
</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps turned my chaotic experiments into repeatable drills. Having a structured plan gave me confidence that I could recover quickly. It also helped me compare results between runs and measure improvement over time.</p>    <h3>
Commands and utilities I found most useful
</h3>
<p>The command <strong>tc</strong> remains the best tool for simulating latency and packet loss. An abbreviation for “traffic control,” <strong>tc</strong> lets you control delay, jitter, and drop rates with precise timing. Network namespaces isolate failures safely, while <strong>iptables</strong> or <strong>nftables</strong> handle selective blocking of ports or destinations. I used <strong>dnsmasq</strong> for DNS failures and small HTTP containers for mock services. Together, these components covered nearly every failure mode I wanted to study.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>These tools aren't the only ones available for such simulations, and I won't even argue they're the best ones. They are, however, robust and suit this sort of purpose quite well. Whatever tools you use, the biggest takeaway from this experiment is that comprehensive documentation is your best friend for network disaster recovery. </p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>I also tracked key metrics during tests to measure effectiveness. Alert response times, recovery durations, retry counts, and false positive rates revealed where my automation needed improvement. Monitoring these metrics transformed each test from a random experiment into a measurable improvement exercise. Over time, I saw evident progress in both detection speed and recovery reliability.</p>    <h2>
What I ultimately learned from breaking my network
</h2><p>Simulating outages in my lab gave me a realistic view of how fragile my systems could be. The process exposed hidden dependencies, unreliable retry logic, and weaknesses in my alerting setup. Each controlled failure led to an improvement in how I build and maintain services. While I would not recommend reckless testing, a thoughtful approach can make your network far more resilient than it was before.</p>]]></content:encoded>
