      <![CDATA[<p>If you were dumped in a world where people spoke an entirely different language and held unique customs from those on Earth, how confident are you that you'd be able to decipher what everyone is saying via context clues? If that sounds like something you'd love the opportunity to do, then Chants of Sennaar is the game for you. I picked it up in a sale a while ago, and I had a blast completing all of the content and getting the best ending. Now I'm gently sliding it across the table to you, as the game is now 40% off on Steam and, in my opinion, well worth it.</p>    <h2>
Chants of Sennaar is just $12 on Steam right now
</h2>
<p>Chants of Sennaar starts with you waking up in a foreign world. Nobody speaks your language, and every time they say something, their words appear as glyphs in a speech bubble. It's up to you to decipher what those glyphs mean by the context of what the person is doing or gesturing toward. Once you have a solid guess as to what they mean, you can type in what you think the word means, and the game will automatically add it into the NPC's speech so you can give your logic a test-drive.</p>    <p>Fortunately, the game does have a Curse of the Obra-Dinn-esque 'lock-in' mechanic to prevent you from going too far astray. Your character has a book, and within that book are drawings of actions and concepts beside a selection of the glyphs that the people speak. If you think you know what goes where, you can match the glyph to the illustration; get a page spread 100% complete, and the game will lock it in, so you can be sure those words are correct. The ultimate goal is to learn every word of the people around you, but who says that's the <em>only</em> civilization with its own language in the tower?</p>    <p>Here's how the devs describe it:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>Inspired by the myth of Babel, discover an enigmatic and vast tower. As the Traveler, delve into a world full of mysteries, where Peoples have grown distant, unable to communicate with each other anymore. Begin your adventure in a prodigious tower inhabited by five distinct Peoples, observe, listen, and strive to mend the bonds of distrust.</p>
<p>With a smart gameplay system, explore and solve various puzzles to uncover the mysteries of five different interconnected languages. Always guided by your trusty notebook, note each symbol, keep track of your surroundings, engage in conversations with people and unravel the meaning of every glyph. Each step will pave your way to the top of the Tower as each word will restore the link between People.</p>
</blockquote><p>If you're interested in giving it a try, it's currently available for $12 on Steam at a 40% discount until October 25th. Given that it has 98% positive reviews, it's clear that other people love it just as much as I do. Just hit the "where to play" button below and select Steam to head to the store page.

      <![CDATA[<p>If you were dumped in a world where people spoke an entirely different language and held unique customs from those on Earth, how confident are you that you'd be able to decipher what everyone is saying via context clues? If that sounds like something you'd love the opportunity to do, then Chants of Sennaar is the game for you. I picked it up in a sale a while ago, and I had a blast completing all of the content and getting the best ending. Now I'm gently sliding it across the table to you, as the game is now 40% off on Steam and, in my opinion, well worth it.</p>    <h2>
Chants of Sennaar is just $12 on Steam right now
</h2>
<p>Chants of Sennaar starts with you waking up in a foreign world. Nobody speaks your language, and every time they say something, their words appear as glyphs in a speech bubble. It's up to you to decipher what those glyphs mean by the context of what the person is doing or gesturing toward. Once you have a solid guess as to what they mean, you can type in what you think the word means, and the game will automatically add it into the NPC's speech so you can give your logic a test-drive.</p>    <p>Fortunately, the game does have a Curse of the Obra-Dinn-esque 'lock-in' mechanic to prevent you from going too far astray. Your character has a book, and within that book are drawings of actions and concepts beside a selection of the glyphs that the people speak. If you think you know what goes where, you can match the glyph to the illustration; get a page spread 100% complete, and the game will lock it in, so you can be sure those words are correct. The ultimate goal is to learn every word of the people around you, but who says that's the <em>only</em> civilization with its own language in the tower?</p>    <p>Here's how the devs describe it:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>Inspired by the myth of Babel, discover an enigmatic and vast tower. As the Traveler, delve into a world full of mysteries, where Peoples have grown distant, unable to communicate with each other anymore. Begin your adventure in a prodigious tower inhabited by five distinct Peoples, observe, listen, and strive to mend the bonds of distrust.</p>
<p>With a smart gameplay system, explore and solve various puzzles to uncover the mysteries of five different interconnected languages. Always guided by your trusty notebook, note each symbol, keep track of your surroundings, engage in conversations with people and unravel the meaning of every glyph. Each step will pave your way to the top of the Tower as each word will restore the link between People.</p>
</blockquote><p>If you're interested in giving it a try, it's currently available for $12 on Steam at a 40% discount until October 25th. Given that it has 98% positive reviews, it's clear that other people love it just as much as I do. Just hit the "where to play" button below and select Steam to head to the store page.

Once you have a solid guess as to what they mean, you can type in what you think the word means, and the game will automatically add it into the NPC's speech so you can give your logic a test-drive.</p>    <p>Fortunately, the game does have a Curse of the Obra-Dinn-esque 'lock-in' mechanic to prevent you from going too far astray. Your character has a book, and within that book are drawings of actions and concepts beside a selection of the glyphs that the people speak. If you think you know what goes where, you can match the glyph to the illustration; get a page spread 100% complete, and the game will lock it in, so you can be sure those words are correct. The ultimate goal is to learn every word of the people around you, but who says that's the <em>only</em> civilization with its own language in the tower?</p>    <p>Here's how the devs describe it:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>Inspired by the myth of Babel, discover an enigmatic and vast tower. As the Traveler, delve into a world full of mysteries, where Peoples have grown distant, unable to communicate with each other anymore. Begin your adventure in a prodigious tower inhabited by five distinct Peoples, observe, listen, and strive to mend the bonds of distrust.</p>
<p>With a smart gameplay system, explore and solve various puzzles to uncover the mysteries of five different interconnected languages. Always guided by your trusty notebook, note each symbol, keep track of your surroundings, engage in conversations with people and unravel the meaning of every glyph. Each step will pave your way to the top of the Tower as each word will restore the link between People.</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/recovery-contacts-verify-google-account/" target="_blank">The Keyword</a>, Google breaks down what its new Recovery Contacts are. It's essentially another layer of recovery you can add to your account, which allows you to get your stuff back even when the worst happens. The example Google gives is if you have 2FA attached to your account, but you end up losing access to the device from which you get the codes.</p>    <p>Usually, you'd need to prod Google's support team to get your account back. However, with Recovery Contacts, you can now add up to ten trusted individuals.

It's a great way to get in if everything goes pear-shaped, and the contact doesn't see any personal information about your account.</p>    <p>You can add people to your Recovery Contacts via <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/recoverycontacts?utm_source=rc&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=cam2025" target="_blank">g.co/recovery-contacts</a>. During the process, you can click a link that provides more information about who you should select as your contacts. The internet giant recommends that they fit the following criteria:</p>    <blockquote>

You know well and trust, like a family member or a close friend.
</li>
<li>
Can respond within 15 minutes if you need help with your account.

However, some tools are designed to help pretty much everyone, and one such example is the Command Palette. And the good news is that Microsoft has finally fixed one of its biggest issues in the latest PowerToys update.</p>    <p>Microsoft has released PowerToys version 0.95, adding several new features and improvements to help users take Windows Customization to another level. One of the major highlights in this update is an improved Command Palette, but the update also has so many other new features that you'll find handy.</p>    <h2>
What's new in PowerToys version 0.95
</h2><p>In its official blog post, Microsoft said that the Command Palette in PowerToys 0.95 can now "find things faster than ever," thanks to smarter fallbacks. Not only is the search faster, but it's also more relevant because of the fallback improvements.</p>

<p> Slow performance was one of the major <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/command-palette-vs-powertoys-run/" target="_blank">issues with the Command Palette</a>. So, naturally, many users, including our Lead Windows Editor João Carrasqueira, wanted Microsoft to fix it. The software giant reduced the loading time of the Command Palette in version 0.93, and now it's taken care of its search performance.</p>    <p>The latest PowerToys update also adds a new utility called Light switch. This isn't a surprise because Microsoft confirmed this in the last PowerToys release. As for what the Light switch does, it lets you switch your PC between light and dark mode. You can manually set the start and end times, or leave it to PowerToys to do it based on the sunrise and sunset times in your region.</p>    <p>Another new feature worth highlighting in this release is a new default for Peek. Instead of a custom shortcut, you'll now need to press the <strong>Space</strong> bar on your keyboard to open Peek. You can also use a shortcut just like before, but for that, you need to change the default setting.</p>    <p>There is more to the new PowerToys release. You can make the Find My Mouse highlight fully transparent by adjusting the transparency slider for the cursor color in the Appearance section. The update also lets you ignore specific shortcut conflicts from the conflict dialog.</p>    <p>PowerToys 0.95 also lets you quickly remove shortcuts from utilities that you don't use. You'll be able to unassign shortcuts in the configuration dialogue using the <strong>Clear</strong> button. Additionally, it also includes some minor changes, and you can read all of them in the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/powertoys-0-95-is-here-new-light-switch-utility-faster-command-palette-and-peek-with-spacebar/" target="_blank">official release note</a>.</p>    <h2>
What's coming next?
</h2><p>Microsoft has also teased users about what new feature to expect in the next release, which will be PowerToys version 0.96. Some of the features the company is set to add next include a revamped Keyboard Manager UI, custom endpoint and local model support for Advanced Paste, Command Palette improvements, and a brand-new Shortcut Guide experience.</p>    <p>Although not explicitly mentioned, PowerToys version 0.96 will likely arrive next month.

    <itunes:summary>
      <![CDATA[<p>We have all been there: a massive research file lands on our desk, and we spend the next few hours drowning in text just to find key takeaways. That overwhelming feeling is why I overhauled my entire research process. And the secret weapon for that is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/finally-started-using-notebooklm-and-should-have-sooner/" target="_blank">NotebookLM’s Audio Overview feature</a>.</p>    <p>Instead of forcing my eyes across endless pages, I now use this simple, underutilized trick to instantly generate a spoken summary of any document. This isn’t just about speed; it’s about efficiency that allows me to absorb the core arguments and facts in a fraction of the time.</p>    <h2>
The research bottleneck
</h2><h3>
The pain point
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="upload sources in NotebookLM" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/fast-research-process-with-notebooklm-1.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> I used to think being a good researcher meant having the stamina to read everything. But honestly, it was a slow killer. The biggest hurdle in my whole workday wasn’t finding the information; it was the mind-numbing task of actually getting through it.</p>    <p>Think about files like the ‘Tesla’s Sustainable Energy Impact: 2024 Report.’ That’s 42 pages. Not huge, but still a massive time commitment. My old system was painful: sit down, grab the highlighter, and try to manually pull out the five or six most important numbers and ideas.</p>    <p>An hour would fly by, and I would still be stuck somewhere around page 12. It was just the slow, painful duty I had to get through. Sometimes, I was constantly forced to skim, which meant I probably missed key details.</p>    <p>I badly needed a simple way to jump past this exhausting roadblock and get straight to the facts.</p>    <h2>
The NotebookLM Audio Overview
</h2><h3>
It’s more capable than I initially estimated
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="research in NotebookLM" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/fast-research-process-with-notebooklm-2.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> I finally realized that the answer wasn’t to read faster; it was to listen smarter. While <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/open-source-pdf-editors-i-prefer-over-adobe-acrobat/" target="_blank">many PDF editors</a> offer such features, none of them come close to NotebookLM.</p>    <p>I simply create a new notebook, upload a dense file, and with one click, NotebookLM transforms into a full-fledged, podcast-style clip in just a few minutes.</p>    <p>In my experiment with the Tesla file, NotebookLM created a 17-minute clip that I can listen to on the go. Now, instead of wading through dense paragraphs, I can hit play and hear two AI hosts engaging in a lively, conversational deep dive.</p>    <p>While listening, I don’t even need to leave the screen; I use NotebookLM’s built-in notes feature right alongside the player to quickly jot down key points, like gigawatt-hour figures or specific CO2 reduction goals.</p>    <p>I essentially fly through the entire document’s essence in the time it takes to brew a cup of tea.</p>    <p>Plus, as someone who values accessibility and works with multilingual teams, the option to generate these audio overviews in regional Indian languages is a huge bonus.</p>    <p>It means I can process complex, technical information in a language that feels most natural, instantly breaking down a major research barrier. This simple audio shift cut my required reading time by 90% and turned a daunting report into a quick, insightful listen.</p>    <h2>
The benefits are obvious
</h2><h3>
NotebookLM offers many perks
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1406948578" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1406948578" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1406948578" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1406948578" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1406948578-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>

<p>By using the Audio Overview, I bypass two hours of painful reading and replace it with a 15-minute listen. When I finish listening to that ‘Tesla Report’ summary, I haven’t just absorbed the highlights; I’m armed with context.</p>    <p>Once the overview is done, my research doesn’t stop. I use the chat feature to ask targeted, complex questions about the source material.</p>    <p>For example, I might ask, ‘How does the project battery output for 2026 compare specifically to the 2024 figures?’ or ‘How did the 2024 solar deployment numbers differ in North America versus Europe?’ and NotebookLM instantly cross-references the entire report to give me a precise answer and acts as a personal, instant research assistant.</p>    <p>This is just one example. The possibilities are endless here. At any point, you can open the notebook, start asking questions, and get answers in no time.</p>    <p>Ultimately, all these features mean I move past the ‘consumption’ phase almost instantly. I’m no longer spending 90% of my time reading and 10% analyzing.</p>    <p>I can spend my day developing arguments and writing compelling content, all grounded in verified information I processed in minutes.</p>    <p>NotebookLM has also recently introduced the video overview feature. While I haven’t tried it yet, I can’t wait to test it out for my future projects.</p>    <h2>
Research workflow upgrade
</h2><p>This NotebookLM trick isn’t just a minor improvement; it’s a fundamental shift in how we approach research. By leveraging the Audio Overview, you move from being a slow, linear reader to a quick, high-level processor.</p>    <p>A huge reduction in reading time means hours back in my week, allowing me to spend more time on analysis, writing, and actual thinking, rather than just consumption.</p>    <p>So what are you waiting for? If you have a research file sitting open right now, why not give this trick a shot?

<p>It's important to be able to upgrade your PC when the time comes, and a lot of affordable mini PCs don't really offer that route. So when we found this Geekom mini PC that can be upgraded, we knew we had to recommend it. While it's normally priced at $749, but you can now grab it for $250 off, dropping the price to just $499.</p>    <p>It's not the cheapest mini PC that we've seen on Amazon, but this one packs tons of power thanks to its impressive mix of parts, like an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage. Get it now at this price while you still can. We don't think you'll find it for lower.</p>    <h2>
Power in a compact size

<p>This is one of those mini PCs that's going to be able to handle anything you throw at it right out of the box. As mentioned before, you're getting loads of power here with an AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS chip, along with 32GB of DDR5 RAM and 1TB of SSD storage.</p>    <p>The great news is that if this isn't enough, you can always expand the RAM and storage, maxing out at 96GB and 4TB respectively. It's a pretty good setup, but it's even better that you can upgrade it later. In addition, it also packs AMD Radeon 780M graphics.</p>    <p>It's not going to be the most powerful graphics chip on the market right now, but it's enough to play AAA games with the right settings and adjustments. The cool part is the mini PC can output to multiple monitors without any additional hardware.</p>    <p>It features two HDMI ports, and two USB-C ports. One of the USB-C ports can output video, which means you can output to three monitors at once. There's also two Ethernet ports, six USB-A, and a 3.5mm audio jack, along with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3.</p>    <p>So whether you're looking for a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/replaced-desktop-with-a-mini-pc/" target="_blank">desktop replacement</a>, media center PC, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-i-replaced-my-smart-home-hub-with-an-old-windows-mini-pc/" target="_blank">smart home hub</a>, gaming system — this mini PC can do it all. And it's not all that expensive either, which is why it's such a great option if you're on a budget.</p>]]>

<p>This is one of those mini PCs that's going to be able to handle anything you throw at it right out of the box. As mentioned before, you're getting loads of power here with an AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS chip, along with 32GB of DDR5 RAM and 1TB of SSD storage.</p>    <p>The great news is that if this isn't enough, you can always expand the RAM and storage, maxing out at 96GB and 4TB respectively. It's a pretty good setup, but it's even better that you can upgrade it later. In addition, it also packs AMD Radeon 780M graphics.</p>    <p>It's not going to be the most powerful graphics chip on the market right now, but it's enough to play AAA games with the right settings and adjustments. The cool part is the mini PC can output to multiple monitors without any additional hardware.</p>    <p>It features two HDMI ports, and two USB-C ports. One of the USB-C ports can output video, which means you can output to three monitors at once. There's also two Ethernet ports, six USB-A, and a 3.5mm audio jack, along with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3.</p>    <p>So whether you're looking for a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/replaced-desktop-with-a-mini-pc/" target="_blank">desktop replacement</a>, media center PC, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-i-replaced-my-smart-home-hub-with-an-old-windows-mini-pc/" target="_blank">smart home hub</a>, gaming system — this mini PC can do it all.

      <![CDATA[<p>Your motherboard is the most important piece of hardware in your computer for a lot of reasons. Not only do the quality of the parts used to build it matter significantly, but the UEFI or BIOS handles the initlization of all of your PC's components, and if this is built improperly, it can cause instability and other problems. However, because your motherboard is so vital as a part of the early-boot process, the steps taken by the manufacturer to harden security are incredibly important. Yet some don't appear to care.</p>    <p>Motherboard vulnerabilities are a major issue, and you would think that such an important and low-level piece of hardware would be treated with the utmost importance and care. These are some of the worst problems that have stuck around, and motherboard manufacturers don't seem to care too much about fixing them.</p>    <h2>
MSI's (In)Secure Boot
</h2><h3>
Defeats the point of Secure Boot
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1811227315" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1811227315" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1811227315" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1811227315" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1811227315-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>This is the one that I have the most personal experience with, and one that I was surprised to see was a <em>deliberate</em> choice from MSI. When I built my PC with my AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and an MSI motherboard, I launched the FaceIt anti-cheat to play <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, only to be faced with a screen that told me Secure Boot wasn't working properly. Beneath it, though, was a <a href="https://support.faceit.com/hc/en-us/articles/17258827497116-Secure-Boot-is-not-working-properly" target="_blank">hyperlink for instructions</a> on what to do if I have an MSI motherboard. On that same page was a link to a post from security researcher <a href="https://dawidpotocki.com/en/2023/01/13/msi-insecure-boot/" target="_blank">Dawid Potocki</a>, where he detailed how MSI's Secure Boot implementation isn't actually "secure."</p>    <p>The problem is that MSI's Secure Boot implementation defaults to "Always Execute," which means that unauthorized code that would normally be declined execution capabilities will run as a part of the boot process on an MSI motherboard by default. Given that the entire purpose of Secure Boot is to verify that only trusted code is involved in the boot sequence (including drivers), this default setting misses the entire point. To make matters worse, MSI has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MSI_Gaming/comments/10g9v3m/msi_statement_on_secure_boot/" target="_blank">essentially said</a> that the change was intentional, and many motherboards from MSI today are still being released with this behavior as standard.</p>    <p>Here's the statement from MSI:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>We preemptively set Secure Boot as Enabled and "Always Execute" as the default setting to offer a user-friendly environment that allows multiple end-users flexibility to build their PC systems with thousands (or more) of components that included their built-in option ROM, including OS images, resulting in higher compatibility configurations. For users who are highly concerned about security, they can still set “Image Execution Policy” as "Deny Execute" or other options manually to meet their security needs.</p>
</blockquote><p>Thankfully, users can fix this by changing their BIOS settings, but this decision to enable "Always Execute" is unique to MSI and shouldn't be a default experience out of the box. It <a href="https://dawidpotocki.com/en/2023/02/26/msi-insecure-boot-part-2/" target="_blank">goes against Microsoft's own Secure Boot guidance</a>, and affects motherboards released years later, including my     <span><a href="/msi-mpg-x870e-carbon-wifi-review/" target="_blank">MSI MPG X870E Carbon Wi-Fi</a></span>.    </p>    <h2>
PKFail and untrusted platform keys
</h2><h3>
Companies even shipped keys that said "DO NOT TRUST"
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Scanning a firmware file with PKFail" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/scan-fail-pkfail.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>If MSI’s "always execute"     <span><a href="/how-enable-secure-boot-windows-11/" target="_blank">Secure Boot</a></span> flaw wasn't concerning enough, it's far from an isolated issue. A vulnerability dubbed <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pkfail-hundreds-computers-laptops-risk/" target="_blank">PKFail</a> has shown that even when Secure Boot appears to be properly configured, the very foundation of the UEFI trust model can still collapse. First discovered by Binarly researchers, PKFail revealed that several manufacturers shipped firmware containing untrusted or test Platform Keys (PK), which are the cryptographic signatures used by Secure Boot to verify the boot process hasn't been tampered with.    </p>    <p>In short, these devices trust keys that should never have been there in the first place, as shown by the key issuer being "DO NOT TRUST" in some instances. Once a system is shipped with an insecure key baked into firmware, an attacker can use that key to sign their own malicious bootloader, which the system will then happily accept as legitimate. This isn't some theoretical edge case, either, as it stems from the way firmware is developed, with companies using shared codebases, third-party integrators, or reference UEFI implementations.</p>    <p>During testing, temporary keys are often used to sign builds for convenience, and those test certificates are meant to be replaced before a product ships. But, as PKFail shows, many weren’t. These "forgotten" keys effectively allow unsigned or malicious code to execute at the earliest stages of system boot, long before the operating system's security mechanisms can intervene. The fix was replacing the key in a BIOS update, which many motherboard manufacturers did for motherboards that were still supported... but the fact that those motherboards even shipped in the first place shows the lack of care that companies put into motherboard security in the first place.</p>    <h2>
UEFI and Secure Boot exploits keep happening
</h2><h3>
BlackLotus is one of many
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="JGINYUE B650i Night Devil UEFI" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/07/jginyue-b650i-night-devil-uefi.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>UEFI vulnerabilities have a nasty habit of coming back to bite consumers as they live at the absolute bottom of the software stack, and it feels like every few months some major exploit is revealed that threatens the security of motherboards from practically every manufacturer. When a flaw exists in a signed, privileged component (like the boot manager, a signed driver, or an SMM handler), attackers who can reach the system through admin access on the host operating system or with physical access can weaponize that flaw to take control before the OS ever loads. That means normal endpoint protections like antivirus, kernel integrity checks, or BitLocker can be rendered useless if the attacker has made their code persistent through the motherboard firmware itself.

<p>This is the one that I have the most personal experience with, and one that I was surprised to see was a <em>deliberate</em> choice from MSI. When I built my PC with my AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and an MSI motherboard, I launched the FaceIt anti-cheat to play <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, only to be faced with a screen that told me Secure Boot wasn't working properly. Beneath it, though, was a <a href="https://support.faceit.com/hc/en-us/articles/17258827497116-Secure-Boot-is-not-working-properly" target="_blank">hyperlink for instructions</a> on what to do if I have an MSI motherboard. On that same page was a link to a post from security researcher <a href="https://dawidpotocki.com/en/2023/01/13/msi-insecure-boot/" target="_blank">Dawid Potocki</a>, where he detailed how MSI's Secure Boot implementation isn't actually "secure."</p>    <p>The problem is that MSI's Secure Boot implementation defaults to "Always Execute," which means that unauthorized code that would normally be declined execution capabilities will run as a part of the boot process on an MSI motherboard by default. Given that the entire purpose of Secure Boot is to verify that only trusted code is involved in the boot sequence (including drivers), this default setting misses the entire point. To make matters worse, MSI has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MSI_Gaming/comments/10g9v3m/msi_statement_on_secure_boot/" target="_blank">essentially said</a> that the change was intentional, and many motherboards from MSI today are still being released with this behavior as standard.</p>    <p>Here's the statement from MSI:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>We preemptively set Secure Boot as Enabled and "Always Execute" as the default setting to offer a user-friendly environment that allows multiple end-users flexibility to build their PC systems with thousands (or more) of components that included their built-in option ROM, including OS images, resulting in higher compatibility configurations. For users who are highly concerned about security, they can still set “Image Execution Policy” as "Deny Execute" or other options manually to meet their security needs.</p>
</blockquote><p>Thankfully, users can fix this by changing their BIOS settings, but this decision to enable "Always Execute" is unique to MSI and shouldn't be a default experience out of the box. It <a href="https://dawidpotocki.com/en/2023/02/26/msi-insecure-boot-part-2/" target="_blank">goes against Microsoft's own Secure Boot guidance</a>, and affects motherboards released years later, including my     <span><a href="/msi-mpg-x870e-carbon-wifi-review/" target="_blank">MSI MPG X870E Carbon Wi-Fi</a></span>.    </p>    <h2>

<p>If MSI’s "always execute"     <span><a href="/how-enable-secure-boot-windows-11/" target="_blank">Secure Boot</a></span> flaw wasn't concerning enough, it's far from an isolated issue. A vulnerability dubbed <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pkfail-hundreds-computers-laptops-risk/" target="_blank">PKFail</a> has shown that even when Secure Boot appears to be properly configured, the very foundation of the UEFI trust model can still collapse. First discovered by Binarly researchers, PKFail revealed that several manufacturers shipped firmware containing untrusted or test Platform Keys (PK), which are the cryptographic signatures used by Secure Boot to verify the boot process hasn't been tampered with.    </p>    <p>In short, these devices trust keys that should never have been there in the first place, as shown by the key issuer being "DO NOT TRUST" in some instances. Once a system is shipped with an insecure key baked into firmware, an attacker can use that key to sign their own malicious bootloader, which the system will then happily accept as legitimate. This isn't some theoretical edge case, either, as it stems from the way firmware is developed, with companies using shared codebases, third-party integrators, or reference UEFI implementations.</p>    <p>During testing, temporary keys are often used to sign builds for convenience, and those test certificates are meant to be replaced before a product ships. But, as PKFail shows, many weren’t. These "forgotten" keys effectively allow unsigned or malicious code to execute at the earliest stages of system boot, long before the operating system's security mechanisms can intervene. The fix was replacing the key in a BIOS update, which many motherboard manufacturers did for motherboards that were still supported... but the fact that those motherboards even shipped in the first place shows the lack of care that companies put into motherboard security in the first place.</p>    <h2>

<p>UEFI vulnerabilities have a nasty habit of coming back to bite consumers as they live at the absolute bottom of the software stack, and it feels like every few months some major exploit is revealed that threatens the security of motherboards from practically every manufacturer. When a flaw exists in a signed, privileged component (like the boot manager, a signed driver, or an SMM handler), attackers who can reach the system through admin access on the host operating system or with physical access can weaponize that flaw to take control before the OS ever loads. That means normal endpoint protections like antivirus, kernel integrity checks, or BitLocker can be rendered useless if the attacker has made their code persistent through the motherboard firmware itself.

      <![CDATA[<p>The popularity of sports has always been associated with a variety of sports games that were developed and released on consoles over the decades. Some of the most beloved games weren't focused on being simulations of real sports, but were instead <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/play-these-3-sports-games-to-get-ready-for-the-2025-nfl-football-season" target="_blank">arcade sports titles</a> that greatly exaggerated the concepts of physical sports. Games like <em>NBA Jam</em> and <em>NFL Blitz</em> dominated arcades with how quick they were to get into and incredibly fun they were to play. But in the wake of their success back in the 90s, other kinds of arcade sports titles were made for home consoles, and even focused on different sports that didn't always involve the biggest American sports back then.</p>    <p>Unfortunately, many of the arcade sports games to come after were often forgotten and didn't garner the larger audiences of their predecessors. While most die-hard sports fans were always playing <em>Madden NFL football</em> or <em>NBA 2K</em> games that were released annually, these arcade sports games would become niche titles that still provided fun experiences to those who engaged with them. But these games shouldn't remain as forgotten media, and should be revisited by gamers who long for something different from the typical simulation-style sports game. Here are four completely forgotten arcade sports games that were interesting, and why everyone should go back and play them again.</p>    <h2>
RedCard 2003
</h2><h3>
Crazy soccer games

</div>
<p>One of the few soccer games in the early 2000s that wasn't a simulation or had a manager-style of gameplay, <em>RedCard 2003</em> is an anomaly from a very different <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-sports-games-windows-pc" target="_blank">time for sports video games</a>. It was developed in 2002 for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox by Point of View, a studio which also worked on the boxing game <em>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing</em> with Electronic Arts. The publisher was Midway Games, which was known for a number of their arcade classics years prior. While soccer, or football as it's generally known outside the United States, is a fairly simple sport to play, it can have a lot of depth with the many rules that are enforced on the field. But like previous arcade sports titles before it, <em>RedCard 2003</em> only uses the basics when it comes to the rules of soccer, with yellow and red card penalties being part of the gimmick that shifts focus to the over-the-top action.</p>    <p>While the gameplay of <em>RedCard 2003</em> looks similar to other FIFA titles that were released back then, one can quickly see how chaotic and fast-paced the game was in comparison. Running the ball down the field and shooting is always action-packed, with players hitting each other with ridiculous kicks and flagrant hits. Penalties can still be called and change the dynamics of a match, but rougher play is heavily encouraged, and can even be tweaked in the game's options for how easily penalties can be called. Unlike previous arcade titles like <em>NBA Jam</em>, which included no fouls during gameplay, the penalties that are called break up some of the action during games.</p>

<p> <em>RedCard 2003</em> does include some goofy aspects that other arcade sports games were known to have, including mascots as part of the roster of players on the field. Having a full lineup of knights playing against extraterrestrial aliens in a game of soccer is pretty funny. Its cheeky sense of humor looks ridiculous in motion, but was still fun to control and participate in. And as one of the few <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/rematch-makes-me-excited-future-sports-games" target="_blank">soccer games that has arcade style</a> gameplay, it's one that soccer fans should definitely revisit more often.</p>    <h2>
MLB Slugfest

Baseball with an extra edge

</div>
</div>
<p> Like <em>RedCard 2003</em>, Midway Games also published the <em>MLB Slugest</em> series in the early 2000s, as part of their sports titles with an arcade twist. Popular baseball games of the time included <em>MLB: The Show</em> and <em>EA Sports Triple Play</em> as simulation-style baseball, which was big on consoles like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/rarest-playstation-2-games" target="_blank">the PlayStation 2</a> and original Xbox. But <em>MLB Slugest</em> took an exaggerated approach to the game of baseball, making it look and feel more hectic than a typical baseball game. Players could catch fire with their throws and times at bat, launch baseballs out of the park on a frequent basis. It was the formula for <em>NBA Jam</em> applied to a baseball setting, and it worked out pretty well, especially for baseball fans that wanted a change of pace.</p>    <p>The controls for the <em>MLB Slugest</em> games were simple and easy to use either at bat or on the field, which follows in the footsteps of other sports games with a similar approach. One of the more interesting things about <em>MLB Slugest</em> was how some of the rules of real baseball were tinkered with to add a strategic element to games. Hitting a batter with the ball would cause them to take a base, but it would also give them a stat debuff that could affect how they run or hit at their next time at bat. Things like this could add up during each inning and open up more opportunities for big plays. There were a few <em>MLB Slugest</em> titles that would release in the early 2000s, before the series went away after the release of <em>MLB Slugest 2006</em> by developer Blue Shift. <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/i-want-a-second-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-to-have-these-games-in-it" target="_blank">Midway Games</a> a few years later would close up, and the series never returned.</p>

<p>While some people may remember <em>NBA Hangtime</em>, it is frequently <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/classic-basketball-games-perfect-play-and-get-ready-new-nba-season" target="_blank">overshadowed by the more popular game</a>, <em>NBA Jam</em>, that inspired it. <em>NBA Hangtime</em> is the equivilant of telling a child that they have <em>NBA Jam</em> at home, as it has many similarities to Midway's original arcade basketball game. This is because the original team that made <em>NBA Jam</em> also worked on <em>NBA Hangtime</em> as their third basketball title, after the license for <em>NBA Jam</em> was acquired by another company, Acclaim Entertainment. But many people, both back then and even now, consider this game to be the spiritual sequel to the series, because it looks and plays so much like the previous <em>NBA Jam</em> titles.</p>    <p>What <em>NBA Hangtime</em> does add to the mix is a new custom character creator. You can have a custom player with stat points that change their effectiveness on the court, which can also be increased by winning games with them. At the same time, the home console version of the game has random quizzes that pop up in-between games, which can yield more stat points for custom characters if answered correctly. The arcade version had these quizzes too, but offered players a chance to win real prizes within arcades. For many players, this was a welcome addition to the core formula that <em>NBA Jam</em> established prior, and most likely would've been expanded upon if the series continued after.</p>

<p> <em>NBA Hangtime</em> has many of the same gameplay aspects as <em>NBA Jam: Tournament Edition</em>, but also includes more players to select from with each NBA team. Instead of having three players to cycle through for 3-on-3 basketball, each team now has five players to choose from. Some NBA players didn't appear in <em>NBA Hangtime </em>for licensing reasons, most notably Shaquille O' Neil, which was a situation comparable to what happened with Michael Jordan in <em>NBA Jam</em> years before. Anyone that loves the style of gameplay and the fast-paced nature of <em>NBA Jam</em> will find many of the same beats to love in <em>NBA Hangtime</em>, especially if you weren't a fan of what Activision had done with <em>NBA Jam: Extreme</em> that same year.</p>

<p> The series of games from Electronic Arts in the 2000s is always remembered by the release of the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-overlooked-playstation-2-titles-that-deserve-modern-remasters" target="_blank"><em>NBA Street</em> games</a>. But the other sports titles that were part of the same umbrella were still very interesting, especially for those who got to play <em>NFL Street</em>. Like its predecessor, <em>NFL Street</em> blends street culture with NFL football, allowing for the fun and flair of the game to take center stage. While the series had sequels that were released up to 2006, the first game in the series is often the most beloved and remembered the most. The game was often cited as one of the best alternative sports titles of the year, with the only other game beating it out for awards back then was <em>Mario Power Tennis</em> for the Nintendo GameCube.</p>    <p><em>NFL Street</em> doesn't focus too much on the intricacies of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/football-manager-25-will-be-the-first-ive-wanted-since-2012" target="_blank">American-style football</a>, but rather the hard hits and flashy moves when trying to get to the end zone. Making touchdowns, celebrating in style, and going for big plays that intimidate opponents is central to the overall experience, but the theme of street culture in the visual presentation is what made the game unique among other arcade sports games. <em>NBA Street</em> was the first to establish the street theme as a successful approach, while its sequel took things even further for the glamorous style of street basketball. But <em>NFL Street</em> was able to highlight more of the gritty attitude that was part of street culture, since the sport of football was seen as tougher and harder-edged than basketball. There's a more blunt and confrontational vibe in <em>NFL Street</em>, which felt very different from <em>NBA Street</em>, even though both games were very fun to play.</p>

<p> After the release of <em>NFL Street 3</em>, the studio behind many of the street games was shut down in 2008. Priorities at Electronic Arts had shifted to put more energy into simulation sports series, such as their <em>Madden NFL Football</em> games. A lot of this was also the result of Electronic Arts securing exclusivity for the license to NFL teams and players, allowing them to have a hold on the market for football games. Even though the <em>NFL Street</em> series could have continued, everything happening at EA didn't allow for more games to be developed, since it was gearing towards further developing the <em>Madden</em> series annually.</p>

<h3>
Gone but should not be forgotten
</h3>
<p>Arcade sports games are a fun alternative to the simulation experiences that we see so often on consoles. They allow fans to really go far with some of the crazier aspects of sports and flex the creativity of developers that have a deep love and appreciation for the sports themselves. But while some arcade sports games have <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-it-felt-like-witnessing-console-wars" target="_blank">become gaming classics</a>, others were often left behind in their time, even when they were fun to play and provided something interesting for fans. These arcade sports games are worth rediscovering and playing again, even though they may never be released in the modern day. Players who were around at the time and dived into the wild experiences these forgotten sports games provided will vividly remember how exciting they were. They may be gone for various reasons, but should never be forgotten because of how much fun they were.</p>]]>

    <description>
      <![CDATA[<p>The popularity of sports has always been associated with a variety of sports games that were developed and released on consoles over the decades. Some of the most beloved games weren't focused on being simulations of real sports, but were instead <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/play-these-3-sports-games-to-get-ready-for-the-2025-nfl-football-season" target="_blank">arcade sports titles</a> that greatly exaggerated the concepts of physical sports. Games like <em>NBA Jam</em> and <em>NFL Blitz</em> dominated arcades with how quick they were to get into and incredibly fun they were to play. But in the wake of their success back in the 90s, other kinds of arcade sports titles were made for home consoles, and even focused on different sports that didn't always involve the biggest American sports back then.</p>    <p>Unfortunately, many of the arcade sports games to come after were often forgotten and didn't garner the larger audiences of their predecessors. While most die-hard sports fans were always playing <em>Madden NFL football</em> or <em>NBA 2K</em> games that were released annually, these arcade sports games would become niche titles that still provided fun experiences to those who engaged with them. But these games shouldn't remain as forgotten media, and should be revisited by gamers who long for something different from the typical simulation-style sports game. Here are four completely forgotten arcade sports games that were interesting, and why everyone should go back and play them again.</p>    <h2>
RedCard 2003
</h2><h3>
Crazy soccer games
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-376908414" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-376908414" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-376908414" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-376908414" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-376908414-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the few soccer games in the early 2000s that wasn't a simulation or had a manager-style of gameplay, <em>RedCard 2003</em> is an anomaly from a very different <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-sports-games-windows-pc" target="_blank">time for sports video games</a>. It was developed in 2002 for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox by Point of View, a studio which also worked on the boxing game <em>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing</em> with Electronic Arts. The publisher was Midway Games, which was known for a number of their arcade classics years prior. While soccer, or football as it's generally known outside the United States, is a fairly simple sport to play, it can have a lot of depth with the many rules that are enforced on the field. But like previous arcade sports titles before it, <em>RedCard 2003</em> only uses the basics when it comes to the rules of soccer, with yellow and red card penalties being part of the gimmick that shifts focus to the over-the-top action.</p>    <p>While the gameplay of <em>RedCard 2003</em> looks similar to other FIFA titles that were released back then, one can quickly see how chaotic and fast-paced the game was in comparison. Running the ball down the field and shooting is always action-packed, with players hitting each other with ridiculous kicks and flagrant hits. Penalties can still be called and change the dynamics of a match, but rougher play is heavily encouraged, and can even be tweaked in the game's options for how easily penalties can be called. Unlike previous arcade titles like <em>NBA Jam</em>, which included no fouls during gameplay, the penalties that are called break up some of the action during games.</p>

<p> <em>RedCard 2003</em> does include some goofy aspects that other arcade sports games were known to have, including mascots as part of the roster of players on the field. Having a full lineup of knights playing against extraterrestrial aliens in a game of soccer is pretty funny. Its cheeky sense of humor looks ridiculous in motion, but was still fun to control and participate in. And as one of the few <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/rematch-makes-me-excited-future-sports-games" target="_blank">soccer games that has arcade style</a> gameplay, it's one that soccer fans should definitely revisit more often.</p>    <h2>
MLB Slugfest
</h2><h3>
Baseball with an extra edge
</h3>

<p> Like <em>RedCard 2003</em>, Midway Games also published the <em>MLB Slugest</em> series in the early 2000s, as part of their sports titles with an arcade twist. Popular baseball games of the time included <em>MLB: The Show</em> and <em>EA Sports Triple Play</em> as simulation-style baseball, which was big on consoles like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/rarest-playstation-2-games" target="_blank">the PlayStation 2</a> and original Xbox. But <em>MLB Slugest</em> took an exaggerated approach to the game of baseball, making it look and feel more hectic than a typical baseball game. Players could catch fire with their throws and times at bat, launch baseballs out of the park on a frequent basis. It was the formula for <em>NBA Jam</em> applied to a baseball setting, and it worked out pretty well, especially for baseball fans that wanted a change of pace.</p>    <p>The controls for the <em>MLB Slugest</em> games were simple and easy to use either at bat or on the field, which follows in the footsteps of other sports games with a similar approach. One of the more interesting things about <em>MLB Slugest</em> was how some of the rules of real baseball were tinkered with to add a strategic element to games. Hitting a batter with the ball would cause them to take a base, but it would also give them a stat debuff that could affect how they run or hit at their next time at bat. Things like this could add up during each inning and open up more opportunities for big plays. There were a few <em>MLB Slugest</em> titles that would release in the early 2000s, before the series went away after the release of <em>MLB Slugest 2006</em> by developer Blue Shift. <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/i-want-a-second-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-to-have-these-games-in-it" target="_blank">Midway Games</a> a few years later would close up, and the series never returned.</p>

<p>While some people may remember <em>NBA Hangtime</em>, it is frequently <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/classic-basketball-games-perfect-play-and-get-ready-new-nba-season" target="_blank">overshadowed by the more popular game</a>, <em>NBA Jam</em>, that inspired it. <em>NBA Hangtime</em> is the equivilant of telling a child that they have <em>NBA Jam</em> at home, as it has many similarities to Midway's original arcade basketball game. This is because the original team that made <em>NBA Jam</em> also worked on <em>NBA Hangtime</em> as their third basketball title, after the license for <em>NBA Jam</em> was acquired by another company, Acclaim Entertainment. But many people, both back then and even now, consider this game to be the spiritual sequel to the series, because it looks and plays so much like the previous <em>NBA Jam</em> titles.</p>    <p>What <em>NBA Hangtime</em> does add to the mix is a new custom character creator. You can have a custom player with stat points that change their effectiveness on the court, which can also be increased by winning games with them. At the same time, the home console version of the game has random quizzes that pop up in-between games, which can yield more stat points for custom characters if answered correctly. The arcade version had these quizzes too, but offered players a chance to win real prizes within arcades. For many players, this was a welcome addition to the core formula that <em>NBA Jam</em> established prior, and most likely would've been expanded upon if the series continued after.</p>

<p> <em>NBA Hangtime</em> has many of the same gameplay aspects as <em>NBA Jam: Tournament Edition</em>, but also includes more players to select from with each NBA team. Instead of having three players to cycle through for 3-on-3 basketball, each team now has five players to choose from. Some NBA players didn't appear in <em>NBA Hangtime </em>for licensing reasons, most notably Shaquille O' Neil, which was a situation comparable to what happened with Michael Jordan in <em>NBA Jam</em> years before. Anyone that loves the style of gameplay and the fast-paced nature of <em>NBA Jam</em> will find many of the same beats to love in <em>NBA Hangtime</em>, especially if you weren't a fan of what Activision had done with <em>NBA Jam: Extreme</em> that same year.</p>

<p> The series of games from Electronic Arts in the 2000s is always remembered by the release of the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-overlooked-playstation-2-titles-that-deserve-modern-remasters" target="_blank"><em>NBA Street</em> games</a>. But the other sports titles that were part of the same umbrella were still very interesting, especially for those who got to play <em>NFL Street</em>. Like its predecessor, <em>NFL Street</em> blends street culture with NFL football, allowing for the fun and flair of the game to take center stage. While the series had sequels that were released up to 2006, the first game in the series is often the most beloved and remembered the most. The game was often cited as one of the best alternative sports titles of the year, with the only other game beating it out for awards back then was <em>Mario Power Tennis</em> for the Nintendo GameCube.</p>    <p><em>NFL Street</em> doesn't focus too much on the intricacies of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/football-manager-25-will-be-the-first-ive-wanted-since-2012" target="_blank">American-style football</a>, but rather the hard hits and flashy moves when trying to get to the end zone. Making touchdowns, celebrating in style, and going for big plays that intimidate opponents is central to the overall experience, but the theme of street culture in the visual presentation is what made the game unique among other arcade sports games. <em>NBA Street</em> was the first to establish the street theme as a successful approach, while its sequel took things even further for the glamorous style of street basketball. But <em>NFL Street</em> was able to highlight more of the gritty attitude that was part of street culture, since the sport of football was seen as tougher and harder-edged than basketball. There's a more blunt and confrontational vibe in <em>NFL Street</em>, which felt very different from <em>NBA Street</em>, even though both games were very fun to play.</p>

<p> After the release of <em>NFL Street 3</em>, the studio behind many of the street games was shut down in 2008. Priorities at Electronic Arts had shifted to put more energy into simulation sports series, such as their <em>Madden NFL Football</em> games. A lot of this was also the result of Electronic Arts securing exclusivity for the license to NFL teams and players, allowing them to have a hold on the market for football games. Even though the <em>NFL Street</em> series could have continued, everything happening at EA didn't allow for more games to be developed, since it was gearing towards further developing the <em>Madden</em> series annually.</p>

<h3>
Gone but should not be forgotten
</h3>
<p>Arcade sports games are a fun alternative to the simulation experiences that we see so often on consoles. They allow fans to really go far with some of the crazier aspects of sports and flex the creativity of developers that have a deep love and appreciation for the sports themselves. But while some arcade sports games have <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-it-felt-like-witnessing-console-wars" target="_blank">become gaming classics</a>, others were often left behind in their time, even when they were fun to play and provided something interesting for fans. These arcade sports games are worth rediscovering and playing again, even though they may never be released in the modern day. Players who were around at the time and dived into the wild experiences these forgotten sports games provided will vividly remember how exciting they were. They may be gone for various reasons, but should never be forgotten because of how much fun they were.</p>]]>
    </description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The popularity of sports has always been associated with a variety of sports games that were developed and released on consoles over the decades. Some of the most beloved games weren't focused on being simulations of real sports, but were instead <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/play-these-3-sports-games-to-get-ready-for-the-2025-nfl-football-season" target="_blank">arcade sports titles</a> that greatly exaggerated the concepts of physical sports. Games like <em>NBA Jam</em> and <em>NFL Blitz</em> dominated arcades with how quick they were to get into and incredibly fun they were to play. But in the wake of their success back in the 90s, other kinds of arcade sports titles were made for home consoles, and even focused on different sports that didn't always involve the biggest American sports back then.</p>    <p>Unfortunately, many of the arcade sports games to come after were often forgotten and didn't garner the larger audiences of their predecessors. While most die-hard sports fans were always playing <em>Madden NFL football</em> or <em>NBA 2K</em> games that were released annually, these arcade sports games would become niche titles that still provided fun experiences to those who engaged with them. But these games shouldn't remain as forgotten media, and should be revisited by gamers who long for something different from the typical simulation-style sports game. Here are four completely forgotten arcade sports games that were interesting, and why everyone should go back and play them again.</p>    <h2>
RedCard 2003
</h2><h3>
Crazy soccer games
</h3>

<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-376908414" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-376908414" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-376908414" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-376908414" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-376908414-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the few soccer games in the early 2000s that wasn't a simulation or had a manager-style of gameplay, <em>RedCard 2003</em> is an anomaly from a very different <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-sports-games-windows-pc" target="_blank">time for sports video games</a>. It was developed in 2002 for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox by Point of View, a studio which also worked on the boxing game <em>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing</em> with Electronic Arts. The publisher was Midway Games, which was known for a number of their arcade classics years prior. While soccer, or football as it's generally known outside the United States, is a fairly simple sport to play, it can have a lot of depth with the many rules that are enforced on the field. But like previous arcade sports titles before it, <em>RedCard 2003</em> only uses the basics when it comes to the rules of soccer, with yellow and red card penalties being part of the gimmick that shifts focus to the over-the-top action.</p>    <p>While the gameplay of <em>RedCard 2003</em> looks similar to other FIFA titles that were released back then, one can quickly see how chaotic and fast-paced the game was in comparison. Running the ball down the field and shooting is always action-packed, with players hitting each other with ridiculous kicks and flagrant hits. Penalties can still be called and change the dynamics of a match, but rougher play is heavily encouraged, and can even be tweaked in the game's options for how easily penalties can be called. Unlike previous arcade titles like <em>NBA Jam</em>, which included no fouls during gameplay, the penalties that are called break up some of the action during games.</p>

<p> <em>RedCard 2003</em> does include some goofy aspects that other arcade sports games were known to have, including mascots as part of the roster of players on the field. Having a full lineup of knights playing against extraterrestrial aliens in a game of soccer is pretty funny. Its cheeky sense of humor looks ridiculous in motion, but was still fun to control and participate in. And as one of the few <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/rematch-makes-me-excited-future-sports-games" target="_blank">soccer games that has arcade style</a> gameplay, it's one that soccer fans should definitely revisit more often.</p>    <h2>

<p> Like <em>RedCard 2003</em>, Midway Games also published the <em>MLB Slugest</em> series in the early 2000s, as part of their sports titles with an arcade twist. Popular baseball games of the time included <em>MLB: The Show</em> and <em>EA Sports Triple Play</em> as simulation-style baseball, which was big on consoles like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/rarest-playstation-2-games" target="_blank">the PlayStation 2</a> and original Xbox. But <em>MLB Slugest</em> took an exaggerated approach to the game of baseball, making it look and feel more hectic than a typical baseball game. Players could catch fire with their throws and times at bat, launch baseballs out of the park on a frequent basis. It was the formula for <em>NBA Jam</em> applied to a baseball setting, and it worked out pretty well, especially for baseball fans that wanted a change of pace.</p>    <p>The controls for the <em>MLB Slugest</em> games were simple and easy to use either at bat or on the field, which follows in the footsteps of other sports games with a similar approach. One of the more interesting things about <em>MLB Slugest</em> was how some of the rules of real baseball were tinkered with to add a strategic element to games. Hitting a batter with the ball would cause them to take a base, but it would also give them a stat debuff that could affect how they run or hit at their next time at bat. Things like this could add up during each inning and open up more opportunities for big plays. There were a few <em>MLB Slugest</em> titles that would release in the early 2000s, before the series went away after the release of <em>MLB Slugest 2006</em> by developer Blue Shift. <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/i-want-a-second-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-to-have-these-games-in-it" target="_blank">Midway Games</a> a few years later would close up, and the series never returned.</p>

<p>While some people may remember <em>NBA Hangtime</em>, it is frequently <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/classic-basketball-games-perfect-play-and-get-ready-new-nba-season" target="_blank">overshadowed by the more popular game</a>, <em>NBA Jam</em>, that inspired it. <em>NBA Hangtime</em> is the equivilant of telling a child that they have <em>NBA Jam</em> at home, as it has many similarities to Midway's original arcade basketball game. This is because the original team that made <em>NBA Jam</em> also worked on <em>NBA Hangtime</em> as their third basketball title, after the license for <em>NBA Jam</em> was acquired by another company, Acclaim Entertainment. But many people, both back then and even now, consider this game to be the spiritual sequel to the series, because it looks and plays so much like the previous <em>NBA Jam</em> titles.</p>    <p>What <em>NBA Hangtime</em> does add to the mix is a new custom character creator. You can have a custom player with stat points that change their effectiveness on the court, which can also be increased by winning games with them. At the same time, the home console version of the game has random quizzes that pop up in-between games, which can yield more stat points for custom characters if answered correctly. The arcade version had these quizzes too, but offered players a chance to win real prizes within arcades. For many players, this was a welcome addition to the core formula that <em>NBA Jam</em> established prior, and most likely would've been expanded upon if the series continued after.</p>

<p> <em>NBA Hangtime</em> has many of the same gameplay aspects as <em>NBA Jam: Tournament Edition</em>, but also includes more players to select from with each NBA team. Instead of having three players to cycle through for 3-on-3 basketball, each team now has five players to choose from. Some NBA players didn't appear in <em>NBA Hangtime </em>for licensing reasons, most notably Shaquille O' Neil, which was a situation comparable to what happened with Michael Jordan in <em>NBA Jam</em> years before. Anyone that loves the style of gameplay and the fast-paced nature of <em>NBA Jam</em> will find many of the same beats to love in <em>NBA Hangtime</em>, especially if you weren't a fan of what Activision had done with <em>NBA Jam: Extreme</em> that same year.</p>

<p> The series of games from Electronic Arts in the 2000s is always remembered by the release of the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-overlooked-playstation-2-titles-that-deserve-modern-remasters" target="_blank"><em>NBA Street</em> games</a>. But the other sports titles that were part of the same umbrella were still very interesting, especially for those who got to play <em>NFL Street</em>. Like its predecessor, <em>NFL Street</em> blends street culture with NFL football, allowing for the fun and flair of the game to take center stage. While the series had sequels that were released up to 2006, the first game in the series is often the most beloved and remembered the most. The game was often cited as one of the best alternative sports titles of the year, with the only other game beating it out for awards back then was <em>Mario Power Tennis</em> for the Nintendo GameCube.</p>    <p><em>NFL Street</em> doesn't focus too much on the intricacies of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/football-manager-25-will-be-the-first-ive-wanted-since-2012" target="_blank">American-style football</a>, but rather the hard hits and flashy moves when trying to get to the end zone. Making touchdowns, celebrating in style, and going for big plays that intimidate opponents is central to the overall experience, but the theme of street culture in the visual presentation is what made the game unique among other arcade sports games. <em>NBA Street</em> was the first to establish the street theme as a successful approach, while its sequel took things even further for the glamorous style of street basketball. But <em>NFL Street</em> was able to highlight more of the gritty attitude that was part of street culture, since the sport of football was seen as tougher and harder-edged than basketball. There's a more blunt and confrontational vibe in <em>NFL Street</em>, which felt very different from <em>NBA Street</em>, even though both games were very fun to play.</p>

<p> After the release of <em>NFL Street 3</em>, the studio behind many of the street games was shut down in 2008. Priorities at Electronic Arts had shifted to put more energy into simulation sports series, such as their <em>Madden NFL Football</em> games. A lot of this was also the result of Electronic Arts securing exclusivity for the license to NFL teams and players, allowing them to have a hold on the market for football games. Even though the <em>NFL Street</em> series could have continued, everything happening at EA didn't allow for more games to be developed, since it was gearing towards further developing the <em>Madden</em> series annually.</p>

<h3>
Gone but should not be forgotten
</h3>
<p>Arcade sports games are a fun alternative to the simulation experiences that we see so often on consoles. They allow fans to really go far with some of the crazier aspects of sports and flex the creativity of developers that have a deep love and appreciation for the sports themselves. But while some arcade sports games have <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-it-felt-like-witnessing-console-wars" target="_blank">become gaming classics</a>, others were often left behind in their time, even when they were fun to play and provided something interesting for fans. These arcade sports games are worth rediscovering and playing again, even though they may never be released in the modern day. Players who were around at the time and dived into the wild experiences these forgotten sports games provided will vividly remember how exciting they were. They may be gone for various reasons, but should never be forgotten because of how much fun they were.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <itunes:author><![CDATA[XDA[RSS+]]]></itunes:author>
    <itunes:summary>
      <![CDATA[<p>Running a home network that’s both fast and private takes more than just blocking ads. For years, I <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pi-hole-tweaks-made-difference/" target="_blank">relied on Pi-hole</a> to keep unwanted traffic out of my devices’ DNS requests. It worked well, but something about depending on external resolvers like Cloudflare or Google DNS never felt <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dont-make-the-same-mistake-did-self-hosting-pi-hole/'" target="_blank">completely under my control</a>. I wanted to bring that part of the process home as well.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>The combination feels like a natural evolution of Pi-hole rather than an optional upgrade.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>That’s <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/using-home-unbound-dns-block-trackers/" target="_blank">where Unbound came in</a>. It’s a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver that performs its own lookups from the root servers, rather than sending queries upstream to another service. Pairing it with Pi-hole meant I could finally <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/switched-from-pi-hole-to-unbound-dns/" target="_blank">handle DNS from start to finish</a> right on my network, cutting out go-betweens and improving reliability in the process. It turned my Pi-hole into something more powerful than just an ad blocker.</p>    <h2>
Why Unbound makes Pi-hole even better
</h2><h3>
Local resolution gives real privacy and autonomy
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Pi-hole with LCARS theme" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/07/pi-hole-with-lcars-theme.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>When <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank">Pi-hole sends DNS queries</a> to Cloudflare or Google DNS, those providers can still log the requests. Even if they promise to anonymize the data, that part of the process is still outside your control. With Unbound, every query begins and ends within your own home. It contacts the root servers directly, then walks the DNS hierarchy to find the authoritative answers, caching them for future use. That means no external service can monitor your DNS traffic.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>My colleague Joe switched completely from Pi-hole to Unbound, and that's certainly a viable option. However, Unbound proved significantly slower in resolving initial queries, which may not be what you're looking for. Using Pi-hole in concert with Unbound provides a solid base for blocking ads while ensuring my external DNS queries remain under my control with privacy safeguarded.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>The difference becomes clear after a few days of use. Sites load with equal or greater speed, yet there’s no dependence on outside DNS providers. If your connection flickers, cached results from Unbound keep pages and services available until the link is restored. Combined with Pi-hole’s ad filtering, the setup creates a faster and cleaner browsing experience. Everything simply feels smoother once those two tools work together.</p>    <p>There’s also a sense of satisfaction that comes from self-reliance. Running Unbound locally means you’ve taken another part of your digital life into your own hands. You’re not relying on a company’s infrastructure or data policies to manage your traffic. Instead, your home network handles everything directly, which fits perfectly with the spirit of self-hosting that makes Pi-hole so appealing in the first place.</p>    <h2>
Performance and reliability improvements that stand out
</h2><h3>
Caching and control improve every device’s experience
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-529225248" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-529225248" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-529225248" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-529225248" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-529225248-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of Unbound is its caching capabilities. When a site is resolved once, the result is stored locally. Any future requests for that domain are answered instantly without leaving the network. Over time, this results in faster page loads and reduced dependence on external bandwidth. On networks with many devices, the performance gain becomes more noticeable every day.</p>    <p>Reliability also improves in subtle ways. External DNS servers occasionally experience latency or outages, which can cause pages to load slowly or not load at all. When you use Unbound, the cache provides a local backup of previously accessed domains. Even if the connection to the outside world is temporarily lost, devices can still resolve common addresses from the stored data. That small layer of resilience keeps streaming, gaming, and smart home devices working more consistently.</p>    <p>Compared with Cloudflare or Google DNS, Unbound may not always win the first lookup in raw speed. The real benefit shows over time. Global DNS services optimize for worldwide performance, while a local resolver optimizes for your personal environment. With continuous caching and no reliance on external lookups, Unbound provides steadier and more predictable results for a home network.</p>    <h2>
How local DNS resolution changes network behavior
</h2><h3>
Independence makes troubleshooting and privacy easier
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="perfect local DNS server" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/07/perfect-local-dns-server-featured.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Managing DNS locally changes how you view and control your network. Every request passes through your Pi-hole, which makes monitoring and debugging simple. If a device starts calling strange domains, you can see it immediately in the logs. Local overrides become easy to create, allowing you to assign custom hostnames or reroute services for testing without exposing them publicly. It’s a transparent and flexible way to run your network.</p>    <p>Privacy gains extend far beyond ad blocking. When Unbound handles DNS internally, you’re no longer feeding query data to companies that analyze it for patterns or metrics. It’s not about paranoia, but about reducing unnecessary data exposure. Every lookup stays on your own hardware, secured and cached under your supervision. It’s a small but meaningful improvement for anyone who values digital independence.</p>    <p>This kind of control also builds resilience into the network as a whole. You no longer depend on external infrastructure to function correctly. Pi-hole filters unwanted content, Unbound resolves domains, and both systems communicate locally to maintain speed and consistency. That modular approach makes your setup easier to maintain and less prone to failure from outside disruptions.</p>    <h3>
Why this setup stays in my lab permanently
</h3>

</div>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>With continuous caching and no reliance on external lookups, Unbound provides steadier and more predictable results for a home network.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>After switching to Pi-hole with Unbound, I no longer worry about who’s handling my DNS traffic or when a third-party service might have an outage. Every lookup runs from my own hardware, with logs and caching fully visible to me. The combination feels like a natural evolution of Pi-hole rather than an optional upgrade. For anyone running a home network and already invested in privacy and stability, it’s the missing piece that completes the puzzle.</p>

It’s a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver that performs its own lookups from the root servers, rather than sending queries upstream to another service. Pairing it with Pi-hole meant I could finally <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/switched-from-pi-hole-to-unbound-dns/" target="_blank">handle DNS from start to finish</a> right on my network, cutting out go-betweens and improving reliability in the process. It turned my Pi-hole into something more powerful than just an ad blocker.</p>    <h2>
Why Unbound makes Pi-hole even better

Local resolution gives real privacy and autonomy

<p>When <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank">Pi-hole sends DNS queries</a> to Cloudflare or Google DNS, those providers can still log the requests. Even if they promise to anonymize the data, that part of the process is still outside your control. With Unbound, every query begins and ends within your own home. It contacts the root servers directly, then walks the DNS hierarchy to find the authoritative answers, caching them for future use. That means no external service can monitor your DNS traffic.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>My colleague Joe switched completely from Pi-hole to Unbound, and that's certainly a viable option. However, Unbound proved significantly slower in resolving initial queries, which may not be what you're looking for. Using Pi-hole in concert with Unbound provides a solid base for blocking ads while ensuring my external DNS queries remain under my control with privacy safeguarded.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>The difference becomes clear after a few days of use. Sites load with equal or greater speed, yet there’s no dependence on outside DNS providers. If your connection flickers, cached results from Unbound keep pages and services available until the link is restored. Combined with Pi-hole’s ad filtering, the setup creates a faster and cleaner browsing experience. Everything simply feels smoother once those two tools work together.</p>    <p>There’s also a sense of satisfaction that comes from self-reliance. Running Unbound locally means you’ve taken another part of your digital life into your own hands. You’re not relying on a company’s infrastructure or data policies to manage your traffic. Instead, your home network handles everything directly, which fits perfectly with the spirit of self-hosting that makes Pi-hole so appealing in the first place.</p>    <h2>
Performance and reliability improvements that stand out
</h2><h3>
Caching and control improve every device’s experience

</div>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of Unbound is its caching capabilities. When a site is resolved once, the result is stored locally. Any future requests for that domain are answered instantly without leaving the network. Over time, this results in faster page loads and reduced dependence on external bandwidth. On networks with many devices, the performance gain becomes more noticeable every day.</p>    <p>Reliability also improves in subtle ways. External DNS servers occasionally experience latency or outages, which can cause pages to load slowly or not load at all. When you use Unbound, the cache provides a local backup of previously accessed domains. Even if the connection to the outside world is temporarily lost, devices can still resolve common addresses from the stored data. That small layer of resilience keeps streaming, gaming, and smart home devices working more consistently.</p>    <p>Compared with Cloudflare or Google DNS, Unbound may not always win the first lookup in raw speed. The real benefit shows over time. Global DNS services optimize for worldwide performance, while a local resolver optimizes for your personal environment. With continuous caching and no reliance on external lookups, Unbound provides steadier and more predictable results for a home network.</p>    <h2>
How local DNS resolution changes network behavior

</div>
<p>Managing DNS locally changes how you view and control your network. Every request passes through your Pi-hole, which makes monitoring and debugging simple. If a device starts calling strange domains, you can see it immediately in the logs. Local overrides become easy to create, allowing you to assign custom hostnames or reroute services for testing without exposing them publicly. It’s a transparent and flexible way to run your network.</p>    <p>Privacy gains extend far beyond ad blocking. When Unbound handles DNS internally, you’re no longer feeding query data to companies that analyze it for patterns or metrics. It’s not about paranoia, but about reducing unnecessary data exposure. Every lookup stays on your own hardware, secured and cached under your supervision. It’s a small but meaningful improvement for anyone who values digital independence.</p>    <p>This kind of control also builds resilience into the network as a whole. You no longer depend on external infrastructure to function correctly. Pi-hole filters unwanted content, Unbound resolves domains, and both systems communicate locally to maintain speed and consistency. That modular approach makes your setup easier to maintain and less prone to failure from outside disruptions.</p>    <h3>
