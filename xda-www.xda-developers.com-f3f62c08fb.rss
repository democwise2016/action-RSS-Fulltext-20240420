<p>Search is one of the most important tools of <em>any</em> language model these days, but particularly so in the case of a local language model. When a model is trained, it uses a "knowledge cut-off," meaning that the corpus of data that it used to build its knowledge only goes to a certain point. If an album from your favorite artist just came out, and you want to ask about it, a model without search capabilities will not even know that it exists and will either give a bogus answer, or say that it has no knowledge about it. Even the biggest and most powerful language models suffer from these cut-off dates, with GPT-5's cut-off being in October 2024 and Gemini 2.5 Pro's cut-off being in January 2025. That's why both of these models can search the web to fill those knowledge gaps, even if it requires you to tell them to search the web sometimes.</p>    <p>A local language model, by default, doesn't have that capability. Not only that, given their small size comparatively, they often lack a lot of information that might normally be in the training data of significantly larger models, so even asking about an album from your favorite artist (that may have been released a few years ago) could still result in completely incorrect information. This problem becomes even more apparent when using a language model in a rapidly changing or growing space, such as development. Best practices in the language of your choosing could have evolved significantly since the training data of your chosen model was compiled, and it could provide incorrect or out of date guidance as a result.</p>    <p>As a result, search is one of the most powerful tools you can give your local language model. Not only does it allow you to find information that's <em>current</em>, but it can also fill in the gaps of what the language model does and <em>doesn't</em> know. The only thing you need to be aware of is context length: essentially, the search tool will supply the chosen page as text for the LLM to parse and pull the information out of. This uses up a lot of tokens, and a search request can burn a couple of thousand tokens in order to collect all of the information required to answer your query. The two queries above used up 6,825 tokens, which is above the 4,096 default token length that LM Studio chooses. You can increase the context window yourself, but it's something that you'll need to keep in mind.</p>    <p>It's important to stress that search capabilities are not a foolproof way to prevent hallucinations or incorrect information being provided. You should still always sanity check the responses that you get, but it's a quick and easy way to massively improve the quality of your responses.</p>    <h2>

<p>First and foremost, you'll need to either find a SearXNG server that will allow you to use it as an MCP server, or you can host your own. It's not an intensive application at all, so you could host it using Docker on the same PC that you're running your local LLM on. I'm running it in a Proxmox LXC, but you'll need to make sure that SearXNG's JSON output format is enabled. This is in SearXNG's settings.yml file, and all you need to do is add the "json" line and restart the container. You can subvert all of that by just using a public instance of SearXNG instead, though this mitigates some of the privacy benefits of self-hosting and also requires finding an instance that has JSON enabled.</p>    <p>Once you have it set up and ready to go, you'll need to set up the tool in LM Studio, Ollama, or whatever provider you use to run your language models. In LM Studio, you can add the following to mcp.json, while ensuring that you use proper indentation:</p>    <pre>{<br> "mcpServers": {<br> "searxng": {<br> "command": "npx",<br> "args": [<br> "-y",<br> "mcp-searxng"<br> ],<br> "env": {<br> "SEARXNG_URL": "http://192.168.2.109:8888"<br> }<br> }<br> }<br>}<br></pre>    <p>That's literally all you need! Once you've got it added, you can enable the SearXNG MCP server in the sidebar of LM Studio, or enable it on a per-conversation basis. From there, language models that support tool calling can invoke it and use it to find up-to-date information pulled from the web, bypassing the knowledge cut-off and ensuring that the information you get is valid and up to date. If you suspect that something went wrong, you can also click the tool call in the conversation in order to see where exactly the information was pulled from and <em>what</em> it pulled.</p>    <p>SearXNG is incredibly lightweight, to the point that it's honestly a waste <em>not</em> to pair it with your local LLM.

      <![CDATA[<p>Until <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-drove-me-mad-using-macos-first-time/" target="_blank">a year ago</a>, I had only ever used Windows as my desktop operating system, and for the seven or so months after that, my primary platform became macOS. It wasn't until May that I decided (nudged by work) to dive into Linux, making my first experience as intimidating as possible by <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/used-windows-all-life-so-dove-deep-end-tried-arch-linux/" target="_blank">going all-in on Arch Linux</a>.</p>    <p>At the time, I had a lot of grievances with it as a first-timer. Setup seemed unnecessarily complicated, and I can definitely see how it would deter a newcomer from making the switch. But after just a few months, Arch Linux quickly became my favorite distro, and while it may come with some hurdles, I still find it the best option as a Windows convert. It may not be for everyone, but if you're willing to learn a little bit, it quickly becomes less intimidating.</p>    <h2>
Archinstall is a blessing
</h2><h3>
It makes setting up much easier
</h3>

<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-560308609" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-560308609" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-560308609" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-560308609" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-560308609-img" data-gallery-type="">

<p>A typical Arch setup process can be very off-putting. Everything is done in the terminal and there's no clear guidance to get you started unless you look it up online. However, if you do search online for a bit (or read the next few words), you'll quickly learn about <strong>archinstall</strong>. This is a command that launches an installation setup that's more like a GUI. It's still very much like the Terminal in terms of looks, but it makes all the available options readily visible so you can jump into what you need to configure.</p>    <p>Even then, it can still be intimidating, I understand. Archinstall needs to be downloaded, so you still need to connect to the internet using the <strong>iwctl</strong> command if you're using Wi-Fi (a wired connection makes things easier). Plus, archinstall shows so many options that it can still feel overwhelming. But it does give you a place to start, and you can much more easily get a little bit of help from an online guide. Or, what I personally recommend, have a friend help you through the initial setup. Yes, it's a little cumbersome, but frankly, the average Joe would also not be that comfortable installing Windows from scratch, either, so this isn't completely new territory.</p>    <p>If you have any inkling of familiarity with a command line interface and you're willing to put in just a bit of work to learn the process, installing Arch is nowhere near as frustrating as you might think.</p>    <h2>

<p> The Linux kernel is the heart of any Linux distribution, and it gets updated fairly frequently to improve compatibility with a wide range of hardware. However, a lot of the more popular distros can ship with older versions of the Linux kernel, which can mean worse compatibility for newer hardware. For example, when I set up Linux Mint for the first time, Wi-Fi didn't work on my laptop, and I had to use a wired connection to install a newer Linux kernel, which was optional. As a more extreme example, when I tested Tails, it simply wouldn't boot on the last two generations of Intel processors.</p>    <p>Arch usually ships with the latest version of the Linux kernel from the main branch, and updates come out frequently, meaning you're always on the bleeding edge in terms of features, hardware compatibility, and so on. Of course, you could always install an optional kernel update on any other distribution, but Arch usually comes with a very recent version out of the box, so you don't need to worry as much.</p>    <p>And while updates for Arch are frequent — not just for the Linux kernel but for other system packages — they're always optional and easy to manage. A simple command like <strong>sudo pacman -Syu</strong> will update all your system packages in one go, without requiring a reboot. You can restart to apply the updates whenever you're ready.</p>    <h2>

<p>Any Linux distro will allow you to install different desktop environments, but most of them will have a default that you then need to switch from, which means you likely end up choosing a distro that comes with the desktop envirnment you're most likely to like. But by doing so, you may run into the issue above, where said distro has an older Linux kernel, or maybe another downside that makes it less palatable.</p>    <p>With Arch, you choose the desktop environment you want during setup, so you still get the latest Linux kernel, and you can then pair it with any of the desktop environments you prefer. Want something more like Windows? Cinnamon or KDE Plasma may be for you. Looking for something new and heavily customizable? Maybe GNOME is what you need. You can choose any (or all) of these during setup so you get the experience you need without being tied to a distro that may have a lot of other downsides.</p>    <h2>

<p>Even if you find the base Arch release a little too cumbersome, you can get most of the benefits of Arch with a more user-friendly setup by using one of the many Arch-based distros, with one of the best being CachyOS. This distro keeps the same lightweight experience Arch offers, but it comes with a setup UI that makes it even easier to get started so you can choose all the important settings easily. This UI is based on KDE Plasma, but you still get the same freedom of choice for your actual desktop environment, so there's nothing being lost there.</p>    <p>In fact, CachyOS has other benefits, including its own GUI for installing apps out of the box, so you don't even need to install Flatpak (though Bazaar is still a much nicer UI), and more optimizations for specific hardware. But at its core, it still gets all the benefits of Arch, and it works great.</p>    <h3>
It's not for everyone, but it's still great
</h3>
<p>I'm not deluding myself into believing that the vast majority of Windows users can switch to Arch just like that, but I also don't think that same majority would consider switching to Linux at all. If you're seriously considering Linux to begin with, there's no reason Arch or one of its variants shouldn't be one of your top considerations. Personally, base Arch or CachyOS come highly recommended, and whenver I end up setting up a new laptop in the future, that's probably what I'm aiming for. I recommend others do the same.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Until <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-drove-me-mad-using-macos-first-time/" target="_blank">a year ago</a>, I had only ever used Windows as my desktop operating system, and for the seven or so months after that, my primary platform became macOS. It wasn't until May that I decided (nudged by work) to dive into Linux, making my first experience as intimidating as possible by <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/used-windows-all-life-so-dove-deep-end-tried-arch-linux/" target="_blank">going all-in on Arch Linux</a>.</p>    <p>At the time, I had a lot of grievances with it as a first-timer. Setup seemed unnecessarily complicated, and I can definitely see how it would deter a newcomer from making the switch. But after just a few months, Arch Linux quickly became my favorite distro, and while it may come with some hurdles, I still find it the best option as a Windows convert. It may not be for everyone, but if you're willing to learn a little bit, it quickly becomes less intimidating.</p>    <h2>
Archinstall is a blessing
</h2><h3>
It makes setting up much easier

<p>A typical Arch setup process can be very off-putting. Everything is done in the terminal and there's no clear guidance to get you started unless you look it up online. However, if you do search online for a bit (or read the next few words), you'll quickly learn about <strong>archinstall</strong>. This is a command that launches an installation setup that's more like a GUI. It's still very much like the Terminal in terms of looks, but it makes all the available options readily visible so you can jump into what you need to configure.</p>    <p>Even then, it can still be intimidating, I understand. Archinstall needs to be downloaded, so you still need to connect to the internet using the <strong>iwctl</strong> command if you're using Wi-Fi (a wired connection makes things easier). Plus, archinstall shows so many options that it can still feel overwhelming. But it does give you a place to start, and you can much more easily get a little bit of help from an online guide. Or, what I personally recommend, have a friend help you through the initial setup. Yes, it's a little cumbersome, but frankly, the average Joe would also not be that comfortable installing Windows from scratch, either, so this isn't completely new territory.</p>    <p>If you have any inkling of familiarity with a command line interface and you're willing to put in just a bit of work to learn the process, installing Arch is nowhere near as frustrating as you might think.</p>    <h2>

<p>Even if you find the base Arch release a little too cumbersome, you can get most of the benefits of Arch with a more user-friendly setup by using one of the many Arch-based distros, with one of the best being CachyOS. This distro keeps the same lightweight experience Arch offers, but it comes with a setup UI that makes it even easier to get started so you can choose all the important settings easily. This UI is based on KDE Plasma, but you still get the same freedom of choice for your actual desktop environment, so there's nothing being lost there.</p>    <p>In fact, CachyOS has other benefits, including its own GUI for installing apps out of the box, so you don't even need to install Flatpak (though Bazaar is still a much nicer UI), and more optimizations for specific hardware. But at its core, it still gets all the benefits of Arch, and it works great.</p>    <h3>
It's not for everyone, but it's still great
</h3>
<p>I'm not deluding myself into believing that the vast majority of Windows users can switch to Arch just like that, but I also don't think that same majority would consider switching to Linux at all. If you're seriously considering Linux to begin with, there's no reason Arch or one of its variants shouldn't be one of your top considerations. Personally, base Arch or CachyOS come highly recommended, and whenver I end up setting up a new laptop in the future, that's probably what I'm aiming for. I recommend others do the same.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Until <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-drove-me-mad-using-macos-first-time/" target="_blank">a year ago</a>, I had only ever used Windows as my desktop operating system, and for the seven or so months after that, my primary platform became macOS. It wasn't until May that I decided (nudged by work) to dive into Linux, making my first experience as intimidating as possible by <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/used-windows-all-life-so-dove-deep-end-tried-arch-linux/" target="_blank">going all-in on Arch Linux</a>.</p>    <p>At the time, I had a lot of grievances with it as a first-timer. Setup seemed unnecessarily complicated, and I can definitely see how it would deter a newcomer from making the switch. But after just a few months, Arch Linux quickly became my favorite distro, and while it may come with some hurdles, I still find it the best option as a Windows convert. It may not be for everyone, but if you're willing to learn a little bit, it quickly becomes less intimidating.</p>    <h2>
Archinstall is a blessing
</h2><h3>
It makes setting up much easier

<p>A typical Arch setup process can be very off-putting. Everything is done in the terminal and there's no clear guidance to get you started unless you look it up online. However, if you do search online for a bit (or read the next few words), you'll quickly learn about <strong>archinstall</strong>. This is a command that launches an installation setup that's more like a GUI. It's still very much like the Terminal in terms of looks, but it makes all the available options readily visible so you can jump into what you need to configure.</p>    <p>Even then, it can still be intimidating, I understand. Archinstall needs to be downloaded, so you still need to connect to the internet using the <strong>iwctl</strong> command if you're using Wi-Fi (a wired connection makes things easier). Plus, archinstall shows so many options that it can still feel overwhelming. But it does give you a place to start, and you can much more easily get a little bit of help from an online guide. Or, what I personally recommend, have a friend help you through the initial setup. Yes, it's a little cumbersome, but frankly, the average Joe would also not be that comfortable installing Windows from scratch, either, so this isn't completely new territory.</p>    <p>If you have any inkling of familiarity with a command line interface and you're willing to put in just a bit of work to learn the process, installing Arch is nowhere near as frustrating as you might think.</p>    <h2>

<p>Recently, my colleague Ty Sherback wrote about <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/5-reasons-why-linux-beginners-should-be-using-flatpak/" target="_blank">why Flatpak is such a great tool</a> to have for Linux newcomers, and I absolutely agree. Flatpak is a package management system used for installing, updating, or removing apps, and it's designed with a big focus on ease of use. Unlike most Linux package managers, Flatpak often comes with a GUI for installing your apps, or has apps designed to work with it, such as Bazaar or Discover.</p>    <p>Combining Flatpak with these two apps gives you a clean, effective interface for installing apps that anyone can use. Bazaar, particularly, has a very modern-feeling and clean UI that has the visual flair you'd like in a modern storefront, with a Discover page making it easy to find new apps, easy search, and so on. It's a very nice storefront for a beginner.</p>    <p>Flatpak has been growing pretty quickly in popularity, so a lot of apps you might want are already available on the primary Flathub source, so you can find things like web browser, office suites, image editors like GIMP, and much more through Flatpak. What that means is you shouldn't need to spend that much time using the terminal to get the apps you need.</p>    <h2>
Frequent (but optional) updates
</h2><h3>
Arch is on the bleeding edge
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of a Terminal windows on KDE Plasma showing the command for updating all system packages" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/pacman-syu-on-arch.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">

<p> The Linux kernel is the heart of any Linux distribution, and it gets updated fairly frequently to improve compatibility with a wide range of hardware. However, a lot of the more popular distros can ship with older versions of the Linux kernel, which can mean worse compatibility for newer hardware. For example, when I set up Linux Mint for the first time, Wi-Fi didn't work on my laptop, and I had to use a wired connection to install a newer Linux kernel, which was optional. As a more extreme example, when I tested Tails, it simply wouldn't boot on the last two generations of Intel processors.</p>    <p>Arch usually ships with the latest version of the Linux kernel from the main branch, and updates come out frequently, meaning you're always on the bleeding edge in terms of features, hardware compatibility, and so on. Of course, you could always install an optional kernel update on any other distribution, but Arch usually comes with a very recent version out of the box, so you don't need to worry as much.</p>    <p>And while updates for Arch are frequent — not just for the Linux kernel but for other system packages — they're always optional and easy to manage. A simple command like <strong>sudo pacman -Syu</strong> will update all your system packages in one go, without requiring a reboot. You can restart to apply the updates whenever you're ready.</p>    <h2>

<p>Even if you find the base Arch release a little too cumbersome, you can get most of the benefits of Arch with a more user-friendly setup by using one of the many Arch-based distros, with one of the best being CachyOS. This distro keeps the same lightweight experience Arch offers, but it comes with a setup UI that makes it even easier to get started so you can choose all the important settings easily. This UI is based on KDE Plasma, but you still get the same freedom of choice for your actual desktop environment, so there's nothing being lost there.</p>    <p>In fact, CachyOS has other benefits, including its own GUI for installing apps out of the box, so you don't even need to install Flatpak (though Bazaar is still a much nicer UI), and more optimizations for specific hardware. But at its core, it still gets all the benefits of Arch, and it works great.</p>    <h3>
It's not for everyone, but it's still great
</h3>
<p>I'm not deluding myself into believing that the vast majority of Windows users can switch to Arch just like that, but I also don't think that same majority would consider switching to Linux at all. If you're seriously considering Linux to begin with, there's no reason Arch or one of its variants shouldn't be one of your top considerations. Personally, base Arch or CachyOS come highly recommended, and whenver I end up setting up a new laptop in the future, that's probably what I'm aiming for. I recommend others do the same.</p>

<p>The main reason I picked up a NAS in the first place was to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/want-to-set-up-a-home-media-server-heres-everything-you-need/" target="_blank">create a home media server</a>, to back up the stacks of physical media that I knew would eventually degrade, and to reduce our streaming subscription costs. Over the years, I've <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-add-ons-for-media-server/" target="_blank">expanded the functionality to make it more user friendly</a>, but it's still used for media. Back then, the amount of personal data I had to keep secure was significantly lower, with easily replaceable game installations being most of my data use.</p>    <p>Nowadays, I've got our family devices backed up to the NAS, whether mobile, Windows, or macOS, along with backups of the cloud storage providers I also subscribe to. That might seem like an odd choice, but I've found that with the mix of devices we own, it's easier to keep some level of cloud subscription for the native solution for each platform, back it up to the NAS, and occasionally trim it from the cloud so that I don't have to increase service tiers. That way, I don't have to worry about home security for sharing the NAS as cloud storage, and more importantly, nobody in my family has to worry about which app is being used to back up data.</p>    <h3>

<p>One of my NAS devices has a quad-core Xeon CPU inside and is currently powering my home lab experiments and being a secondary backup for my primary NAS.

<p>When I first started using Plex, it was self-hosted on my gaming PC, with an 8TB hard drive storing media while the rest of the PC was used for work and games.

<p>I'm a big smart device user, although I prefer to keep most things manually controlled with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/minimal-home-assistant-automations-maximum-impact-smart-home/" target="_blank">minimal automations set up</a>. To free my smartphone from the dozens of apps that those devices need, I've got <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/home-assistant-add-ons-you-need-before-anything-else/" target="_blank">Home Assistant running in a VM</a> on one of my NAS devices. Now I've got a single point of call to control my smart home, that doesn't rely on the cloud, internet connectivity, or any external services to work. As long as my internal network and NAS have power, my smart home is still smart, and that's the way I like it.</p>    <h3>
My home isn't a home without a home lab
</h3>
<p>One of my NAS devices has a quad-core Xeon CPU inside and is currently powering my home lab experiments and being a secondary backup for my primary NAS. That's going to change at some point soon when I build a workstation or server (depending on which chassis I end up picking up), because I'm straining the bounds of what that CPU can handle, and it also can't use a discrete GPU, but for now, my NAS is running the show. I've become very attached to my mad science experimentation, and it wasn't possible without a centralized, always-on network device in my home.</p>    <h3>
It enabled me to slim down my PC
</h3>

<p>When I first started using Plex, it was self-hosted on my gaming PC, with an 8TB hard drive storing media while the rest of the PC was used for work and games. The bottleneck there was that whenever someone was streaming media, my Ethernet connection crawled to a halt for anything else, including latency-dependent multiplayer gaming. Offloading documents, media files, and everything else that wasn't an app or game to the NAS has made the amount of storage I need to a point where it's easily handled by one or two M.2 NVMe drives, while mounting the NAS as a network share handles everything else.</p>    <h3>
My NAS is the heart of my smart home and backup solution
</h3>
<p>When I think about all the devices in my home, and which are essential, my NAS enclosures are at the top of the list. They came with a hefty initial investment, and every few years I need to replace some of the drives, but <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-i-stopped-paying-for-after-getting-a-nas/" target="_blank">they've consistently saved me time, worry, and money</a> while I've had them running. It's almost time for me to add another enclosure to the mix because the six-bay HDD unit is slowly filling up, and I need more bays to adjust to my ever-increasing data hoarding. I'll never not have one plugged into my home network, and it's one of the things I recommend to everyone to purchase, set up, and use daily.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>Like millions of others, I have banked on OneNote as my central hub for ideas and information for what feels like forever. It’s a fantastic tool, until it suddenly isn’t. Despite being a user for all these years, I’m still dealing with the same, single, crucial flaw that turns a smooth workday into a moment of panic: sync reliability.</p>    <p>It's the gut-wrenching moment when I switch from my desktop to my phone and realize my last hour of work has simply vanished, or been overwritten by an older version.</p>    <p>For a cloud application that’s been around for over 20 years, the fact that I frequently lose changes and new notes when simply switching devices is unbelievable, and it’s the one crucial problem Microsoft still hasn’t fixed.</p>    <h2>
Sync failure is data loss
</h2><h3>
Not just slow, but destructive
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1912379921" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1912379921" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1912379921" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1912379921" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1912379921-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>This is where the frustration boils over. The core issue with OneNote isn’t a mere inconvenience; for me, sync failure is data loss, plain and simple. I’m fine with notebooks and pages taking a while to load, but sync problems are where I lose my patience.</p>    <p>Here’s a perfect example that happened to me last month: I was in a crucial client meeting and took detailed notes on my HP Spectre. The meeting ended, I closed the lid, and headed back home.</p>    <p>When I had a Teams meeting with my colleagues, I opened OneNote on my iPad and waited a while for the note to load. The section where I spent 45 minutes filling was nowhere to be found. The app displayed the notebook’s state from before the meeting.</p>    <p>I spent the first five minutes of the meeting frantically typing a summary from memory instead of having a focused discussion. That’s a professional failure caused entirely by a product flaw.</p>    <p>It’s not just OneNote, either. I face the exact same reliability gap with Sticky Notes, another Microsoft product. I often use the Outlook web app on my Mac to manage emails and glance at my Sticky Notes, but it often takes a frustratingly long time to load, sometimes displaying outdated notes or nothing at all.</p>    <p>This lack of reliable, real-time data handoff across Microsoft’s own ecosystem is baffling. I shouldn’t have to doubt if the most basic function of a cloud tool (keeping my data accessible) will actually work.</p>    <h2>
The historical context
</h2><h3>
20 years of patches, no cure
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="managing finances in OneNote" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/08/surprisingly-ways-to-use-onenote-4.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Sync issue isn’t a new bug that just popped up last week; this problem is baked into OneNote’s history. When I think about it, the issues probably go back to how OneNote started – it was a program built for the desktop, not the cloud.</p>    <p>It wasn’t designed from day one to handle real-time, cross-device switching the way modern apps are. But then again, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-onenote-evernote-side-by-side-for-a-month/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> lands in the same category and the green elephant syncs notes across devices just fine. It feels like Microsoft took this old core and just tried to force the cloud onto it with patch after patch.</p>    <p>I remember all the confusion over the years: we had the classic OneNote 2016 desktop version, then Microsoft pushed the simplified OneNote for Windows 10 app, and then they switched back again.</p>    <p>Each time they changed which version they were focusing on, I felt like the sync got another hit.</p>    <h2>
Microsoft can deliver a class-leading sync setup
</h2><h3>
Look at Microsoft Loop
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Column types in Loop" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/features-microsoft-loop-needs-to-become-productivity-powerhouse-8.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> This is the point that makes me most frustrated: Microsoft knows how to build real-time, perfect sync. The evidence is right there in their newest apps.</p>    <p>Look at <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-loop-is-an-underrated-productivity-gem/" target="_blank">Microsoft Loop</a>. It’s basically built on the promise of perfectly shared, instantly updated content. When I complete a Loop page with all the relevant details, all those databases, blocks, Mermaid charts, and embedded OneDrive files are right up there on my iPad.</p>    <p>Of course, I don’t want to ditch OneNote in favor of Loop. All I want is for them to take that modern Loop syncing engine and put it into the OneNote structure I already rely on.</p>    <h2>
The rivals are catching up
</h2><h3>
Time to look for alternatives
</h3>

<p> Sync issue isn’t a new bug that just popped up last week; this problem is baked into OneNote’s history. When I think about it, the issues probably go back to how OneNote started – it was a program built for the desktop, not the cloud.</p>    <p>It wasn’t designed from day one to handle real-time, cross-device switching the way modern apps are. But then again, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-onenote-evernote-side-by-side-for-a-month/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> lands in the same category and the green elephant syncs notes across devices just fine. It feels like Microsoft took this old core and just tried to force the cloud onto it with patch after patch.</p>    <p>I remember all the confusion over the years: we had the classic OneNote 2016 desktop version, then Microsoft pushed the simplified OneNote for Windows 10 app, and then they switched back again.</p>    <p>Each time they changed which version they were focusing on, I felt like the sync got another hit.</p>    <h2>

<p> This is the point that makes me most frustrated: Microsoft knows how to build real-time, perfect sync.

<p>I used to keep every note, draft, project, and list inside Notion. All my pages lived in one workspace, but it quickly became like a messy pile of digital junk. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/notion-is-jack-of-all-trades-and-master-of-none/" target="_blank">Notion has a lot of muscle</a>, but it can still feel like dragging a suitcase of bricks because there’s just so much going on at once. So a tool that was supposed to help me organize my life just ended up being another point of friction.</p>    <p>I’ve tried several <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/swapped-notion-for-open-source-alternative/" target="_blank">Notion alternatives</a> at this point, and have come across some true gems. And eventually, I discovered Capacities. It’s considered one of the top PKM apps out there, so I had to give it a go, and it ended up really surprising me. It has a slightly similar structure to Notion, but with many key differences, and those are ultimately what made me want to switch. Here’s how my journey with it has been so far…</p>    <h2>
The UI is much better
</h2><h3>
Capacities is a calmer and more intuitive workspace
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1729344316" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1729344316" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1729344316" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1729344316" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1729344316-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Capacities does make the onboarding longer than it needs to be, but once I was in, it felt worth it. I was met with a much cleaner and simpler layout than Notion, and immediately felt like I could dive in without getting overwhelmed. The sidebar is minimal, with your workspaces at the top and options to create new content underneath. The first thing you’ll be directed to is the calendar board, which you can view by day, three days, week, or month. It’s an excellent way to get an immediate overview of past, current, and upcoming projects without having to go digging for them.</p>    <p>From the New Content button, you can create pages, tables, and insert images, links, and so on. Each content piece you create gets grouped under a section called Objects (more on those later). And each one opens to its own page which you can elaborate on with a title and text. Just like Notion, the text area lets you use the slash command to insert headers, tables, lists, code, and more. Plus, you can link to other pages, insert web links, and create tags.</p>    <p>And that’s all there is to it. It feels a little more barebones on the surface, but that’s only because Capacities trims the visual noise. Everything you could need for project and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/found-perfect-knowledge-management-app/" target="_blank">knowledge management</a> is within reach in a few clicks; you don’t have to wonder where anything is hiding or watch a million tutorials to learn how to use it.</p>    <h2>
Objects instead of folders or databases
</h2><h3>
It’s a different approach to task management
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-561759479" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-561759479" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-561759479" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-561759479" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-561759479-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Objects is Capacities’ signature feature. As abovementioned, every type of content you create in Capacities is an “object”. They’re reusable, customizable, and linkable entries that comprise all the content you create in the app. The most notable difference about objects is that they replace folders as well as databases.</p>    <p>Objects are grouped into categories, namely Tables, Pages, Weblinks, Images, Meetings, and so on. Within each category, you’ll find the same objects in their respective groups. For example, every table I make goes into the Table category, each image I insert goes into the Image category. From there, I can also sort them into collections or interlink them across my workspace, effectively creating a database. Furthermore, every object category has a custom view for the entries, so you can display them as a list, as a kanban board, or as a wall with cards.</p>    <p>There are a bunch of object templates to help you get started or to save time. For example, the Project template already has Status, Time Frame, and Collaborators property fields. But the cool thing is that you can completely customize objects with your own properties, such as Number, Date, Checkbox, Label, and more. This system is much more approachable than Notion’s databases.</p>    <h2>
It's great for time-blocking
</h2><h3>
I use Groups and the Calendar view to do it
</h3>

<p> Although Capacities doesn’t have a dedicated time-blocking feature, you can still set up a similar structure with the Group function in the calendar view – this is mainly how I’ve been using the app. After creating an object, use the slash command to bring up the command options and select Group. This is essentially a block element; you can make as many of them as you want, and insert more elements inside them to create a hierarchical system. Having these vertical stacks of “blocks” is similar to time-blocking.</p>    <p>This is also where Capacities’ calendar view comes into play, because viewing my time blocks is better in the day-week-month format. It gives me a better overview of how my tasks and projects fit into my weeks, as opposed to viewing them as single pages. Everything looks clean and minimal, making my tasks simpler to navigate than in Notion.</p>    <h2>

<p>I used to keep every note, draft, project, and list inside Notion. All my pages lived in one workspace, but it quickly became like a messy pile of digital junk. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/notion-is-jack-of-all-trades-and-master-of-none/" target="_blank">Notion has a lot of muscle</a>, but it can still feel like dragging a suitcase of bricks because there’s just so much going on at once.

And eventually, I discovered Capacities. It’s considered one of the top PKM apps out there, so I had to give it a go, and it ended up really surprising me. It has a slightly similar structure to Notion, but with many key differences, and those are ultimately what made me want to switch. Here’s how my journey with it has been so far…</p>    <h2>

Capacities is a calmer and more intuitive workspace

<p>Capacities does make the onboarding longer than it needs to be, but once I was in, it felt worth it. I was met with a much cleaner and simpler layout than Notion, and immediately felt like I could dive in without getting overwhelmed. The sidebar is minimal, with your workspaces at the top and options to create new content underneath. The first thing you’ll be directed to is the calendar board, which you can view by day, three days, week, or month. It’s an excellent way to get an immediate overview of past, current, and upcoming projects without having to go digging for them.</p>    <p>From the New Content button, you can create pages, tables, and insert images, links, and so on. Each content piece you create gets grouped under a section called Objects (more on those later). And each one opens to its own page which you can elaborate on with a title and text. Just like Notion, the text area lets you use the slash command to insert headers, tables, lists, code, and more. Plus, you can link to other pages, insert web links, and create tags.</p>    <p>And that’s all there is to it. It feels a little more barebones on the surface, but that’s only because Capacities trims the visual noise. Everything you could need for project and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/found-perfect-knowledge-management-app/" target="_blank">knowledge management</a> is within reach in a few clicks; you don’t have to wonder where anything is hiding or watch a million tutorials to learn how to use it.</p>    <h2>

<p>Objects is Capacities’ signature feature. As abovementioned, every type of content you create in Capacities is an “object”. They’re reusable, customizable, and linkable entries that comprise all the content you create in the app. The most notable difference about objects is that they replace folders as well as databases.</p>    <p>Objects are grouped into categories, namely Tables, Pages, Weblinks, Images, Meetings, and so on. Within each category, you’ll find the same objects in their respective groups. For example, every table I make goes into the Table category, each image I insert goes into the Image category. From there, I can also sort them into collections or interlink them across my workspace, effectively creating a database. Furthermore, every object category has a custom view for the entries, so you can display them as a list, as a kanban board, or as a wall with cards.</p>    <p>There are a bunch of object templates to help you get started or to save time. For example, the Project template already has Status, Time Frame, and Collaborators property fields. But the cool thing is that you can completely customize objects with your own properties, such as Number, Date, Checkbox, Label, and more. This system is much more approachable than Notion’s databases.</p>    <h2>

      <![CDATA[<p>Diagnosing a PC performance issue can be tricky, especially if you suspect memory is involved. Chances are, you've heard the advice of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/upgrading-to-64-gb-of-ram-was-one-of-best-upgrades-ive-done/" target="_blank">"just add more RAM"</a>, which is a blanket fix that's as old as PC hardware. It's been around since the days of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/installing-windows-xp-on-modern-system/" target="_blank">XP</a>, and it's not entirely incorrect. Modern systems are far better at managing memory than they used to be, and adding <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/my-next-ram-upgrade-will-not-be-64gb-kit/" target="_blank">more RAM often does little</a> unless you’re running into specific bottlenecks. Heavy multitasking and professional workloads require boatloads of memory; if your PC is used for more than just gaming, you might need to add a couple of sticks to your system.</p>    <h2>
What RAM is actually responsible for
</h2><h3>
Quick access to data your CPU needs
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A top-down shot of RAM modules installed on a motherboard." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/11/teamgroup-t-force-xtreem-argb-ddr5-ram-installed-top.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>RAM essentially acts as your system’s short-term workspace. It stores the data your CPU needs to access immediately, and it's far quicker than any kind of non-volatile storage. Once you run out of RAM, you dip into what's called "swap" which is essentially using a non-volatile storage drive like an SSD or HDD to store the data that would otherwise be located in RAM.</p>    <p>Swap is relatively expensive computationally, meaning it's far slower and more intensive for your CPU to get the data it needs from it rather than the dedicated pool of system memory. This is why increasing RAM can sometimes help performance, because if your system is dipping into swap often, your system can slow to a crawl.</p>    <h2>
When adding more RAM won't help
</h2><h3>
The point of diminishing returns comes fast
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1982237926" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1982237926" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1982237926" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1982237926" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1982237926-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>When your PC is under your usual, everyday workload, if you open Task Manager and see that it's using no more than around 60–70% of what you have, adding more RAM probably won't help. Windows is pretty aggressive with how it caches data too, so if you're not sitting close to max capacity in the normal workloads you perform, your bottleneck is likely elsewhere.</p>    <p>Before rushing out to get more RAM, check your CPU temperatures.

      <![CDATA[<p>Before learning about containers, I used to dedicate a single virtual machine to every service I wanted to run, which is hugely inefficient. Compared to fully-fledged virtual machines, containers are lighter, more specialized, flexible, and easier to set up.</p>    <p>Still, I struggle to choose between my main PC and my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/you-can-use-a-raspberry-pi-as-a-decent-home-server/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> 4B whenever a new self-hosting project lands on my desk. Known as a single-board computer (SBC), the Raspberry Pi is often sufficient for most of my low-level self-hosting tasks. So, I listed the pros and cons of each to remind myself for next time. Most of my experiments so far have been with Docker and the Raspberry Pi, though the same ideas apply to other products.</p>    <p>Also, while cloud hosting is always an option, it defeats the point of self-hosting, so that’s off the table for the scope of this article.</p>    <h2>
Performance
</h2><h3>
Is it right for the project?
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A screenshot of a local jellyfin server running inside a windows vm" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/xda-jellyfin-vm-example.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<figcaption>This VM contains the Jellyfin server I use to try out new stuff and research my articles.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</div>
</div>
<p> For simple self-hosted media servers with only a few users, either containers or an SBC fit the bill. All my services run happily inside either virtual machines or containers on my main PC, which has an Intel Core i9-12900K and 32GB of RAM. But for logging, analytics, timing-sensitive control setups, or larger media servers with dozens of users, the choice of host matters more.</p>    <p>The more container services that are running on a single device, the more resources are shared between them. Stretch the resources too thin, and everything slows to a crawl. Dedicating a single SBC to a single service mitigates the issue somewhat since they allocate all their resources to a single task. Still, they’re susceptible to slowdowns if the project grows complex enough, as the SBC’s strengths—running low-powered hardware on a budget and sipping power—also limit its performance.</p>    <p>Thankfully, both setups can scale. With SBCs, you can cluster multiple boards to distribute the load. However, adding more boards increases complexity and really only benefits parallelizable workloads. Also, it's difficult to scale individual components, like memory, in SBC clusters. For single-host systems, scaling performance is limited by compatibility and the number of parts they can accept.</p>    <p>The silver lining is that nothing is permanent. If one setup doesn’t work out, there are many ways to migrate between setups. Containers are made to be portable, so migrating them between machines with the same architecture should be smooth (otherwise, it will need to be emulated or rebuilt). And if dedicating a single SBC to a service leaves too much performance headroom, consolidating the light services to a central host should be simple, too.</p>    <h2>
Points of failure
</h2><h3>
Centralized convenience or distributed redundancy?
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Raspberry Pi Cluster Case by Intisy" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/raspberry-pi-cluster-case-by-intisy.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
<small>Credit:&nbsp;Intisy/MakerWorld</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> In a multi-container setup, if the central host machine goes down, so do all its services. That's less of an issue with a discrete SBC setup. If one board fails, the failure is confined to a single device and service, not the entire setup. Also, setting up physical SBC compute clusters is a good way to both improve performance and add redundancy. If one member device of the cluster breaks, others can fill in without any downtime. And if it needs more performance, just add more boards.</p>    <h2>
Management
</h2><h3>
Both are easy to handle
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="screenshot of docker swarm speedtest tracker service page" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/07/docker-swarm-speedtest-tracker-service-page.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
<figcaption>A Docker Swarm speedtest tracker service page.</figcaption>
</div>
</div>
<p> Management is straightforward either way. You can administer an SBC cluster from one of its nodes, and container setups can be orchestrated with tools like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-these-docker-containers-cant-live-without-them/" target="_blank">Docker Swarm</a> or managed directly from the central host.</p>    <h2>
Space and setup
</h2><h3>
Tiny boards, tidy spaces
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A Raspberry Pi 4B next to a standard-sized library card." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/dsc06960.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
<figcaption>The Raspberry Pi 4B is barely larger than a credit card.</figcaption>
</div>
</div>
<p> SBCs are tiny. Compared to laptops and even NAS units, they’re far easier to hide away. Their low power profile (The Raspberry Pi 5 uses just around 12W under load) also means they can stay on permanently without raising the power bill. Better yet, for low-power tasks, they can run fanless (though they'll still need extra cooling for sustained high loads), staying completely silent. Once they’re set up, they can run headless (without a monitor or input devices), saving even more space.</p>    <p>Having a central host is a little different. Certain operating systems (looking at you, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-things-microsoft-needs-to-prioritize-on-windows-if-they-want-to-stop-bleeding-users-to-linux/" target="_blank">Windows 11</a>) need a periodic restart to work properly, which adds downtime. Also, desktop processors need stronger coolers and power supplies, leading to higher noise and power consumption. However, hosting containers inside existing machines also saves space that would otherwise be occupied by SBCs.</p>    <h2>
Cost
</h2><h3>
No clear winner
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-694037502" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-694037502" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-694037502" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-694037502" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-694037502-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>“Balance” is a recurring theme here, and cost might be the trickiest factor of all. It’s natural to assume that containers would be cheaper, and for smaller home labs, that’s often true. But as workloads increase, you’ll eventually hit a performance ceiling, and upgrading components can quickly get expensive.</p>    <p>SBCs, on the other hand, are inexpensive. The Raspberry Pi 4B costs between $35 and $75, including the motherboard, CPU, and memory. If dedicating one per service feels ostentatious, clustering them is always an option with a bit of patience. Besides the boards themselves, the main investments are storage and setup time.</p>    <p>Repairability is another factor. While you can’t replace individual components on an SBC, the boards themselves are cheap enough that replacing one doesn’t hurt the wallet as much as PC hardware.</p>    <h3>
Does it need to be a choice?
</h3>
<p>Just like everything else in technology, the answer is never clear-cut. Choosing between a centralized host and distributing services across several discrete hardware is a challenge faced in humble home lab setups and massive organizations around the world every day.</p>    <p>Thankfully, we aren’t dealing with infrastructure worth millions of dollars, so we have the liberty to experiment. So far, I’ve been learning how to set up different services inside containers and, if I ever want to, set them up again on an SBC. I understand that some won’t want to go through the trouble of doing the same thing twice, but for me, it's a necessary step in learning. Besides, it's just plain fun.</p>    <p>And maybe there’s no need to choose. After all, containers can be hosted on anything, including an SBC or SBC cluster. There are plenty of great tutorials on setting up my own, and I'm pretty excited to build one in the near future. Finally, NAS is a third great option. To find out why, read <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/my-nas-is-essential-for-these-6-self-hosted-services/" target="_blank">this article </a>by Ayush Pande.</p>]]>

<p> For simple self-hosted media servers with only a few users, either containers or an SBC fit the bill. All my services run happily inside either virtual machines or containers on my main PC, which has an Intel Core i9-12900K and 32GB of RAM. But for logging, analytics, timing-sensitive control setups, or larger media servers with dozens of users, the choice of host matters more.</p>    <p>The more container services that are running on a single device, the more resources are shared between them. Stretch the resources too thin, and everything slows to a crawl. Dedicating a single SBC to a single service mitigates the issue somewhat since they allocate all their resources to a single task. Still, they’re susceptible to slowdowns if the project grows complex enough, as the SBC’s strengths—running low-powered hardware on a budget and sipping power—also limit its performance.</p>    <p>Thankfully, both setups can scale. With SBCs, you can cluster multiple boards to distribute the load. However, adding more boards increases complexity and really only benefits parallelizable workloads. Also, it's difficult to scale individual components, like memory, in SBC clusters. For single-host systems, scaling performance is limited by compatibility and the number of parts they can accept.</p>    <p>The silver lining is that nothing is permanent. If one setup doesn’t work out, there are many ways to migrate between setups. Containers are made to be portable, so migrating them between machines with the same architecture should be smooth (otherwise, it will need to be emulated or rebuilt). And if dedicating a single SBC to a service leaves too much performance headroom, consolidating the light services to a central host should be simple, too.</p>    <h2>

<p> In a multi-container setup, if the central host machine goes down, so do all its services. That's less of an issue with a discrete SBC setup. If one board fails, the failure is confined to a single device and service, not the entire setup. Also, setting up physical SBC compute clusters is a good way to both improve performance and add redundancy. If one member device of the cluster breaks, others can fill in without any downtime. And if it needs more performance, just add more boards.</p>    <h2>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before learning about containers, I used to dedicate a single virtual machine to every service I wanted to run, which is hugely inefficient. Compared to fully-fledged virtual machines, containers are lighter, more specialized, flexible, and easier to set up.</p>    <p>Still, I struggle to choose between my main PC and my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/you-can-use-a-raspberry-pi-as-a-decent-home-server/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> 4B whenever a new self-hosting project lands on my desk. Known as a single-board computer (SBC), the Raspberry Pi is often sufficient for most of my low-level self-hosting tasks. So, I listed the pros and cons of each to remind myself for next time. Most of my experiments so far have been with Docker and the Raspberry Pi, though the same ideas apply to other products.</p>    <p>Also, while cloud hosting is always an option, it defeats the point of self-hosting, so that’s off the table for the scope of this article.</p>    <h2>

What is Dockpeek?
</h2><h3>
I never realized how much I wanted a lightweight way to manage my containers
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="dockpeek dashboard" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/dockpeek-dashboard.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>I've used many Docker management tools, from <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-ditched-portainer-komodo/" target="_blank">Komodo</a> to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-why-use-this-app-to-manage-docker-containers/" target="_blank">Portainer</a>, and they all feel like I'm juggling a chain of recursive containers. I already know where my compose files are; I've got them open in VS Code to make changes. I know where my mapped storage folders are, because I can see them in File Explorer. I can monitor memory and CPU usage easily because I'm on the same machine, and having these replicated on my dashboard bugs me.</p>    <p>I've come to the realization that I'm probably atypical in this regards, because <em>every management tool behaves like this</em>. They all stack menus upon menus to to show which containers are running, where your images are, and any little piece of information about your containers that the developer thinks you might want to see. Then you get resource usage and other information on the container name, and it all starts to feel like I'm adding notes in the margins of a book.</p>    <p>I can't work like this. It's the same overwhelm of information that makes Google Analytics or <em>any other monitoring tool</em> impossible for my brain to handle until I've added filters, restrictions, and other ways of pruning down the data so that I have just enough to get me by. And that's what Dockpeek does for me. It shows my containers, the ports I can access them from, if they're running or not, and if they need an updated image.</p>    <h3>
It's easy to see logs and what's going on
</h3>

<div>
<img alt="dockpeek showing logs for a container" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/dockpeek-logs.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Oh, and logs. The crucial thing, that on most Docker dashboards, I need to click through several layers of tabs to get to. These logs are in a readable, large font, and I can get to them with a single click. I don't want to learn a multi-stage navigation for every container to figure out how to get to the logs and then get from those logs to somewhere I can fix the errors. I just want logs.</p>

Why is Dockpeek better for me?
</h2><h3>
Exhibit A: Docker Desktop and its bloat
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-524826571" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-524826571" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-524826571" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-524826571" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-524826571-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>I'm calling out Docker Desktop specifically, but Podman is just as bad. Even with my glasses on, I can't read half of the text on the interface, and the logging section is even worse. If I can't read it, <em>why are you insisting that you show it to me</em>? </p>    <p>I know I sound like an old man shouting at the sky, but these tools are supposed to make container management easier, not add another stack of cognitive load that I need to work through and squint at to see. The closest to a usable dashboard I've used is Dockge, which, at the very least, keeps the font size large. But again, it duplicates functionality that I have elsewhere and that I'm already comfortable working in.</p>    <h3>
Why do I need all of these other things?
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="docker desktop running on windows with a variety of containers" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/docker-desktop-running-on-windows-with-a-variety-of-containers.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>I prefer to start any containerized task with a compose file, and I tend to do the rest of the process manually as well. I don't like context-switching between text-based management and buttons, and I've always had an issue with systems like Synology Container Manager, where everything is done in forms to be filled out. I don't need to be able to search through a registry of existing Docker images, because I'm usually working directly from the directions on the Github page. My workflow just doesn't need the layers of functionality that most Docker dashboards provide, and I'm okay with that. I know what works for my brain and any time I have to work against that, I end up spending more time fighting with my tools and workflow than actually doing the thing I set out to accomplish.</p>    <h3>
Dockpeek has made container management make sense to me
</h3>
<p>When I'm handling Docker containers to build out home lab experiments, I'm a man of simple needs. I need a Terminal, a text editor, and a dashboard that can show me which pieces of my stack are running, and any logs that I'll need to figure out why something isn't working as intended. I don't want to replicate any of these features inside my dashboard, I don't even want to have buttons to restart my containers, because I'd rather use the command line.</p>    <p>Dockpeek gives me just enough information to know what's going on while I'm working, without having the cognitive load associated with navigating a cluttered interface. And that's all I want, a visual reminder of what's working, and a button to pull the latest version of each container.</p>]]>

I can monitor memory and CPU usage easily because I'm on the same machine, and having these replicated on my dashboard bugs me.</p>    <p>I've come to the realization that I'm probably atypical in this regards, because <em>every management tool behaves like this</em>. They all stack menus upon menus to to show which containers are running, where your images are, and any little piece of information about your containers that the developer thinks you might want to see. Then you get resource usage and other information on the container name, and it all starts to feel like I'm adding notes in the margins of a book.</p>    <p>I can't work like this. It's the same overwhelm of information that makes Google Analytics or <em>any other monitoring tool</em> impossible for my brain to handle until I've added filters, restrictions, and other ways of pruning down the data so that I have just enough to get me by. And that's what Dockpeek does for me. It shows my containers, the ports I can access them from, if they're running or not, and if they need an updated image.</p>    <h3>
It's easy to see logs and what's going on
</h3>

<p>Oh, and logs. The crucial thing, that on most Docker dashboards, I need to click through several layers of tabs to get to. These logs are in a readable, large font, and I can get to them with a single click. I don't want to learn a multi-stage navigation for every container to figure out how to get to the logs and then get from those logs to somewhere I can fix the errors. I just want logs.</p>

<p>I'm calling out Docker Desktop specifically, but Podman is just as bad. Even with my glasses on, I can't read half of the text on the interface, and the logging section is even worse.

The closest to a usable dashboard I've used is Dockge, which, at the very least, keeps the font size large. But again, it duplicates functionality that I have elsewhere and that I'm already comfortable working in.</p>    <h3>

<p>I prefer to start any containerized task with a compose file, and I tend to do the rest of the process manually as well.

I don't need to be able to search through a registry of existing Docker images, because I'm usually working directly from the directions on the Github page. My workflow just doesn't need the layers of functionality that most Docker dashboards provide, and I'm okay with that. I know what works for my brain and any time I have to work against that, I end up spending more time fighting with my tools and workflow than actually doing the thing I set out to accomplish.</p>    <h3>
Dockpeek has made container management make sense to me

<p>When I'm handling Docker containers to build out home lab experiments, I'm a man of simple needs. I need a Terminal, a text editor, and a dashboard that can show me which pieces of my stack are running, and any logs that I'll need to figure out why something isn't working as intended. I don't want to replicate any of these features inside my dashboard, I don't even want to have buttons to restart my containers, because I'd rather use the command line.</p>    <p>Dockpeek gives me just enough information to know what's going on while I'm working, without having the cognitive load associated with navigating a cluttered interface. And that's all I want, a visual reminder of what's working, and a button to pull the latest version of each container.</p>]]>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I can fully get on board with the lightweight workloads that containerized services provide, I've always had a problem with the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/single-docker-container-that-made-me-home-lab-power-user/" target="_blank">management tools on offer</a> for Windows users. Docker Desktop is a bloated mess, and most of the dashboards I've used to make sense of     <span><a href="/best-tools-for-monitoring-your-home-lab/" target="_blank">what's going on in my home lab</a></span> have more features than I want to learn. I don't need more than the Docker engine running, so I can <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-chose-docker-compose/" target="_blank">use Docker Compose in my Terminal</a>, and a way to see which containers I have on the go.    </p>    <p>And that's it. I don't need to be able to pull images from a central hub, or to edit files because I can do that nicely in VS Code. I don't want to reinvent the wheel every time I want to type <strong>docker compose up -d</strong> on the command line, or have to search for where the compose files are saved, or any of the annoyances that make me wish that I hadn't tried running Docker on Windows again. The good thing about containers is that there are a hundred ways to do any task, and I've found a dashboard that shows me what's running, which ports they're using, and links to the image being used, and that's all I need.</p>    <h2>

      <![CDATA[<p>Fancy some platforming fun? N++ has been around for a while (I remember when it was just a browser game), and it's now celebrating its tenth anniversary on Steam with its TEN++ update. Fortunately, to celebrate the occasion, the game has gone on a pretty steep discount. So, if you're itching to play something but you're not feeling like shelling out the big bucks, you can score N++ on Steam for the low price of $3.74.</p>    <h2>
N++ falls to $3.74 to celebrate its tenth anniversary
</h2>
<p>At its core, N++ is a precision platformer. It has the same vibes as games like Super Meat Boy, where making careful jumps is key and one mistake can ruin it all. Your goal is to collect all of the gold on each level while dodging pitfalls, traps, and even weapons shooting at you, and one slip-up has you starting from the beginning. It has some lovely momentum gameplay that lets you convert fall speed into horizontal movement if you hit a slope just right, and it feels great.</p>    <p>Here's how the devs describe the game:</p>    <blockquote>
<p> N++ is a fast-paced, momentum-based platformer about darting around obstacles, narrowly evading enemies and collecting gold in a beautiful minimalist landscape. It’s the first N game on PC since 2004 and we’ve spent those 12 years perfecting the platformer.</p>
<p>N++ is all about using your momentum to complete levels and get high scores, but in this sci-fi world, there’s a slew of inadvertently homicidal enemy robots trying to prevent you from completing your goal.</p>
<p>Through the hand-crafted (NOT procedurally generated) levels, you’ll experience platforming at its most intense. Using only your fluid movement, you need to ‘solve’ each level and get to the exit.</p>
</blockquote><p>If that tickles your fancy, you can grab N++ for just $3.74 on Steam right now as part of its tenth anniversary celebrations. However, the party won't last forever; you've got until October 23rd to snap it up before it goes back to being full price.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Fancy some platforming fun? N++ has been around for a while (I remember when it was just a browser game), and it's now celebrating its tenth anniversary on Steam with its TEN++ update. Fortunately, to celebrate the occasion, the game has gone on a pretty steep discount. So, if you're itching to play something but you're not feeling like shelling out the big bucks, you can score N++ on Steam for the low price of $3.74.</p>    <h2>
N++ falls to $3.74 to celebrate its tenth anniversary
</h2>
<p>At its core, N++ is a precision platformer. It has the same vibes as games like Super Meat Boy, where making careful jumps is key and one mistake can ruin it all. Your goal is to collect all of the gold on each level while dodging pitfalls, traps, and even weapons shooting at you, and one slip-up has you starting from the beginning. It has some lovely momentum gameplay that lets you convert fall speed into horizontal movement if you hit a slope just right, and it feels great.</p>    <p>Here's how the devs describe the game:</p>    <blockquote>
<p> N++ is a fast-paced, momentum-based platformer about darting around obstacles, narrowly evading enemies and collecting gold in a beautiful minimalist landscape. It’s the first N game on PC since 2004 and we’ve spent those 12 years perfecting the platformer.</p>
<p>N++ is all about using your momentum to complete levels and get high scores, but in this sci-fi world, there’s a slew of inadvertently homicidal enemy robots trying to prevent you from completing your goal.</p>
<p>Through the hand-crafted (NOT procedurally generated) levels, you’ll experience platforming at its most intense. Using only your fluid movement, you need to ‘solve’ each level and get to the exit.</p>
</blockquote><p>If that tickles your fancy, you can grab N++ for just $3.74 on Steam right now as part of its tenth anniversary celebrations. However, the party won't last forever; you've got until October 23rd to snap it up before it goes back to being full price.</p>
