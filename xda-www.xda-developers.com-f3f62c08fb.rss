      <![CDATA[<p>Fancy some platforming fun? N++ has been around for a while (I remember when it was just a browser game), and it's now celebrating its tenth anniversary on Steam with its TEN++ update. Fortunately, to celebrate the occasion, the game has gone on a pretty steep discount. So, if you're itching to play something but you're not feeling like shelling out the big bucks, you can score N++ on Steam for the low price of $3.74.</p>    <h2>
N++ falls to $3.74 to celebrate its tenth anniversary
</h2>
<p>At its core, N++ is a precision platformer. It has the same vibes as games like Super Meat Boy, where making careful jumps is key and one mistake can ruin it all. Your goal is to collect all of the gold on each level while dodging pitfalls, traps, and even weapons shooting at you, and one slip-up has you starting from the beginning. It has some lovely momentum gameplay that lets you convert fall speed into horizontal movement if you hit a slope just right, and it feels great.</p>    <p>Here's how the devs describe the game:</p>    <blockquote>
<p> N++ is a fast-paced, momentum-based platformer about darting around obstacles, narrowly evading enemies and collecting gold in a beautiful minimalist landscape. It’s the first N game on PC since 2004 and we’ve spent those 12 years perfecting the platformer.</p>
<p>N++ is all about using your momentum to complete levels and get high scores, but in this sci-fi world, there’s a slew of inadvertently homicidal enemy robots trying to prevent you from completing your goal.</p>
<p>Through the hand-crafted (NOT procedurally generated) levels, you’ll experience platforming at its most intense. Using only your fluid movement, you need to ‘solve’ each level and get to the exit.</p>
</blockquote><p>If that tickles your fancy, you can grab N++ for just $3.74 on Steam right now as part of its tenth anniversary celebrations. However, the party won't last forever; you've got until October 23rd to snap it up before it goes back to being full price.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fancy some platforming fun? N++ has been around for a while (I remember when it was just a browser game), and it's now celebrating its tenth anniversary on Steam with its TEN++ update. Fortunately, to celebrate the occasion, the game has gone on a pretty steep discount. So, if you're itching to play something but you're not feeling like shelling out the big bucks, you can score N++ on Steam for the low price of $3.74.</p>    <h2>
N++ falls to $3.74 to celebrate its tenth anniversary
</h2>
<p>At its core, N++ is a precision platformer. It has the same vibes as games like Super Meat Boy, where making careful jumps is key and one mistake can ruin it all. Your goal is to collect all of the gold on each level while dodging pitfalls, traps, and even weapons shooting at you, and one slip-up has you starting from the beginning. It has some lovely momentum gameplay that lets you convert fall speed into horizontal movement if you hit a slope just right, and it feels great.</p>    <p>Here's how the devs describe the game:</p>    <blockquote>
<p> N++ is a fast-paced, momentum-based platformer about darting around obstacles, narrowly evading enemies and collecting gold in a beautiful minimalist landscape. It’s the first N game on PC since 2004 and we’ve spent those 12 years perfecting the platformer.</p>
<p>N++ is all about using your momentum to complete levels and get high scores, but in this sci-fi world, there’s a slew of inadvertently homicidal enemy robots trying to prevent you from completing your goal.</p>
<p>Through the hand-crafted (NOT procedurally generated) levels, you’ll experience platforming at its most intense. Using only your fluid movement, you need to ‘solve’ each level and get to the exit.</p>
</blockquote><p>If that tickles your fancy, you can grab N++ for just $3.74 on Steam right now as part of its tenth anniversary celebrations. However, the party won't last forever; you've got until October 23rd to snap it up before it goes back to being full price.</p>

<li>
Ayaneo Pocket Air Mini: 4.2" handheld for PS2/GameCube-era emulation with Hall-effect sticks and rotor vibration.
</li>
<li>
Retail price $94, Indiegogo pledge drops it to $73; add-ons like bag and screen film are also discounted.

</section><p>If I had a nickel for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/apple-iphone-air-reveal/" target="_blank">every time I've reported on a pocket device with "Air" in the name</a> in the last few months, I'd have two nickels. Fortunately, they're two very different devices, so if you're not interested in Apple's new offerings, perhaps the Ayaneo Pocket Air Mini is more suitable. It's a little handheld that specialises in running retro games, and despite its recommended retail price being pretty reasonable by itself, you can score an additional $20 off if you help back its crowdfunding campaign.</p>    <h2>
The Ayaneo Pocket Air Mini is a very affordable handheld for retro gamers
</h2>
<p>If you've never heard the name "Ayaneo" before, then let me get you two introduced. The company specialises in creating hardware that lets people play retro games on newer hardware. They've got an excellent track record, which is why I'm reporting on its latest crowdfunding campaign for its newest product, the Ayaneo Pocket Air Mini.</p>    <p>So, what is this little guy? Well, it's a handheld console that supports games up to the PS2 and GameCube era. It has a 4.2-inch screen size and kind of looks like a teeny-tiny Steam Deck, albeit more focused on playing the old over the new. Still, just because it's small doesn't mean it skimps on the details; we're looking at Hall effect joysticks and triggers, plus a rotor motor vibration feature built into the console. Very nice.</p>    <p>The bit that really wows me, however, is its price. Ayaneo will retail this delightful console for just $94, which honestly feels like a steal given what you get for the price. However, it gets better; you can grab it for $73 instead if you head over to the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/en/projects/ayaneo/pocket-air-mini-first-4-3-retro-screen-handheld/#/section/project-story" target="_blank">project's Indiegogo page</a> and make a pledge. You can also score money off a carry bag and a protective film if you add them as add-ons.</p>    <p>As much as I really like Ayaneo's stuff, I do have to warn you that <strong>pledging is not the same as buying!</strong> There's never a guarantee that a product will actually ship, let alone look and feel like what the original pitch promised. As such, <strong>never pledge money you're not comfortable with potentially losing</strong>. If that's still alright with you, you'll be pleased to hear that the Indiegogo campaign has already been fully funded, so you won't have to worry about the project taking off.</p>    <p><span>If you want to see what else the company has made, check out our shining review of the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ayaneo-3-review/" target="_blank">Ayaneo 3,</a> where we praise its ergonomic design and beautiful screen.</span></p>]]>

Windows 11's dark mode still misses legacy dialogs like file transfer.

</section><p>Have you noticed that Windows 11's dark mode isn't <em>completely</em> dark? Sure, it manages to catch most of the newer UI elements of the operating system, but the older elements that have been passed down from Windows generation to generation remain unaffected. This means you'll get the occasional flashbang every time you move files from one place to another, as the file transfer dialog box is not yet included in dark mode.</p>    <p>However, Microsoft is doing its best to change that. The company has been adding new dark mode additions to the older Windows UI, and if I'm being honest, they're looking very stylish indeed.</p>    <h2>
Microsoft finally adds dark mode where it needs to go
</h2><p>This change was spotted by PhantomOfEarth on X, who's always one to keep tabs on every time Windows updates. Phantom has a knack for digging through the newest update on the Insider branches and finding unannounced changes that aren't ready for testing yet.</p>    <p>For the latest Windows Insider build, they spotted the new folder option and Run dialog dark mode schemes, as well as Vivetool commands for enabling them:</p>
<p>Looks snazzy, right? Given how these themes need to be unlocked manually via Vivetool, it's likely that Microsoft is still ironing out any issues with this new dark mode. However, from what I'm seeing, it's shaping up to be a welcome addition for people who want a true dark mode on Windows 11.</p>    <p>Unfortunately, because it's still hidden away on the Insider branches, we'll likely not see this on the Release channel for quite some time. Microsoft first has to decide that it's worth showing off to the public, which usually involves activating the features for all testers to see without manual intervention. Once that's done, the update needs to pass through the standard checks and tests, making its way through the testing channels until its penultimate destination, the Release Preview channel. And if it passes <em>that</em>, then we'll see it on our PCs. Until then, try not to do any big file transfers in the wee hours of the morning.</p>    <p>If you want more control over when dark mode turns on and off, there's a tool for that, albeit it's not preinstalled on Windows.

      <![CDATA[<p>With their lightweight nature and solid isolation provisions, containers are quite useful in home labs when you need to self-host applications without the extra performance overhead of virtual machines. As such, you’ll find plenty of tools designed to enhance your containerization tasks, and these range from barebones container runtimes to powerful orchestration platforms. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/kubernetes-old-pc-guide/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> is one of the most popular container orchestration platforms out there, though its enterprise-grade utilities make it rather overkill for the average home lab.</p>    <p>In contrast, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/docker-swarm-guide/" target="_blank">Docker Swarm</a> is often regarded as the inferior orchestration tool, as it’s not only restricted to Docker products, but also doesn’t feature auto-scaling provisions. But as someone who has tinkered extensively with K8s and Swarm, I have to admit that Docker’s orchestration platform is a lot more useful for normal home labs.</p>    <h2>
Setting up Docker Swarm is a cakewalk
</h2><h3>
And it’s just as simple to use
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-651130571" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-651130571" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-651130571" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-651130571" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-651130571-img" data-gallery-type="">

<p>Docker Swarm’s strength lies in its accessible nature, and its setup process is extremely simple even for beginners. If you’ve already installed Docker, you can turn any machine into the Docker Swarm manager node by running the<em> docker swarm init --advertise-addr IP_address_of_host </em>command. Likewise, adding new nodes to the newly-deployed cluster is as simple as executing <em>docker swarm join</em> followed by the<em> join code</em> (from the previous command) on the secondary machines. If you go down the CLI route, Swarm’s commands aren’t all that different from the ones you’ll run on a typical Docker setup.</p>    <p>In contrast, a Kubernetes cluster requires a lot more elbow grease. First, you’ll have to choose between different K8s runtimes. Even the simpler ones like MicroK8s require a lot of extra packages and terminal commands, with Arm devices like the Raspberry Pi units requiring additional kernel tweaks to deploy the Kubernetes runtime. Likewise, Kubernetes is a lot more challenging to use than Docker Swarm as you’ll have to deal with complex network policies, pod deployments, and role bindings, especially if you plan to use a command-line interface to manage your K8s cluster. And that’s before you consider the lack of support for Docker Compose files on Kubernetes…</p>    <h2>
You can use Docker Compose configs in Swarm
</h2><h3>
They’re a lot more accessible than K8s pod files

</div>
</div>
<p>When you start self-hosting services en-masse, you’ll end up loving Docker Compose files as much as I do. Rather than writing long commands, Docker Compose files let you configure every aspect of your containers using YAML code. Since most containerized services tend to include docker-compose.yml files in their project repositories, Compose lets you get the service up and running in less time than you’d take to finish reading this sentence. </p>    <p>Technically, Kubernetes has a similar concept in the form of pod and object files, so you do get the ability to deploy containers from YAML configurations. Unfortunately, the typical docker-compose.yml files aren’t compatible with Kubernetes, so you can’t simply paste the Docker Compose YAML code from project repos when you want to deploy new services. That said, many popular services are available on Helm charts, which makes deploying them slightly easier. There’s also the Kompose utility, which can translate Docker Compose YAML configs into the equivalent K8s code, though I’ve had mixed results when using it on my MicroK8s cluster.</p>    <h2>

<p>Although terminal commands are the most recommended method for controlling container-heavy clusters, nothing beats the convenience of a menu-based web interface. If you rely on MicroK8s to manage your Kubernetes cluster, you may be aware that it lets you enable a web UI. Having used this interface to manage pods, create policies, and define volumes since I deployed K8s ages ago, I consider Kubernetes’ web UI a key advantage over its Swarm rival.</p>    <p>Well, you could set up Swarmpit to manage your Swarm cluster, but doing so requires some extra tweaks, including running a Traefik HTTPS Proxy. Fortunately, the all-powerful <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/portainer-guide/" target="_blank">Portainer</a> evens the odds, and it’s a lot easier to use than the Kubernetes Dashboard. Deploying Portainer on the manager node is just as simple, and this neat web UI can even detect cluster nodes without requiring additional config tweaks.

<p>Although Docker Swarm is my go-to platform for containers that require high-availability support, its lack of compatibility for non-Docker products is my biggest gripe with the platform.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With their lightweight nature and solid isolation provisions, containers are quite useful in home labs when you need to self-host applications without the extra performance overhead of virtual machines. As such, you’ll find plenty of tools designed to enhance your containerization tasks, and these range from barebones container runtimes to powerful orchestration platforms. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/kubernetes-old-pc-guide/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> is one of the most popular container orchestration platforms out there, though its enterprise-grade utilities make it rather overkill for the average home lab.</p>    <p>In contrast, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/docker-swarm-guide/" target="_blank">Docker Swarm</a> is often regarded as the inferior orchestration tool, as it’s not only restricted to Docker products, but also doesn’t feature auto-scaling provisions. But as someone who has tinkered extensively with K8s and Swarm, I have to admit that Docker’s orchestration platform is a lot more useful for normal home labs.</p>    <h2>
Setting up Docker Swarm is a cakewalk
</h2><h3>
And it’s just as simple to use
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-651130571" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-651130571" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-651130571" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-651130571" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-651130571-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Docker Swarm’s strength lies in its accessible nature, and its setup process is extremely simple even for beginners. If you’ve already installed Docker, you can turn any machine into the Docker Swarm manager node by running the<em> docker swarm init --advertise-addr IP_address_of_host </em>command. Likewise, adding new nodes to the newly-deployed cluster is as simple as executing <em>docker swarm join</em> followed by the<em> join code</em> (from the previous command) on the secondary machines. If you go down the CLI route, Swarm’s commands aren’t all that different from the ones you’ll run on a typical Docker setup.</p>    <p>In contrast, a Kubernetes cluster requires a lot more elbow grease. First, you’ll have to choose between different K8s runtimes. Even the simpler ones like MicroK8s require a lot of extra packages and terminal commands, with Arm devices like the Raspberry Pi units requiring additional kernel tweaks to deploy the Kubernetes runtime. Likewise, Kubernetes is a lot more challenging to use than Docker Swarm as you’ll have to deal with complex network policies, pod deployments, and role bindings, especially if you plan to use a command-line interface to manage your K8s cluster. And that’s before you consider the lack of support for Docker Compose files on Kubernetes…</p>    <h2>
You can use Docker Compose configs in Swarm
</h2><h3>
They’re a lot more accessible than K8s pod files
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Running the docker compose command to create a Docker container for RomM" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/docker-compose.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>When you start self-hosting services en-masse, you’ll end up loving Docker Compose files as much as I do. Rather than writing long commands, Docker Compose files let you configure every aspect of your containers using YAML code. Since most containerized services tend to include docker-compose.yml files in their project repositories, Compose lets you get the service up and running in less time than you’d take to finish reading this sentence. </p>    <p>Technically, Kubernetes has a similar concept in the form of pod and object files, so you do get the ability to deploy containers from YAML configurations. Unfortunately, the typical docker-compose.yml files aren’t compatible with Kubernetes, so you can’t simply paste the Docker Compose YAML code from project repos when you want to deploy new services. That said, many popular services are available on Helm charts, which makes deploying them slightly easier. There’s also the Kompose utility, which can translate Docker Compose YAML configs into the equivalent K8s code, though I’ve had mixed results when using it on my MicroK8s cluster.</p>    <h2>
Portainer pairs well with Docker Swarm
</h2><h3>
So, you’re covered on the web UI front as well
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-595148968" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-595148968" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-595148968" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-595148968" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-595148968-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Although terminal commands are the most recommended method for controlling container-heavy clusters, nothing beats the convenience of a menu-based web interface. If you rely on MicroK8s to manage your Kubernetes cluster, you may be aware that it lets you enable a web UI. Having used this interface to manage pods, create policies, and define volumes since I deployed K8s ages ago, I consider Kubernetes’ web UI a key advantage over its Swarm rival.</p>    <p>Well, you could set up Swarmpit to manage your Swarm cluster, but doing so requires some extra tweaks, including running a Traefik HTTPS Proxy. Fortunately, the all-powerful <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/portainer-guide/" target="_blank">Portainer</a> evens the odds, and it’s a lot easier to use than the Kubernetes Dashboard. Deploying Portainer on the manager node is just as simple, and this neat web UI can even detect cluster nodes without requiring additional config tweaks. Plus, since Portainer lets you configure everything from network settings and storage volumes to container images and Swarm stacks, it’s a convenient alternative to the already simplified Docker Swarm CLI commands. </p>    <h3>
Nevertheless, Kubernetes offers solid benefits for hardcore setups
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-776095540" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-776095540" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-776095540" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-776095540" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-776095540-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Although Docker Swarm is my go-to platform for containers that require high-availability support, its lack of compatibility for non-Docker products is my biggest gripe with the platform. I started migrating my container workloads to Podman earlier this year, and while it’s a bit more difficult to use, it serves my DevOps and sysadmin experiments fairly well. </p>    <p>For most home labbers, Docker Swarm will be more than enough if you want the superior fault tolerance of a cluster environment. But if you’ve built a home lab to train your DevOps skills like I did, you’ll want to go for Kubernetes instead – not just because it’s compatible with Podman and other container platforms, but also because it meshes well with automation utilities and other community tools.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>These days, when someone builds a new PC, the norm is to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-to-consider-upgrading-to-larger-ssd/" target="_blank">get a single large SSD</a> to handle all of their storage needs — OS, games, documents, media collection, backups, and more. SSD prices aren't prohibitive anymore, so it makes sense to just buy a single fast drive and call it a day. However, I'd like to propose four alternatives to this layout. Even if you don't care about saving money, you might be interested in improving drive longevity, performance, and efficiency. Each of these options needs to be considered <strong>in addition to your primary SSD</strong>, which doesn't have to be larger than a 1TB or 2TB drive.</p>    <h2>
A dedicated SSD for your game library
</h2><h3>
Improving performance and longevity
</h3>

<p>The simplest alternative to a single big SSD is to get a second <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-have-dedicated-ssd-for-games/" target="_blank">SSD dedicated to your game library</a>. While storing all your games on the same drive as your OS is just fine, offloading them to a separate SSD has a few benefits. Firstly, by distributing the load across two SSDs, you're effectively increasing the lifespan for both of them. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ssd-wear-might-be-the-most-overhyped-hardware-problem/" target="_blank">SSD wear might feel overhyped</a> sometimes, but making your drives last longer is always a plus. Secondly, your OS drive is likely to perform better if it stays unencumbered by tons of game files — SSDs get slower as they fill up.</p>    <p>Lastly, this kind of organization adds some redundancy to your system. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-lost-everything-to-a-bad-ssd/" target="_blank">SSDs aren't immune to data corruption</a>, and separating your data improves your chances of protecting it in case one of the SSDs fails. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-quickly-set-up-the-3-2-1-backup-rule/" target="_blank">Backing up your data</a> is the only foolproof way of protecting it, but using a separate SSD for everything other than your OS and critical software gets you closer to the goal. </p>

<p>Your user folders, like "Downloads" and "Documents," are often home to countless files that you never bother sorting through. They keep occupying precious space on your main SSD, which could have been used for better purposes. Most of the time, people don't even need the dozens of GBs of old downloads hogging disk space in their Downloads folder. If you think you'll need those files someday, it's better to change the location of these folders to a secondary drive.</p>    <p>All you need to do is right-click the respective folder, select "Properties", go to the "Location" tab, and select a new location on a separate drive. Windows will start using the new location for that specific folder without breaking any dependencies. Doing this will not only free up precious space on your main SSD, but also make you more mindful of all the old junk you need to get rid of from your Downloads or Documents folder.</p>    <h2>

<p>A common storage layout is adding a relatively cheap but <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/stocking-up-on-hdds-not-ssds/" target="_blank">spacious hard drive</a> to your PC in addition to your primary SSD. It might not come close to your NVMe SSD in terms of performance, but not every kind of data on your PC needs blazing-fast speeds. Besides your OS files, games, and a handful of other programs, you can realistically offload everything else to, say, a 4TB HDD. This can include your old photos and videos collection, movies and music, backups, OS images, and other non-essential data that you access occasionally. </p>    <p>A 4TB hard drive can be yours for just $75 on most days, far cheaper than a 4TB or even a 2TB NVMe SSD. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-i-never-trust-ssd-for-long-term-storage/" target="_blank">Hard drives are excellent for long-term storage</a>, offering a reliable way to park your non-critical data while you use your fast NVMe drive for daily use. Just like other storage layouts on this list, this will help you fully utilize your pricier SSD.

<h3>
A single big SSD is a simple, but not always the best choice
</h3>
<p>You might be tempted to use a single spacious SSD on your next PC, but consider alternate storage layouts for more performance and drive longevity. Using a dedicated game drive, a secondary HDD, or a NAS in addition to your primary SSD can not only optimize your premium SSD space, but also introduce some redundancy and better serve different kinds of data. </p>]]>

    <description>
      <![CDATA[<p>These days, when someone builds a new PC, the norm is to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-to-consider-upgrading-to-larger-ssd/" target="_blank">get a single large SSD</a> to handle all of their storage needs — OS, games, documents, media collection, backups, and more. SSD prices aren't prohibitive anymore, so it makes sense to just buy a single fast drive and call it a day. However, I'd like to propose four alternatives to this layout. Even if you don't care about saving money, you might be interested in improving drive longevity, performance, and efficiency. Each of these options needs to be considered <strong>in addition to your primary SSD</strong>, which doesn't have to be larger than a 1TB or 2TB drive.</p>    <h2>
A dedicated SSD for your game library
</h2><h3>
Improving performance and longevity
</h3>

<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1292824254" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1292824254" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1292824254" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1292824254" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1292824254-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The simplest alternative to a single big SSD is to get a second <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-have-dedicated-ssd-for-games/" target="_blank">SSD dedicated to your game library</a>. While storing all your games on the same drive as your OS is just fine, offloading them to a separate SSD has a few benefits. Firstly, by distributing the load across two SSDs, you're effectively increasing the lifespan for both of them. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ssd-wear-might-be-the-most-overhyped-hardware-problem/" target="_blank">SSD wear might feel overhyped</a> sometimes, but making your drives last longer is always a plus. Secondly, your OS drive is likely to perform better if it stays unencumbered by tons of game files — SSDs get slower as they fill up.</p>    <p>Lastly, this kind of organization adds some redundancy to your system. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-lost-everything-to-a-bad-ssd/" target="_blank">SSDs aren't immune to data corruption</a>, and separating your data improves your chances of protecting it in case one of the SSDs fails. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-quickly-set-up-the-3-2-1-backup-rule/" target="_blank">Backing up your data</a> is the only foolproof way of protecting it, but using a separate SSD for everything other than your OS and critical software gets you closer to the goal. </p>

<h3>
A single big SSD is a simple, but not always the best choice
</h3>
<p>You might be tempted to use a single spacious SSD on your next PC, but consider alternate storage layouts for more performance and drive longevity. Using a dedicated game drive, a secondary HDD, or a NAS in addition to your primary SSD can not only optimize your premium SSD space, but also introduce some redundancy and better serve different kinds of data. </p>]]>
    </description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days, when someone builds a new PC, the norm is to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-to-consider-upgrading-to-larger-ssd/" target="_blank">get a single large SSD</a> to handle all of their storage needs — OS, games, documents, media collection, backups, and more. SSD prices aren't prohibitive anymore, so it makes sense to just buy a single fast drive and call it a day. However, I'd like to propose four alternatives to this layout. Even if you don't care about saving money, you might be interested in improving drive longevity, performance, and efficiency. Each of these options needs to be considered <strong>in addition to your primary SSD</strong>, which doesn't have to be larger than a 1TB or 2TB drive.</p>    <h2>
A dedicated SSD for your game library
</h2><h3>
Improving performance and longevity

</div>
<p>The simplest alternative to a single big SSD is to get a second <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-have-dedicated-ssd-for-games/" target="_blank">SSD dedicated to your game library</a>. While storing all your games on the same drive as your OS is just fine, offloading them to a separate SSD has a few benefits. Firstly, by distributing the load across two SSDs, you're effectively increasing the lifespan for both of them. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ssd-wear-might-be-the-most-overhyped-hardware-problem/" target="_blank">SSD wear might feel overhyped</a> sometimes, but making your drives last longer is always a plus. Secondly, your OS drive is likely to perform better if it stays unencumbered by tons of game files — SSDs get slower as they fill up.</p>    <p>Lastly, this kind of organization adds some redundancy to your system. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-lost-everything-to-a-bad-ssd/" target="_blank">SSDs aren't immune to data corruption</a>, and separating your data improves your chances of protecting it in case one of the SSDs fails. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-quickly-set-up-the-3-2-1-backup-rule/" target="_blank">Backing up your data</a> is the only foolproof way of protecting it, but using a separate SSD for everything other than your OS and critical software gets you closer to the goal. </p>

<p>Your user folders, like "Downloads" and "Documents," are often home to countless files that you never bother sorting through. They keep occupying precious space on your main SSD, which could have been used for better purposes. Most of the time, people don't even need the dozens of GBs of old downloads hogging disk space in their Downloads folder. If you think you'll need those files someday, it's better to change the location of these folders to a secondary drive.</p>    <p>All you need to do is right-click the respective folder, select "Properties", go to the "Location" tab, and select a new location on a separate drive. Windows will start using the new location for that specific folder without breaking any dependencies. Doing this will not only free up precious space on your main SSD, but also make you more mindful of all the old junk you need to get rid of from your Downloads or Documents folder.</p>    <h2>

<p>A common storage layout is adding a relatively cheap but <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/stocking-up-on-hdds-not-ssds/" target="_blank">spacious hard drive</a> to your PC in addition to your primary SSD. It might not come close to your NVMe SSD in terms of performance, but not every kind of data on your PC needs blazing-fast speeds. Besides your OS files, games, and a handful of other programs, you can realistically offload everything else to, say, a 4TB HDD. This can include your old photos and videos collection, movies and music, backups, OS images, and other non-essential data that you access occasionally. </p>    <p>A 4TB hard drive can be yours for just $75 on most days, far cheaper than a 4TB or even a 2TB NVMe SSD. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-i-never-trust-ssd-for-long-term-storage/" target="_blank">Hard drives are excellent for long-term storage</a>, offering a reliable way to park your non-critical data while you use your fast NVMe drive for daily use. Just like other storage layouts on this list, this will help you fully utilize your pricier SSD. What it'll also do is allow you to buy a 1TB or 2TB SSD instead of a larger drive that will cost prohibitively more.</p>

<p>A great addition to your primary SSD is a NAS to manage all your backups, streaming media, and archival data. None of this stuff needs to reside on your fast NVMe SSD, hogging premium storage space. An SSD-only PC with all your OS files, games, and software complemented by an affordable all-HDD NAS is a perfect setup to benefit from the best of both worlds. Transferring your Plex library, automated backups, and photo collection to your NAS will free up tons of space on your PC, and will be better managed on an always-on, power-efficient NAS.</p>    <p>You can even <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-turn-old-pc-into-nas/" target="_blank">build your own NAS</a> instead of buying one. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/10-things-to-use-your-old-desktop-pc-for/" target="_blank">Repurposing an old PC</a>, buying some NAS drives, and setting up a <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/best-nas-operating-systems/" target="_blank">NAS operating system</a> and file system are pretty much all you need to do. Meanwhile, your SSD on your PC will be free from the write-heavy backups and photo syncing that can hit its lifespan hard. Instead of a massive SSD storing everything, separating different data types on your SSD and NAS is the smarter way to do it.</p>

Still, what's the point of a good horror game if you can't enjoy it with your friends? After all, the most dire of situations also become insanely hilarious if you've got some friends along, and there's just nothing more rewarding than exploring a haunted setting and hearing your friend scream out from the other end of the hall.</p>    <p>We had some immensely rewarding <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/upcoming-horror-games-in-september-2025/" target="_blank">single-player horror releases</a> this year, but it's honestly the smaller, co-op centric survival-horror experiences where the 'fun' truly lies.

That's gold right there, and <em>Project Unknown </em>delivers exactly that. As members of Paranormal Property Solutions, you and your squad will go to clients' houses that are being haunted by supernatural creatures with terrifying design.</p>    <p>The job? Learn the ghosts' patterns, behaviors, and where they are coming from to exorcise them. Each character you pick will have unique special abilities that will help the squad when picked right, and with the right tools at your disposal, you'll be able to exorcise the spirits that haunt the properties in <em>Project Unknown</em>. The game is even on sale until October 24, meaning you could just as easily pick two copies — one for yourself and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/7-cheap-steam-games-you-can-gift-to-your-friends-as-a-joke/" target="_blank">one for a friend</a> to try out.</p>

R.E.P.O. ($10)

Clientele that does not want their belongings repossessed

<p>Imagine if <em>Phasmophobia </em>had more edge, and what you get from that is <em>R.E.P.O.</em> In this game, you and your squad play as paranormal repossession agents. As ridiculous as it sounds, it's just as much fun. You're tasked with clearing out haunted locations of restless spirits. However, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/games-trying-to-be-funny-that-are-actually-funny/" target="_blank">instead of comedy-driven chaos</a> (which you'll still get plenty of), <em>R.E.P.O.</em> leans into genuine fear with its dark visuals and unpredictable hauntings.</p>    <p>Each encounter in the game feels handcrafted to ruin your nerves. The best part? Every single member of the squad has a job to do, which makes teamwork non-negotiable. You're going to find yourself yelling, panicking, and even blaming your own friends for dying... right before instantly queuing up for another round.</p>

<h2>
Panicore ($5)

One monster, five victims, and unlimited screaming

<p>Sometimes, all you need is a good old-fashioned "run or die" formula to remind you just how anxiety-inducing things can get in a horror game, and <em>Panicore </em>is a brilliant example of that. In this game, you and your friends are stuck in a dark facility, hunted by an unpredictable monster as you navigate tight corridors and dark paths to find a way out, debating if splitting up to find the right path would be better than sticking together.</p>    <p>Sounds simple enough, right? Except that the game <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/chrome-extension-scream-im-a-loser/" target="_blank">requires your mic to be on</a> at all times, because the unpredictable monster reacts to sound as well. This means that even a small shriek or even a sentence spoken out too loud could get you killed. Sneaking quietly then becomes incredibly important, and any information you share over comms is limited, delivered under the fear of the monster hearing you. The atmosphere is thick, the lighting is perfect, and the sense of helplessness is constant in <em>Panicore</em>.</p>

<p>Inarguably my favorite survival-horror co-op game, <em>The Outlast Trials</em> takes all the fear, anxiety, and vulnerability from the fantastic <em>Outlast </em>games and puts it into a well-crafted and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-reasons-for-the-return-of-local-couch-co-op/" target="_blank">deep co-op experience</a> that you and your friends won't ever get tired of. The single-player games were all about running away from all sorts of monsters and creatures, but <em>The Outlast Trials </em>gives you some options to tool up with your friends, investing in soft abilities that will definitely help you, but don't fool yourself into thinking you could take on the variety of horrors the game will throw at you.</p>    <p>You and your friends can go through an extensive number of trials, both quick and long, inside a Cold War-era testing facility, enduring gruesome "experiments" that push every limit of fear, endurance, and your sanity. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-co-op-horror-multiplayer-games-that-are-scary-and-funny/" target="_blank">Co-operation isn't a choice here</a>. You will have to heal each other, revive fallen teammates, or try to survive in pitch-black rooms while being hunted by some incredibly unsettling antagonists while you hunt for keys, solve puzzles to make progress, and go from one objective to the next.</p>    <p><em>The Outlast Trials </em>is grim, graphic, and genuinely unsettling, and yet, the shared suffering somehow makes it all fun. There's plenty of gore, violence, and bloodshed in the game, and it's also a great example of how heavily <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-art-styles-games/" target="_blank">visual design</a> can affect your playthrough. An absolute must-play, will undoubtedly leave you and your squad wanting more. It even has cross-play functionality, meaning you can play it with your friends who have it on Xbox or PlayStation.</p>

<p>Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?<br>
<br>
Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society. In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.<br>
Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete. Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.</p>

Demonologist ($20)
</h2><h3>
Phasmophobia's evil cousin, realized in Unreal Engine 5
</h3>

<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-6-1314320404" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-6-1314320404" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-6-1314320404" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-6-1314320404" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-6-1314320404-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Think of <em>Demonologist </em>as <em>Phasmophobia</em>'s evil cousin. The game wears its Phasmophobia inspiration proudly, but also adds a level of production quality that makes it stand out. The sound design alone is a masterpiece in the game. Creaks, whispers, and sudden bangs, all get under your skin constantly, all mixed to make you doubt your own sanity. Each map feels alive, filled with little details that pull you in, with each map packed with terrifying jump scares and ghosts.</p>    <p>The gameplay loop here is rather reminiscent of <em>Phasmophobia</em>, where you identify the type of demon that is haunting the place before setting up traps for it and gathering evidence. The best part, however, is the game being built on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tired-of-broken-pc-ports-heres-how-unreal-engine-is-fixing-the-problem/" target="_blank">Unreal Engine 5</a>, which genuinely makes it look incredibly realistic and horrifying. <em>Demonologist </em>is remarkably intense and atmospheric, but also a blast with friends, because there's nothing funnier than watching your friend get jump-scared mid-sentence.</p>

Horror doesn't have to be a lonely experience

</div>
</section><p>Horror games are great for those who love fear in their video games, but only co-op horror brings with it a special kind of chaos. It's a sweet blend of fear and laughter, mixed in with frustration and triumph. Horror doesn't have to be a lonely experience at all, and when you face your fears with your friends, there's just nothing quite like it.</p>    <p>So this Halloween, grab your headsets, rally your friends, and prepare to scream, laugh, and maybe even stifle some of those shrieks, lest the ghost hear you, because Spooktober is always better when you suffer together.</p>]]>

    <description>
      <![CDATA[<p>It's Spooktober again, and with Halloween just a couple of weeks out, now is the best time to get your horror game library growing again. Still, what's the point of a good horror game if you can't enjoy it with your friends? After all, the most dire of situations also become insanely hilarious if you've got some friends along, and there's just nothing more rewarding than exploring a haunted setting and hearing your friend scream out from the other end of the hall.</p>    <p>We had some immensely rewarding <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/upcoming-horror-games-in-september-2025/" target="_blank">single-player horror releases</a> this year, but it's honestly the smaller, co-op centric survival-horror experiences where the 'fun' truly lies. That becomes even truer when everyone is on voice chat and trying not to scream their heads off.</p>    <h2>

<p>We've all played <em>Phasmophobia</em>, and frankly, we've heard way too much about it, too. Still, the concept of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/horror-games-my-teenage-self-was-too-scared-to-finish/" target="_blank">pure survival-horror</a> with friends that is <em>genuinely</em> scary even when you're with friends? That's gold right there, and <em>Project Unknown </em>delivers exactly that. As members of Paranormal Property Solutions, you and your squad will go to clients' houses that are being haunted by supernatural creatures with terrifying design.</p>    <p>The job? Learn the ghosts' patterns, behaviors, and where they are coming from to exorcise them. Each character you pick will have unique special abilities that will help the squad when picked right, and with the right tools at your disposal, you'll be able to exorcise the spirits that haunt the properties in <em>Project Unknown</em>. The game is even on sale until October 24, meaning you could just as easily pick two copies — one for yourself and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/7-cheap-steam-games-you-can-gift-to-your-friends-as-a-joke/" target="_blank">one for a friend</a> to try out.</p>

<p>Imagine if <em>Phasmophobia </em>had more edge, and what you get from that is <em>R.E.P.O.</em> In this game, you and your squad play as paranormal repossession agents. As ridiculous as it sounds, it's just as much fun. You're tasked with clearing out haunted locations of restless spirits. However, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/games-trying-to-be-funny-that-are-actually-funny/" target="_blank">instead of comedy-driven chaos</a> (which you'll still get plenty of), <em>R.E.P.O.</em> leans into genuine fear with its dark visuals and unpredictable hauntings.</p>    <p>Each encounter in the game feels handcrafted to ruin your nerves. The best part? Every single member of the squad has a job to do, which makes teamwork non-negotiable. You're going to find yourself yelling, panicking, and even blaming your own friends for dying... right before instantly queuing up for another round.</p>

<p>Sometimes, all you need is a good old-fashioned "run or die" formula to remind you just how anxiety-inducing things can get in a horror game, and <em>Panicore </em>is a brilliant example of that. In this game, you and your friends are stuck in a dark facility, hunted by an unpredictable monster as you navigate tight corridors and dark paths to find a way out, debating if splitting up to find the right path would be better than sticking together.</p>    <p>Sounds simple enough, right? Except that the game <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/chrome-extension-scream-im-a-loser/" target="_blank">requires your mic to be on</a> at all times, because the unpredictable monster reacts to sound as well. This means that even a small shriek or even a sentence spoken out too loud could get you killed. Sneaking quietly then becomes incredibly important, and any information you share over comms is limited, delivered under the fear of the monster hearing you. The atmosphere is thick, the lighting is perfect, and the sense of helplessness is constant in <em>Panicore</em>.</p>

<p>Inarguably my favorite survival-horror co-op game, <em>The Outlast Trials</em> takes all the fear, anxiety, and vulnerability from the fantastic <em>Outlast </em>games and puts it into a well-crafted and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-reasons-for-the-return-of-local-couch-co-op/" target="_blank">deep co-op experience</a> that you and your friends won't ever get tired of. The single-player games were all about running away from all sorts of monsters and creatures, but <em>The Outlast Trials </em>gives you some options to tool up with your friends, investing in soft abilities that will definitely help you, but don't fool yourself into thinking you could take on the variety of horrors the game will throw at you.</p>    <p>You and your friends can go through an extensive number of trials, both quick and long, inside a Cold War-era testing facility, enduring gruesome "experiments" that push every limit of fear, endurance, and your sanity. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-co-op-horror-multiplayer-games-that-are-scary-and-funny/" target="_blank">Co-operation isn't a choice here</a>. You will have to heal each other, revive fallen teammates, or try to survive in pitch-black rooms while being hunted by some incredibly unsettling antagonists while you hunt for keys, solve puzzles to make progress, and go from one objective to the next.</p>    <p><em>The Outlast Trials </em>is grim, graphic, and genuinely unsettling, and yet, the shared suffering somehow makes it all fun. There's plenty of gore, violence, and bloodshed in the game, and it's also a great example of how heavily <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-art-styles-games/" target="_blank">visual design</a> can affect your playthrough. An absolute must-play, will undoubtedly leave you and your squad wanting more. It even has cross-play functionality, meaning you can play it with your friends who have it on Xbox or PlayStation.</p>

<p>Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?<br>
<br>
Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society. In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.<br>
Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete. Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.</p>

<h2>
Demonologist ($20)

Phasmophobia's evil cousin, realized in Unreal Engine 5
</h3>

</div>
</div>
<p>Think of <em>Demonologist </em>as <em>Phasmophobia</em>'s evil cousin. The game wears its Phasmophobia inspiration proudly, but also adds a level of production quality that makes it stand out. The sound design alone is a masterpiece in the game. Creaks, whispers, and sudden bangs, all get under your skin constantly, all mixed to make you doubt your own sanity. Each map feels alive, filled with little details that pull you in, with each map packed with terrifying jump scares and ghosts.</p>    <p>The gameplay loop here is rather reminiscent of <em>Phasmophobia</em>, where you identify the type of demon that is haunting the place before setting up traps for it and gathering evidence. The best part, however, is the game being built on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tired-of-broken-pc-ports-heres-how-unreal-engine-is-fixing-the-problem/" target="_blank">Unreal Engine 5</a>, which genuinely makes it look incredibly realistic and horrifying. <em>Demonologist </em>is remarkably intense and atmospheric, but also a blast with friends, because there's nothing funnier than watching your friend get jump-scared mid-sentence.</p>

Horror doesn't have to be a lonely experience

</div>
</section><p>Horror games are great for those who love fear in their video games, but only co-op horror brings with it a special kind of chaos. It's a sweet blend of fear and laughter, mixed in with frustration and triumph. Horror doesn't have to be a lonely experience at all, and when you face your fears with your friends, there's just nothing quite like it.</p>    <p>So this Halloween, grab your headsets, rally your friends, and prepare to scream, laugh, and maybe even stifle some of those shrieks, lest the ghost hear you, because Spooktober is always better when you suffer together.</p>]]>
    </description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's Spooktober again, and with Halloween just a couple of weeks out, now is the best time to get your horror game library growing again. Still, what's the point of a good horror game if you can't enjoy it with your friends? After all, the most dire of situations also become insanely hilarious if you've got some friends along, and there's just nothing more rewarding than exploring a haunted setting and hearing your friend scream out from the other end of the hall.</p>    <p>We had some immensely rewarding <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/upcoming-horror-games-in-september-2025/" target="_blank">single-player horror releases</a> this year, but it's honestly the smaller, co-op centric survival-horror experiences where the 'fun' truly lies. That becomes even truer when everyone is on voice chat and trying not to scream their heads off.</p>    <h2>

<p>We've all played <em>Phasmophobia</em>, and frankly, we've heard way too much about it, too. Still, the concept of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/horror-games-my-teenage-self-was-too-scared-to-finish/" target="_blank">pure survival-horror</a> with friends that is <em>genuinely</em> scary even when you're with friends? That's gold right there, and <em>Project Unknown </em>delivers exactly that. As members of Paranormal Property Solutions, you and your squad will go to clients' houses that are being haunted by supernatural creatures with terrifying design.</p>    <p>The job? Learn the ghosts' patterns, behaviors, and where they are coming from to exorcise them. Each character you pick will have unique special abilities that will help the squad when picked right, and with the right tools at your disposal, you'll be able to exorcise the spirits that haunt the properties in <em>Project Unknown</em>. The game is even on sale until October 24, meaning you could just as easily pick two copies — one for yourself and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/7-cheap-steam-games-you-can-gift-to-your-friends-as-a-joke/" target="_blank">one for a friend</a> to try out.</p>

<p>Imagine if <em>Phasmophobia </em>had more edge, and what you get from that is <em>R.E.P.O.</em> In this game, you and your squad play as paranormal repossession agents. As ridiculous as it sounds, it's just as much fun. You're tasked with clearing out haunted locations of restless spirits. However, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/games-trying-to-be-funny-that-are-actually-funny/" target="_blank">instead of comedy-driven chaos</a> (which you'll still get plenty of), <em>R.E.P.O.</em> leans into genuine fear with its dark visuals and unpredictable hauntings.</p>    <p>Each encounter in the game feels handcrafted to ruin your nerves. The best part? Every single member of the squad has a job to do, which makes teamwork non-negotiable. You're going to find yourself yelling, panicking, and even blaming your own friends for dying... right before instantly queuing up for another round.</p>

<p>Sometimes, all you need is a good old-fashioned "run or die" formula to remind you just how anxiety-inducing things can get in a horror game, and <em>Panicore </em>is a brilliant example of that. In this game, you and your friends are stuck in a dark facility, hunted by an unpredictable monster as you navigate tight corridors and dark paths to find a way out, debating if splitting up to find the right path would be better than sticking together.</p>    <p>Sounds simple enough, right? Except that the game <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/chrome-extension-scream-im-a-loser/" target="_blank">requires your mic to be on</a> at all times, because the unpredictable monster reacts to sound as well. This means that even a small shriek or even a sentence spoken out too loud could get you killed. Sneaking quietly then becomes incredibly important, and any information you share over comms is limited, delivered under the fear of the monster hearing you. The atmosphere is thick, the lighting is perfect, and the sense of helplessness is constant in <em>Panicore</em>.</p>

<p>Inarguably my favorite survival-horror co-op game, <em>The Outlast Trials</em> takes all the fear, anxiety, and vulnerability from the fantastic <em>Outlast </em>games and puts it into a well-crafted and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-reasons-for-the-return-of-local-couch-co-op/" target="_blank">deep co-op experience</a> that you and your friends won't ever get tired of. The single-player games were all about running away from all sorts of monsters and creatures, but <em>The Outlast Trials </em>gives you some options to tool up with your friends, investing in soft abilities that will definitely help you, but don't fool yourself into thinking you could take on the variety of horrors the game will throw at you.</p>    <p>You and your friends can go through an extensive number of trials, both quick and long, inside a Cold War-era testing facility, enduring gruesome "experiments" that push every limit of fear, endurance, and your sanity. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-co-op-horror-multiplayer-games-that-are-scary-and-funny/" target="_blank">Co-operation isn't a choice here</a>. You will have to heal each other, revive fallen teammates, or try to survive in pitch-black rooms while being hunted by some incredibly unsettling antagonists while you hunt for keys, solve puzzles to make progress, and go from one objective to the next.</p>    <p><em>The Outlast Trials </em>is grim, graphic, and genuinely unsettling, and yet, the shared suffering somehow makes it all fun. There's plenty of gore, violence, and bloodshed in the game, and it's also a great example of how heavily <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-art-styles-games/" target="_blank">visual design</a> can affect your playthrough. An absolute must-play, will undoubtedly leave you and your squad wanting more. It even has cross-play functionality, meaning you can play it with your friends who have it on Xbox or PlayStation.</p>

<p>Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?<br>
<br>
Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society. In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.<br>
Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete. Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.</p>

<h2>
Demonologist ($20)
</h2><h3>
Phasmophobia's evil cousin, realized in Unreal Engine 5
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-6-1314320404" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-6-1314320404" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-6-1314320404" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-6-1314320404" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-6-1314320404-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Think of <em>Demonologist </em>as <em>Phasmophobia</em>'s evil cousin. The game wears its Phasmophobia inspiration proudly, but also adds a level of production quality that makes it stand out. The sound design alone is a masterpiece in the game. Creaks, whispers, and sudden bangs, all get under your skin constantly, all mixed to make you doubt your own sanity. Each map feels alive, filled with little details that pull you in, with each map packed with terrifying jump scares and ghosts.</p>    <p>The gameplay loop here is rather reminiscent of <em>Phasmophobia</em>, where you identify the type of demon that is haunting the place before setting up traps for it and gathering evidence. The best part, however, is the game being built on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tired-of-broken-pc-ports-heres-how-unreal-engine-is-fixing-the-problem/" target="_blank">Unreal Engine 5</a>, which genuinely makes it look incredibly realistic and horrifying. <em>Demonologist </em>is remarkably intense and atmospheric, but also a blast with friends, because there's nothing funnier than watching your friend get jump-scared mid-sentence.</p>

Horror doesn't have to be a lonely experience

<div><p>Spooktober is always better when you suffer together.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Horror games are great for those who love fear in their video games, but only co-op horror brings with it a special kind of chaos. It's a sweet blend of fear and laughter, mixed in with frustration and triumph. Horror doesn't have to be a lonely experience at all, and when you face your fears with your friends, there's just nothing quite like it.</p>    <p>So this Halloween, grab your headsets, rally your friends, and prepare to scream, laugh, and maybe even stifle some of those shrieks, lest the ghost hear you, because Spooktober is always better when you suffer together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>Network-Attached Storage servers are some of the most useful devices you can add to your setup, regardless of whether you’re a casual user on the hunt for a file-sharing server or a hardcore privacy enthusiast looking to get rid of intrusive cloud platforms. If you’re as much of a data hoarder as I am, you’ll love the superior file archival, centralized storage, and easy recovery options offered by NAS rigs. </p>    <p>But even if you leave their backup-centric features aside, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-nas/" target="_blank">NAS devices</a> have a lot of utility in home lab environments. With how powerful yet affordable modern storage servers have become as of late, even a budget-friendly NAS can double as a reliable self-hosting workstation. If you’ve been using your NAS specifically for backup and file-transfer workloads, here are some reasons why you should try hosting a couple of services on it.</p>    <h2>
Plenty of storage space for your apps

<p>Although the self-hosted ecosystem has a variety of apps, many of them are centered around helping you manage huge amounts of data. There’s <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-reasons-plex-is-pushing-me-further-and-further-towards-jellyfin/" target="_blank">Jellyfin</a> for media, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-i-made-my-own-photo-hosting-platform-with-immich/" target="_blank">Immich</a> for photos, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/host-your-own-e-book-library-with-calibre-web/" target="_blank">Calibre-Web</a> for ebooks, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/host-paperless-ngx-on-your-home-lab/" target="_blank">Paperless-ngx</a> for documents, and Gitea for project repos – and those are just the popular ones. Frigate alone is capable of generating dozens of gigabytes worth of footage once you pair it with a couple of surveillance cameras. Even if you set data retention limits, you’ll still need enough storage capacity to house the daily footage. </p>    <p>Unless your server has a lot of HDDs slotted into it, you’re bound to run out of space while hosting these services – and I say that as someone who barely has enough storage capacity on my Proxmox node for my ebook and media library. A NAS becomes quite handy in this scenario, as typical 4-bay units offer enough capacity to store all your self-hosted archives. </p>    <p>And you can make your life a lot easier if you deploy your services directly on your storage server…</p>    <h2>
Directly use datasets to store app files

<p>If you’re running your self-hosted stack on a dedicated home server, apps like Jellyfin and Calibre-Web support using your NAS as the storage repository via network shares. The caveat? Network shares – especially those of the NFS variety – can be a massive pain to set up. NFS shares, in particular, require a lot of elbow grease to set up due to the way their permissions work. </p>    <p>And that’s before you throw unprivileged containers into the mix. For the uninitiated, unprivileged containers have some restrictions to heighten security – including one that stops you from mounting network shares directly. While you could use some workarounds to pair your NAS to them, a simple solution involves running containers directly on your NAS. That way, you can store essential data on your NAS datasets without dealing with annoying permissions and ACLs of network shares. </p>    <h2>

<p>Home lab setups may be characterized by bulky server PCs and entire racks’ worth of networking equipment, but you don’t need enterprise-grade hardware to self-host useful services. That’s because most pre-built and custom NAS distros let you deploy applications inside containers. Unlike their virtual machine counterparts, containers are fairly lightweight and don’t hog too many system resources, making them perfect for your average storage server.</p>    <p>NAS-centric operating systems also tend to ship with app stores/containerization platforms, which include hundreds of cool services that you can deploy with just the press of a button. Better yet, all the essential settings are laid out as toggles and options, so you don’t have to deal with long config files or complex terminal scripts in your self-hosted app stack. </p>    <h2>

<p>This is one of those unique mini PCs that's built with a purpose. Not only does it come in a relatively small size, but it also packs an incredible amount of power. It might not be for all, but if this mini PC speaks to you, we think it's a good time to pick one up since it's $600 off. </p>

      <![CDATA[<p>YouTube is packed with valuable tutorial videos, but I've always wanted a way to organize them in my own private learning space, a kind of personal classroom. Somewhere that allows me to have more control over what I watch, how I watch it, and, more importantly, reduces distractions from the internet.</p>    <p>After conducting a few experiments and a bit of fine-tuning, I successfully achieved my goal. By combining a few powerful tools, including yt-dlp, Whisper, and a note viewer, I built a setup that enabled me to learn efficiently. After setting up and doing my first few<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/notebooklm-learning-guide-feature/" target="_blank"> study sessions</a> with the arrangement, it felt like listening to my favorite teacher. But the advantages didn't stop there. I could pause, rewind, and take notes more easily. Here's how I did it.</p>    <h2>
Download YouTube videos with yt-dlp
</h2><h3>
Why not combine yt-dlp with FFmpeg?
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-933555900" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-933555900" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-933555900" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-933555900" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-933555900-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>yt-dlp is just an acronym for YouTube Downloader Plus. It's a tool that allows you to download videos from a wide range of websites, not just YouTube. It works on platforms such as Facebook, Vimeo, and Instagram, among others. You can extract useful data such as metadata, subtitles, and titles. Before downloading yt-dlp, it's worth noting that all the tools needed for this setup, including yt-dlp and Whisper, are Python tools. If you don't have Python on your computer, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">download it</a>. Then, you can download yt-dlp using the following PowerShell command.</p>    <blockquote>
<p>pip install yt-dlp</p>
</blockquote><p>After downloading yt-dlp, you can specify what you want from YouTube. You might choose to download just the audio or save the video on your computer. And the best part is that this flexibility comes at no cost. yt-dlp is an open-source tool; you can simply download and start using it immediately.</p>    <p>To fully enjoy yt-dlp, using it in tandem <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ffmpeg-commands-to-replace-basic-post-production-tools/" target="_blank">with FFmpeg </a>is always a nice idea. You see, YouTube servers store high-quality audio and video files separately. Which means that yt-dlp will simply be able to grab a YouTube audio file without images and a video file without sound. So that's where FFmpeg comes in. It helps merge the audio and video files harvested by yt-dlp into a single .mp4 or .webm file, which is exactly what you need for your offline classroom. To download FFmpeg, use the following command in PowerShell.</p>    <blockquote>
<p>winget install ffmpeg</p>
</blockquote>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>If you are creating a classroom with very long YouTube tutorials, e.g., 10 hours long, divide the video into smaller segments (10 minutes, for example) for easy transcription and breaks. To do this, execute the following command on your PowerShell after installing ffmpeg: <strong>ffmpeg -i "youtube video name. format" -f segment -segment_time 600 -reset_timestamps 1 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -c:a libopus "part_%03d.webm</strong></p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>With yt-dlp, you can build an extensive library of valuable and study videos and watch them without much distraction, but that's just a start. When you combine other tools, the learning experience becomes even better.</p>

Whisper for transcripts &amp; HTML for note-taking
</h2><h3>
How I made the tools work together
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Powershell Screenshot of whisper transcribing my tutorial video" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/whisper-transcribing-my-video.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> When watching a video in your offline classroom, it can be difficult to comprehend all the information as it plays. That's where Whisper comes in. <span><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/use-whisper-locally-on-pc-transcription-instead-otter-ai-how/" target="_blank">Whisper helps</a></span>you capture audio from your video content and convert it to text with the help of a Python script. It looks like a simple voice recognition tool, but its strength lies in its ability to create accurate YouTube video transcripts. Some other tools try to do the same, but most are not as accurate.</p>    <p>For my note viewer, I simply created it with an HTML code in Notepad. The HTML file also links all my classroom content together for easy access.</p>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot Html for displaying classroom content and creating a note viewer" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/html-for-classroom.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> With the note viewers, you can easily annotate text and later export a key section of your text to a different document. I use note viewers embedded in my HTML code in a browser for note-taking and recall. That's just to confirm that I've learned what I know. It's good to rewrite key points until the subject becomes a part of you.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>Add a JavaScript block to your HTML code to ensure you do not lose your notes when reloading your pages. From there, you can copy and store the notes as documents in your note folder.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>So here was how all the tools worked together: First, I made a general folder. Inside this folder, there are three different folders. I used yt-dlp to download my tutorial videos into one of the three folders. Also, with the help of the Python script, Whisper helped me to generate transcripts from my tutorial videos and save them in my second folder. I also have a folder for notes.</p>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of my general folder containing all classroom content" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-15-150707.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</div>
<p> In the general folder, I added the HTML. While it's possible to simply watch the videos directly from the video folder without using HTML code, the HTML code allowed me to view my setup in a browser. Simply opening my HTML file takes me directly to my browser, where my videos, transcripts, and a note viewer are displayed on the same page. As I watch the videos from the browser, I note vital points and write them down in the space my note viewer.</p>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of an offline classroom" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-of-offline-classroom.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>To ensure that all your tutorial videos and transcripts are available for browser access as the number of tutorial videos increases, don't forget to update your HTML file by adding new iframe lines that include your video and transcript file names.</p>    </div>

<h2>
Go offline and focus
</h2><h3>
A really nice way to limit distraction
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of an offline classroom setup displayed on a browser" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/note-vide-transcript-setup.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> An offline YouTube classroom offers numerous advantages for the average person, especially those who have struggled with concentration or with studying for extended periods without distractions. These days, I conduct my study sessions with my internet connection off, enjoying my offline classes in my browser. Since this switch, I have made significant progress as I now typically spend more hours genuinely watching the content.</p>    <p>The entire setup creates an offline classroom or website for serious studies. Interestingly, the setup ensures you don't have to pay for YouTube Premium to watch ad-free videos, and there are no more annoying ads tempting you to buy things you're trying to avoid. The benefits keep adding up, depending on how deep you want to dive into it.</p>    <h3>
You'll need the internet sometimes
</h3>
<p>Using this setup, you can better control your study environment and minimize external distractions. However, you may need to use the internet to gain a deeper understanding while studying offline. To address this, I simply jot down the questions or topics I wish to expand on during the study session. Once it ends, I can then conduct my research online. So whether you will find this setup ideal depends on your personal goals and study habits. However, if you want a distraction-free study environment, you should set it up.</p>]]>

Why not combine yt-dlp with FFmpeg?

<p>yt-dlp is just an acronym for YouTube Downloader Plus. It's a tool that allows you to download videos from a wide range of websites, not just YouTube. It works on platforms such as Facebook, Vimeo, and Instagram, among others. You can extract useful data such as metadata, subtitles, and titles. Before downloading yt-dlp, it's worth noting that all the tools needed for this setup, including yt-dlp and Whisper, are Python tools. If you don't have Python on your computer, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">download it</a>. Then, you can download yt-dlp using the following PowerShell command.</p>    <blockquote>
<p>pip install yt-dlp</p>
</blockquote><p>After downloading yt-dlp, you can specify what you want from YouTube. You might choose to download just the audio or save the video on your computer. And the best part is that this flexibility comes at no cost. yt-dlp is an open-source tool; you can simply download and start using it immediately.</p>    <p>To fully enjoy yt-dlp, using it in tandem <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ffmpeg-commands-to-replace-basic-post-production-tools/" target="_blank">with FFmpeg </a>is always a nice idea. You see, YouTube servers store high-quality audio and video files separately. Which means that yt-dlp will simply be able to grab a YouTube audio file without images and a video file without sound. So that's where FFmpeg comes in. It helps merge the audio and video files harvested by yt-dlp into a single .mp4 or .webm file, which is exactly what you need for your offline classroom. To download FFmpeg, use the following command in PowerShell.</p>    <blockquote>
<p>winget install ffmpeg</p>
</blockquote>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>If you are creating a classroom with very long YouTube tutorials, e.g., 10 hours long, divide the video into smaller segments (10 minutes, for example) for easy transcription and breaks. To do this, execute the following command on your PowerShell after installing ffmpeg: <strong>ffmpeg -i "youtube video name. format" -f segment -segment_time 600 -reset_timestamps 1 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -c:a libopus "part_%03d.webm</strong></p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>With yt-dlp, you can build an extensive library of valuable and study videos and watch them without much distraction, but that's just a start. When you combine other tools, the learning experience becomes even better.</p>

Whisper for transcripts &amp; HTML for note-taking
</h2><h3>
How I made the tools work together
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Powershell Screenshot of whisper transcribing my tutorial video" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/whisper-transcribing-my-video.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> When watching a video in your offline classroom, it can be difficult to comprehend all the information as it plays. That's where Whisper comes in. <span><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/use-whisper-locally-on-pc-transcription-instead-otter-ai-how/" target="_blank">Whisper helps</a></span>you capture audio from your video content and convert it to text with the help of a Python script. It looks like a simple voice recognition tool, but its strength lies in its ability to create accurate YouTube video transcripts. Some other tools try to do the same, but most are not as accurate.</p>    <p>For my note viewer, I simply created it with an HTML code in Notepad. The HTML file also links all my classroom content together for easy access.</p>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot Html for displaying classroom content and creating a note viewer" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/html-for-classroom.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> With the note viewers, you can easily annotate text and later export a key section of your text to a different document. I use note viewers embedded in my HTML code in a browser for note-taking and recall. That's just to confirm that I've learned what I know. It's good to rewrite key points until the subject becomes a part of you.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>Add a JavaScript block to your HTML code to ensure you do not lose your notes when reloading your pages. From there, you can copy and store the notes as documents in your note folder.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>So here was how all the tools worked together: First, I made a general folder. Inside this folder, there are three different folders. I used yt-dlp to download my tutorial videos into one of the three folders. Also, with the help of the Python script, Whisper helped me to generate transcripts from my tutorial videos and save them in my second folder. I also have a folder for notes.</p>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of my general folder containing all classroom content" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-15-150707.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</div>
<p> In the general folder, I added the HTML. While it's possible to simply watch the videos directly from the video folder without using HTML code, the HTML code allowed me to view my setup in a browser. Simply opening my HTML file takes me directly to my browser, where my videos, transcripts, and a note viewer are displayed on the same page. As I watch the videos from the browser, I note vital points and write them down in the space my note viewer.</p>

</div>
</div>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>To ensure that all your tutorial videos and transcripts are available for browser access as the number of tutorial videos increases, don't forget to update your HTML file by adding new iframe lines that include your video and transcript file names.</p>    </div>

<p> An offline YouTube classroom offers numerous advantages for the average person, especially those who have struggled with concentration or with studying for extended periods without distractions.

Since this switch, I have made significant progress as I now typically spend more hours genuinely watching the content.</p>    <p>The entire setup creates an offline classroom or website for serious studies. Interestingly, the setup ensures you don't have to pay for YouTube Premium to watch ad-free videos, and there are no more annoying ads tempting you to buy things you're trying to avoid.

You'll need the internet sometimes
</h3>
<p>Using this setup, you can better control your study environment and minimize external distractions. However, you may need to use the internet to gain a deeper understanding while studying offline. To address this, I simply jot down the questions or topics I wish to expand on during the study session. Once it ends, I can then conduct my research online. So whether you will find this setup ideal depends on your personal goals and study habits. However, if you want a distraction-free study environment, you should set it up.</p>]]>
