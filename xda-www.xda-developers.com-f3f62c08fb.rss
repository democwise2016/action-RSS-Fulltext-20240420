<p> LoggiFly's functionality is pretty simple for a self-hosted service. It listens to your container logs and notifies you when a log line matches the pattern or error code you are looking for. The app connects to the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/productivity-docker-containers-always-avoid/" target="_blank">Docker</a> engine through the local socket and reads the live output from each container. Instead of storing this information in a separate database, LoggiFly simply notifies you by reacting to what it sees in real time.</p>    <p>You can set up the app using the developer-provided Compose file and configure a few basic environment variables. This is also how you set up which containers to track and which keywords to look out for. More importantly, this is also how you define what notifications to send. LoggiFly supports both plain-text matches and regex rules, so you can get pretty granular with your log queries. LoggiFly is also smart enough to be reloaded without restarting the container. Whenever you change your rules and save them, LoggiFly will pick up the update and start acting on it.</p>    <p>The app gives you a couple of options for how you receive notifications. It integrates directly with ntfy, which is a rather simple notification service. But if you want to integrate it with a broader range of services, there's also Apprise support. Tapping into Apprise lets you connect LoggiFly with everything from Discord to Telegram, Slack, email, and more. You can even decide where you want specific alerts to show up. Critical errors might be routed to Discord DMs, while warnings could appear in a Slack channel. It's highly configurable to suit your requirements.</p>    <p>Elsewhere, if you want to take the functionality even further, LoggiFly can perform specific actions when a trigger is matched. For example, you can set it to automatically restart a container that has crashed or stop a service that keeps failing. While I haven't set this up, I prefer to investigate the root cause of issues before issuing a command. It can still be used to automate recovery for predictable issues.</p>    <p>Since LoggiFly is really just designed to alert you with essential notifications, there's no interface to speak of. There is no <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/zero-config-dashboard-i-wish-id-installed-on-day-one/" target="_blank">dashboard</a>, database, or even a front end. All configuration happens by adjusting the rules in the text file. An added benefit of that is the app is exceptionally lightweight and uses very little CPU or memory, making it ideal for NAS setups or even <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/this-is-my-favorite-raspberry-pi-project-of-all-time/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> stacks where you want to keep load to a minimum.</p>    <h2>

<p> If you're still on the fence about why you might want to run a service like this, there are a few good reasons. When you have multiple containers running, issues do pop up. And all too often, those issues go undiagnosed. Maybe your backup container failed, or there's been one too many failed authentications. Or perhaps, there's a background process restarting in a loop. Having a system that alerts you in real time can be extremely helpful. LoggiFly enables that. By being alerted to errors and issues in real time, you can take proactive measures to keep your stack running smoothly.</p>    <p>The ability to trigger actions automatically also gives it an edge. You can use it to restart containers when they get stuck, clear up errors, or run custom scripts. But most importantly, it's simple to use and has almost negligible overhead, making it an easy recommendation for an install.</p>    <h3>
A powerful watchdog for your Docker containers

<p>LoggiFly isn't the only tool that collects and visualizes logs, but very few focus purely on quick alerts.

      <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/notebooklm-is-more-powerful-than-initially-estimated/" target="_blank">NotebookLM is no doubt a powerful tool</a> for AI-assisted research and note-taking, but it’s not the only option for building a context-aware knowledge system.

<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/open-source-app-like-notion-but-better/" target="_blank">AFFiNE is another all-in-one productivity app</a> that will feel familiar if you’ve used apps like Kortex, Notion, Appflowy, and so on. It combines notes, tasks, projects, and tables into one workspace so you can organize your ideas and workflows however you want. One of its most popular features is that it's modular, so you can easily switch between things like editing documents or drawing in the whiteboard (called Edgeless). Overall, this is one of my top <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/swapped-notion-for-open-source-alternative/" target="_blank">open-source alternative recommendations for Notion</a> as it covers all those same project management needs plus more.</p>    <p>Where AFFiNE stands out is its AI assistant, which also uses RAG to draw data from your own notes and documents. Just like Kortex’s kAI, this lets AFFiNE’s AI summaries and suggestions be grounded in the content you’ve already created, plus, you can upload sources in the form of PDFs and images. Where it differs from Kortex and NotebookLM, however, is that it can access the web in real-time, letting you bring in fresh information and references without leaving the app. So as you’re synthesizing content from your AFFiNE documents, you can do some searching and brainstorming with the AI too.</p>    <p>Keep in mind that I’m using the cloud version of AFFiNE which has web search enabled by default. So if you’re running a self-hosted instance, you might have to configure an API key to access web search.</p>

</div>
<p>If you’re already deep into Obsidian, the Copilot plugin adds an AI assistant that works seamlessly with your existing notes. The AI reads and references pages you already created, giving context-aware suggestions and summaries right inside your vault. Once again, this AI uses RAG to pull from your notes to generate insights and overviews. There’s a dedicated chat panel in which you can specify the notes you want Copilot to pull from, but you can also highlight text in a document and prompt Copilot from there.</p>    <p>This plugin is especially useful for writers, in my opinion, who store their drafts and outlines in their vault. The AI can connect ideas across your documents that you might have overlooked, so you don’t miss anything important for your story. But it can also be a great tool for research and academic work – you can have Copilot synthesize your notes similarly to NotebookLM. Using Copilot for insights is one of my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ways-i-use-obsidian-that-have-nothing-to-do-with-note-taking/" target="_blank">top off-label uses for Obsidian</a>.</p>    <p>Unfortunately, access to web is reserved for the Copilot Plus tier. But the fact that you’re in the Obsidian ecosystem with immediate access to features like Canvas and Graph view makes it a more dynamic AI-assisted workspace than NotebookLM.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/open-source-app-like-notion-but-better/" target="_blank">AFFiNE is another all-in-one productivity app</a> that will feel familiar if you’ve used apps like Kortex, Notion, Appflowy, and so on. It combines notes, tasks, projects, and tables into one workspace so you can organize your ideas and workflows however you want. One of its most popular features is that it's modular, so you can easily switch between things like editing documents or drawing in the whiteboard (called Edgeless). Overall, this is one of my top <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/swapped-notion-for-open-source-alternative/" target="_blank">open-source alternative recommendations for Notion</a> as it covers all those same project management needs plus more.</p>    <p>Where AFFiNE stands out is its AI assistant, which also uses RAG to draw data from your own notes and documents. Just like Kortex’s kAI, this lets AFFiNE’s AI summaries and suggestions be grounded in the content you’ve already created, plus, you can upload sources in the form of PDFs and images. Where it differs from Kortex and NotebookLM, however, is that it can access the web in real-time, letting you bring in fresh information and references without leaving the app. So as you’re synthesizing content from your AFFiNE documents, you can do some searching and brainstorming with the AI too.</p>    <p>Keep in mind that I’m using the cloud version of AFFiNE which has web search enabled by default. So if you’re running a self-hosted instance, you might have to configure an API key to access web search.</p>

The Obsidian Copilot Plugin
</h2><h3>
Bring AI directly into your vault
</h3>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p>If you’re already deep into Obsidian, the Copilot plugin adds an AI assistant that works seamlessly with your existing notes. The AI reads and references pages you already created, giving context-aware suggestions and summaries right inside your vault. Once again, this AI uses RAG to pull from your notes to generate insights and overviews. There’s a dedicated chat panel in which you can specify the notes you want Copilot to pull from, but you can also highlight text in a document and prompt Copilot from there.</p>    <p>This plugin is especially useful for writers, in my opinion, who store their drafts and outlines in their vault. The AI can connect ideas across your documents that you might have overlooked, so you don’t miss anything important for your story. But it can also be a great tool for research and academic work – you can have Copilot synthesize your notes similarly to NotebookLM. Using Copilot for insights is one of my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ways-i-use-obsidian-that-have-nothing-to-do-with-note-taking/" target="_blank">top off-label uses for Obsidian</a>.</p>    <p>Unfortunately, access to web is reserved for the Copilot Plus tier. But the fact that you’re in the Obsidian ecosystem with immediate access to features like Canvas and Graph view makes it a more dynamic AI-assisted workspace than NotebookLM.</p>

NotebookLM isn’t the only option
</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/weird-ways-i-use-notebooklm-to-make-my-life-easier/" target="_blank">NotebookLM is great</a>, but these tools prove that you don’t need to stay tied to Google to get powerful RAG-based AI. Each one lets you build your own connected workspace and project management systems, pulling insights directly from that data, and that’s a productivity boost that NotebookLM doesn’t quite have.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Steam Deck's sleep mode works differently from most other gaming handhelds and consoles, giving it another edge over the competition.</p>    <p>However, the Steam Deck's sleep mode would be a fantastic addition to any Windows or Linux device, and really should become a more standard feature across most product lines.</p>    <h2>

<p>The Steam Deck's sleep mode includes system-level suspend, which saves the current state of the system, including your game, to RAM and stops handling any processing. This allows you to turn the Deck off in the middle of a game and resume directly where you left off when you wake the device. No logging back into the game or launching from the Steam library is required. Essentially, like you never turned the Steam Deck off to begin with. This way, you don't need to worry about manual saves or waiting for your game to boot up every time you take it out for a short gaming session.</p>    <p>This also means you can have multiple games running at once, with one game in suspension while the other is actively being played. Though that does come with a performance hit.</p>    <p>A few gaming handhelds offer a feature exactly like this. Nintendo's Switch and Switch 2 handhelds will put a game in suspension while in sleep mode, as did some handheld consoles in the past such as the PSP or Nintendo DS. However, modern PC-based gaming handhelds don't do this.</p>    <h2>

<p>Much like the Steam Deck itself, the handheld's sleep mode can be useful for other applications. Not only can you run note-taking software like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/obsidian-steam-deck-is-useful/" target="_blank">Obsidian on a Steam Deck</a>, you can also run <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-things-i-do-with-my-steam-deck-that-you-didnt-know-were-possible/" target="_blank">Android TV on a Deck</a> or use it as a set of portable speakers for your phone.</p>    <p>And the Deck's instant resume sleep mode can be a lifesaver when using the handheld in place of a desktop PC. After all, the Steam Deck's suspend-to-RAM feature works with any program. So you can resume your Android TV, VLC stream, or Obsidian note-taking right where you left off without a long boot or wake process, unlike standard laptop or desktop sleep modes.</p>    <p>And since the Deck's sleep mode doesn't require much in the way of CPU power, it takes far less battery to keep a game or program in suspend. This gives the Steam Deck a slight advantage over the Windows sleep process and makes it a more useful substitute for a laptop than a Windows-based handheld, especially given the Steam Deck's reliability and preservation of the system. How many times have you tried to sleep a Windows machine with a game running, only to find it either won't go to sleep at all, or randomly wakes up?</p>    <h2>

<p> The Steam Deck's custom operating system is based on the Arch Linux distro with the KDE Plasma desktop. This makes its suspend/resume behavior robust enough for most applications and games, but there are a few key drawbacks to the Steam Deck's sleep mode.</p>    <p>Because the level-suspend feature is built into the OS, it is generally reliable. However, some programs and applications may experience bugs or performance issues after resuming, leading to unresponsive scrolling controls. This can usually be solved by restarting the application, but that defeats the purpose of sleep mode.</p>    <p>Some games or applications also require a persistent internet connection. Sleep mode often interferes with this connection, which may cause the game or application to lose connection during suspend. Online games like MMOs or competitive PvP titles are the most likely to have issues with this, but it also applies to non-gaming programs like video streaming services. Of course, this would be a problem even if sleep mode worked like it does on Windows.</p>    <p>More importantly, because the Steam Deck's sleep mode works the way it does, it won't download a game or file while in sleep. Granted, this is true of just about any operating system, so it isn't unique to the Steam Deck. It does mean that you'll want to leave the deck powered on with the display off while downloading large files, however.</p>    <h2>

<p>Technically, Windows supports suspend-to-RAM (S3) or Modern Standby (S0) sleep states. However, the Windows sleep mode is buggy and isn't optimized for gaming. So not only does Windows sleep sometimes result in a bug where your device won't wake from sleep and needs to be restarted, it can also drain more battery in sleep mode. Windows sleep mode sometimes causes a device to wake unexpectedly or fail to sleep in the first place.</p>    <p>The Steam Deck's sleep mode is far more reliable and is optimized for gaming, so you won't have to restart your game when waking your Steam Deck from sleep. And that kind of reliability is an absolute lifesaver, even just for general productivity tasks.</p>    <p>If Windows can offer an optimized sleep mode at least for handhelds, that would be ideal.

And that kind of reliability is an absolute lifesaver, even just for general productivity tasks.</p>    <p>If Windows can offer an optimized sleep mode at least for handhelds, that would be ideal. But really, we need better sleep modes across all Windows devices—from tablets to desktops—because the existing feature just doesn't cut it.</p>    <div popover="manual"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of Flatpak’s biggest strengths is its universality. It works across virtually every major Linux distribution, right out of the box. Fedora, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, <a href="https://bazzite.gg/" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>, and Nobara all ship with Flatpak pre-installed and enabled by default. Even Ubuntu, which traditionally pushes its own Snap format, supports Flatpak through a single install command.</p>    <p>This means developers can publish one version of their app that will work across many different distros, regardless of what's under the hood. It has especially helped me, as someone who distro-hops quite frequently. My Flatpak installs behave exactly the same no matter which distro I happen to be on.</p>    <h2>

<p>If you've used Linux for any significant amount of time, there's a good chance you've run into some kind of dependency issues. Installing one package that demands a different version of some shared library that, when changed, breaks something else. It can be a huge drag to deal with manually, but this is one of the problems Flatpak was built to solve.</p>    <p>Instead of relying on whatever library versions your distro happens to include, Flatpak packages bring their own environment, known as a runtime. These runtimes are prebuilt collections of libraries and dependencies maintained separately from your system. This sandboxed, self-contained design completely eliminates version conflicts and makes software so much more predictable. It also doesn't stack these runtimes across apps; if one library is shared by multiple apps, it doesn't store duplicates of them, saving space.</p>    <h2>

<p>One of Flatpak's most underrated features is how it handles updates and rollbacks. Every time you update an app, the old version isn't deleted or overwritten. Instead, it is kept as a snapshot, so if the new version misbehaves, you can easily roll back to the previous version. This kind of safety net is pretty rare when it comes to Linux package managers, especially when an update replaces file permanently.

<p>Flatpak isn’t perfect. Apps can take up a bit more space, and system integration isn’t always flawless.

      <![CDATA[<p>This week, we're finally getting gaming handhelds with Xbox branding. Microsoft and Asus partnered to create and release the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/someone-got-sent-rog-xbox-ally-x-super-early/" target="_blank">ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, which are Steam Deck-like handhelds with a tailor-made version of Windows 11 for on-the-go PC gaming. And while no first-party Xbox games come out on the exact same day as these handhelds, the general launch window lineup is fairly strong.</p>    <p>With the first month of ROG Xbox Ally handhelds being on the market, Microsoft-owned studios will publish four brand-new games playable on the handhelds. If you're willing to spend a lot of money on the handheld at release, you won't have a shortage of Xbox-made games to play. Even with all the other issues Xbox is currently facing, this is the strongest launch window lineup for new Xbox hardware <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xbox-360-classics-that-run-dramatically-better-series-x-s/" target="_blank">since the Xbox 360</a>.</p>    <p>In particular, it's much stronger than the Xbox Series X and S' launch window lineup, which was one of the worst in Xbox history for new games.</p>    <h2>
Looking back at the Xbox Series X's launch lineup

Gears Tactics and a lot of remasters

<p>Nearly five years ago, Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles on November 10, 2020. Normally, console manufacturers have a suite of new first-party games launching around that window. In the PS5's case, we got games like <em>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Sackboy: A Big Adventure</em>, and <em>Demon's Souls</em> in addition to the pack-in title <em>Astro's Playroom</em>.</p>    <p>For a more modern example, Nintendo Switch 2 launched with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/cant-stop-playing-mario-kart-world-knockout-tour-online/" target="_blank"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of Zelda games, and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-played-nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-so-you-dont-have-to/" target="_blank"><em>Welcome Tour</em></a>, with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush-dlc-is-good-fan-service-but-thats-it/" target="_blank"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> following close behind about a month after launch. In Microsoft's case, the crown jewel of its Xbox Series X and S launch window lineup was the console port of <em>Gears Tactics</em>, a strategy game released on PC in April of that year.</p>    <p>You may remember that <em>Halo Infinite</em> was supposed to be the marquee title at launch, but it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x" target="_blank">delayed by a full year</a>. After the delay, the first-party launch window lineup consisted only of <em>Gears Tactics</em> and next-gen upgrades for previously released games like <em>Forza Horizon 4, Gears 5, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Sea of Thieves, Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>, and <em>State of Decay 2</em>.</p>    <p>While those are all good games, in retrospect, that's a very underwhelming lineup. If you owned an Xbox One, there was only one new first-party game to look forward to. And while I love <em>Gears Tactics</em>, a niche strategy game like that isn't exactly launch-title caliber on its own. That exemplified Xbox's first-party issues in the late 2010s and early 2020s, which it only started to recover from a couple of years ago.</p>    <h2>
The ROG Xbox Ally handheld's launch lineup is much more bountiful

<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds launch on October 16. Within the first month, we can expect the following games to be published by studios that Microsoft owns:</p>        <ul>
<li>
November 17: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/keeper-double-fine-gamescom-pc-xbox-gamescom-2025" target="_blank"><em>Keeper</em></a>, developed by Double Fine and published by Xbox Game Studios

</li>
<li>
November 29: <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/the-outer-worlds-2-preview" target="_blank"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a>, developed by Double Fine and published by Xbox Game Studios
</li>
<li>
November 14: <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-needs-to-be-harsher-against-cheating/" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>, developed by Treyarch and published by Activision (which Microsoft owns).
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these games suits a PC gaming handheld in different ways. Keeper is the kind of cozy, atmospheric, dialogue-less game that suits on-the-go play. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>are AAA-level games that feel impressive to play on a tiny console. Finally, Call of Duty games are among the most popular game releases every year, so being able to play <em>Black Ops 7</em> anywhere they want is a major bonus.</p>    <p>They're all brand-new, too; no remaster or ports here. If you do choose to get one of these new Xbox handhelds at release, you will have a healthy stream of compelling new games to check out for the first month of the device's lifespan. You couldn't say that about the Xbox Series X and S until almost a year after they were released, indicating just how much Xbox's first-party release cadence has gotten in recent years.</p>    <p>Of course, this is not to say these handhelds are launching at the perfect time for Xbox.

Even these handhelds will cost prospective buyers upwards of $1000.

      <![CDATA[<p>This week, we're finally getting gaming handhelds with Xbox branding. Microsoft and Asus partnered to create and release the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/someone-got-sent-rog-xbox-ally-x-super-early/" target="_blank">ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, which are Steam Deck-like handhelds with a tailor-made version of Windows 11 for on-the-go PC gaming. And while no first-party Xbox games come out on the exact same day as these handhelds, the general launch window lineup is fairly strong.</p>    <p>With the first month of ROG Xbox Ally handhelds being on the market, Microsoft-owned studios will publish four brand-new games playable on the handhelds. If you're willing to spend a lot of money on the handheld at release, you won't have a shortage of Xbox-made games to play. Even with all the other issues Xbox is currently facing, this is the strongest launch window lineup for new Xbox hardware <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xbox-360-classics-that-run-dramatically-better-series-x-s/" target="_blank">since the Xbox 360</a>.</p>    <p>In particular, it's much stronger than the Xbox Series X and S' launch window lineup, which was one of the worst in Xbox history for new games.</p>    <h2>

<p>Nearly five years ago, Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles on November 10, 2020. Normally, console manufacturers have a suite of new first-party games launching around that window. In the PS5's case, we got games like <em>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Sackboy: A Big Adventure</em>, and <em>Demon's Souls</em> in addition to the pack-in title <em>Astro's Playroom</em>.</p>    <p>For a more modern example, Nintendo Switch 2 launched with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/cant-stop-playing-mario-kart-world-knockout-tour-online/" target="_blank"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of Zelda games, and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-played-nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-so-you-dont-have-to/" target="_blank"><em>Welcome Tour</em></a>, with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush-dlc-is-good-fan-service-but-thats-it/" target="_blank"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> following close behind about a month after launch. In Microsoft's case, the crown jewel of its Xbox Series X and S launch window lineup was the console port of <em>Gears Tactics</em>, a strategy game released on PC in April of that year.</p>    <p>You may remember that <em>Halo Infinite</em> was supposed to be the marquee title at launch, but it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x" target="_blank">delayed by a full year</a>. After the delay, the first-party launch window lineup consisted only of <em>Gears Tactics</em> and next-gen upgrades for previously released games like <em>Forza Horizon 4, Gears 5, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Sea of Thieves, Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>, and <em>State of Decay 2</em>.</p>    <p>While those are all good games, in retrospect, that's a very underwhelming lineup. If you owned an Xbox One, there was only one new first-party game to look forward to. And while I love <em>Gears Tactics</em>, a niche strategy game like that isn't exactly launch-title caliber on its own. That exemplified Xbox's first-party issues in the late 2010s and early 2020s, which it only started to recover from a couple of years ago.</p>    <h2>

      <![CDATA[<p>I'll go out on a limb here: if you have an RTX 30 or RX 6000 series GPU, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dont-buy-new-gpu-do-this-instead/" target="_blank">you're probably considering a GPU upgrade</a>. PC gamers have this unquenchable thirst for new hardware, mostly GPUs, that's renewed each time a new product generation arrives.

<p>Immersion is subjective, but I think most of us will agree that a 22" or 24" monitor just doesn't cut it anymore. When I first moved to a flat-screen 22" TN panel around 15 years ago, it felt like a massive upgrade over my 15" CRT monitor. Today, however, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/27-inch-monitors-are-the-sweet-spot-for-gamers/" target="_blank">a 27" gaming monitor is considered the bare minimum</a> for an immersive gaming setup.

You could consider 32" displays, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-nobody-tells-you-before-buying-curved-monitor/" target="_blank">curved ultrawide monitors</a>, or straight-up gaming TVs if your budget permits. Of course, you need to be cognizant of your preferences and the size of your desk as well.

<p>The resolution of your monitor might not feel like a huge factor if you're still using a 1080p display.

This is why <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-i-still-game-at-1440p-instead-of-4k/" target="_blank">1440p is the sweet spot for gaming</a> even in 2025; it plays well with a 27" screen size in terms of the PPI.

When I upgraded to a 1440p monitor four years ago, my GTX 1660 Ti never struggled to maintain 60+ FPS in most titles. If you own a 5-year-old GPU that used to be somewhat high-end back then, it can reasonably power 1440p gaming in 2025, provided you enable upscaling and maybe frame generation (in some cases). Once you're able to appreciate the appeal of 1440p over 1080p, you'll struggle to go back. </p>    <h2>

Once you're confident that your GPU will be able to support a more powerful monitor, with or without the aid of upscaling and frame generation, it's time to check whether your current monitor is due for an upgrade.</p>    <h2>
Your monitor doesn't feel immersive

A 27-inch display is the new minimum

<p>Immersion is subjective, but I think most of us will agree that a 22" or 24" monitor just doesn't cut it anymore. When I first moved to a flat-screen 22" TN panel around 15 years ago, it felt like a massive upgrade over my 15" CRT monitor. Today, however, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/27-inch-monitors-are-the-sweet-spot-for-gamers/" target="_blank">a 27" gaming monitor is considered the bare minimum</a> for an immersive gaming setup. These monitors aren't expensive anymore, and you can get a decent hi-res, high-refresh-rate model from one of the reputable brands for as low as $160. </p>    <p>Size alone won't cut it when you're shopping for a gaming display, but it's the foundation for an enjoyable gaming experience. You could consider 32" displays, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-nobody-tells-you-before-buying-curved-monitor/" target="_blank">curved ultrawide monitors</a>, or straight-up gaming TVs if your budget permits. Of course, you need to be cognizant of your preferences and the size of your desk as well. The bigger you go, however, the higher the resolution needed to sustain image clarity, especially when it's a display that sits inches away from your eyes. </p>    <h2>
You can almost count the pixels

1440p is the new 1080p
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Stellar Blade PC demo running on an RTX 3080." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/06/stellar-blade-3080-1080p-first-jumps.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">

</div>
<p>The resolution of your monitor might not feel like a huge factor if you're still using a 1080p display. On a relatively smaller screen, 1920x1080 is a perfectly adequate resolution for gaming, but as you climb higher in display size, a resolution increase is necessary to maintain image sharpness. This is why <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-i-still-game-at-1440p-instead-of-4k/" target="_blank">1440p is the sweet spot for gaming</a> even in 2025; it plays well with a 27" screen size in terms of the PPI. The jump from 1080p to 1440p brings a massive jump in pixel count, enhancing the image quality tangibly.</p>    <p>1440p isn't as heavy as 4K on your graphics card, but the upgrade feels real. When I upgraded to a 1440p monitor four years ago, my GTX 1660 Ti never struggled to maintain 60+ FPS in most titles. If you own a 5-year-old GPU that used to be somewhat high-end back then, it can reasonably power 1440p gaming in 2025, provided you enable upscaling and maybe frame generation (in some cases). Once you're able to appreciate the appeal of 1440p over 1080p, you'll struggle to go back. </p>    <h2>
PC gaming feels like console gaming

Abandon your 60Hz monitor already
</h3>

<p>Consoles like PS5 and Xbox Series X are still stuck at 60 FPS in many AAA titles. If your gaming PC delivers the same experience, what's the point of choosing a superior platform, yet sticking to a subpar experience? Your 60Hz monitor might feel okay if you're used to it, but it's high time you got a taste of what high-refresh-rate gaming feels like. When you first jump from a 60Hz display to a 144Hz or 180Hz display, you'll wonder how you stayed at 60Hz for years. Fortunately, 27" 1440p 180Hz displays are easily available for under $200 now. </p>    <p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/switching-from-console-to-pc-makes-sense/" target="_blank">Consoles are great at what they do</a>, especially at the price point, but the smoothness that 100+ FPS injects into your gaming experience is unparalleled. With quality upscaling, even older GPUs can pump out high framerates in most modern games. The only change you need to make? — swap your ancient 60Hz display for a high-refresh-rate model, and see the magic happen. With <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/freesync-vs-g-sync/" target="_blank">FreeSync or G-SYNC</a>, your new monitor will be able to eliminate visual artifacts even if your FPS can't saturate the refresh rate of the screen.</p>    <h2>

<p>If you're rocking an antique display, it could very well have a TN panel. These panels have been superseded in every aspect by modern <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ips-va-tn-oled-gaming-monitor/" target="_blank">VA, IPS, Mini LED, and OLED monitors</a>. Be it color reproduction, response times, viewing angles, high contrast, or brightness, today's VA and IPS monitors feel like a new species compared to TN models of yore. You don't even need to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/wish-i-knew-switching-from-ips-oled-monitor/" target="_blank">switch to an OLED monitor</a> to see a massive difference from your old TN display. Even a high-quality VA monitor from the likes of Samsung will be a far cry from your old monitor. </p>    <p>Most high-quality VA monitors will boast better contrast than IPS monitors, but the latter will usually excel in color reproduction. When shopping for a new monitor, it's best to consult reviews of particular models before making a decision. If you have the budget to spare, you could consider an older but still excellent <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-no-one-told-me-about-ultrawide-oled-monitor/" target="_blank">OLED ultrawide monitor</a>, such as the Alienware AW3423DWF, which frequently retails for around $550–$600. Newer OLED monitors can also be had for around $500, and tandem WOLED monitors have started to arrive on the market at around the same price.</p>

<h3>
It might be time for a modern gaming display
</h3>
<p>If you've been rocking a monitor that launched 10 years ago, it could be overdue for an upgrade. A high-quality gaming experience demands a large and immersive display with a high resolution and refresh rate. A jump from a TN panel to a VA or IPS model could be all you need in terms of an image quality upgrade. Instead of replacing a GPU that's still capable of high-refresh-rate gaming, it's better to bring your display game to the modern age. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>Our increasingly connected world runs on several layers of networking stacks that help route, find, and receive data from external sources. But that's not the only way to communicate digitally, even if the     <span><a href="/things-using-ip-as-transport-layer/" target="_blank">IP-based networking</a></span> stack that runs the internet is the generally accepted method.

These solutions still layer new protocols over the accepted IP-based network stack, but other ways exist to achieve the same goal.</p>    <p>One is called Reticulum, an open-source, cryptography-based network stack. It's the protocol and transport layers for making secure, decentralized, and resilient local or wide-area networks, designed to be medium-agnostic, in that it works on almost any transmission medium that could reliably pass a few bytes at a time. It's pretty neat, but tricky to use on its own, but that's what the VPN built on top of the Reticulum stack handles for you.</p>    <h2>
What is Reticulum anyway?

And why do we need another networking stack?

<p>Reticulum uses existing hardware, like LoRa radios, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, serial lines or anything else that can pass data and turns it into a mesh-based network stack. But it can also be used over external programs, or piped over existing IP networks, so it's completely medium agnostic. While traditional networking uses IP allocations for addressing individual devices, Reticulum uses a concept of <strong>destinations</strong>, which are defined using cryptographic keys.</p>    <p>It doesn't require centralized infrastructure, can be designed as open or needs authentication to join the mesh, and uses full end-to-end encryption for data in transit. It needs no drivers, no kernel modules, and runs on anything Python 3 can run, making it a fully software-defined networking solution.</p>    <p><strong>Differences from the traditional network stack:</strong></p>    <div>

<p>It's also low-bandwidth, designed to work on anything with a half-duplex channel with 5 bits per second and MTU of 500 bytes as a minimum. That adds radios and a whole scope of low-power IoT devices into the mix for the mesh, making it great for off-grid messaging, remote sensors, disaster response, or anyone who could benefit from a decentralized, encrypted network.</p>    <h3>
It's built to be secure with <em>initiator anonymity</em>
</h3>
<p>Because cryptographic keys identify nodes on the network, nothing else about the device being used, the user using it, or anything else that might identify it is passed on across the network. All communications are secured by ECDH X25519 key exchange, with AES-128/256 encryption. The network doesn't reveal anything about the identity of the sender of a message <em>by default and design</em>, making this secure by design and without the overhead and cruft of IP networking.</p>    <h3>
Reticulum is pretty neat on its own

</div>
</div>
<p>Reticulum doesn't need much to get going, with a simple <strong>pip</strong> package manager command to install:</p>    <pre>pip install rns<br></pre>    <p>or <strong>pipx</strong> as it was on my Ubuntu install.</p>    <p>That's all it takes to get Reticulum running on your device, but then what programs can you use with it? Well, there's <a href="https://github.com/markqvist/nomadnet" target="_blank">Nomad Network</a> which is a spy thriller-esque encrypted communications suite that has synchronous, asynchronous, and file-sharing capabilities. Or the GUI-based <a href="https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat" target="_blank">Reticulum MeshChat</a> app that works on macOS and Windows.</p>    <p>That's only the surface of what you can do, and remember, these apps don't need any connections to the public internet to work. They don't even need Ethernet, or IP networks, or any existing network functionality at all.</p>

Reticulum with a P2P VPN over the top makes it work with existing software

</div>
<p> Now that we've got a completely new software-defined networking stack, we can do all kinds of things with it. The <a href="https://github.com/BeechatNetworkSystemsLtd/rns-vpn-rs" target="_blank">rns-vpn project</a> builds a P2P VPN over the Reticulum mesh network, which had me scratching my head for a minute because it adds encryption again on top of an already encrypted network, until I realized why.</p>    <p>The extra encryption is to preserve the privacy-by-design of Reticulum while adding a static IP address to each node in the mesh. This keeps you private, but lets the users use existing IP-based tools to communicate, as you can reach each peer with its assigned IP address.</p>    <p>The configuration file for this basically has a list of the cryptographic LXMF address that Reticulum uses and an assigned IP address for the VPN to use:</p>    <pre>vpn_ip = "10.0.0.1/24"<br><br>[peers]<br>"10.0.0.2" = "xxx"</pre>    <p>An LXMF address looks like <strong>4faf1b2e0a077e6a9d92fa051f256038,</strong> and would go where the <strong>xxx</strong> is in the config file. The neat thing is that because it's a hash, you can have multiple devices on the network with the same app or device name, because the destination hash will still be unique.</p>    <h3>
This is similar to ZeroTier in many ways
</h3>
<p>Using a VPN over Reticulum is similar to how     <span><a href="/why-zerotier-is-the-best-tailscale-alternative-for-your-home-lab/" target="_blank">ZeroTier</a></span> works over an IP-based internet stack, in that you can transparently route traffic over the mesh to individual clients, without needing to add your own networking code to your applications. It's a little different in that the VPN over Reticulum lets you add a static IP address to the cryptographic identifier for each node, so you can use IP-based apps over the Reticulum network without having to reverse engineer anything. That's pretty smart, reducing the barrier to entry for this potentially life-saving networking stack that's perfect for disaster rescue and recovery missions and more.    </p>

Make your own mesh network with encryption and resilient networking
</h3>
<p>Reticulum isn't the only alternative network stack out there, but it has some real promise in the sheer number of devices that can run it. Think mesh networks for remote villages or those underserved communities where robust internet infrastructure has yet to arrive. It enables free, encrypted messaging over radio communications, or almost anything else that can carry a signal, and connects each device into a unified mesh network for the community.</p>]]>

<p> Now that we've got a completely new software-defined networking stack, we can do all kinds of things with it. The <a href="https://github.com/BeechatNetworkSystemsLtd/rns-vpn-rs" target="_blank">rns-vpn project</a> builds a P2P VPN over the Reticulum mesh network, which had me scratching my head for a minute because it adds encryption again on top of an already encrypted network, until I realized why.</p>    <p>The extra encryption is to preserve the privacy-by-design of Reticulum while adding a static IP address to each node in the mesh. This keeps you private, but lets the users use existing IP-based tools to communicate, as you can reach each peer with its assigned IP address.</p>    <p>The configuration file for this basically has a list of the cryptographic LXMF address that Reticulum uses and an assigned IP address for the VPN to use:</p>    <pre>vpn_ip = "10.0.0.1/24"<br><br>[peers]<br>"10.0.0.2" = "xxx"</pre>    <p>An LXMF address looks like <strong>4faf1b2e0a077e6a9d92fa051f256038,</strong> and would go where the <strong>xxx</strong> is in the config file. The neat thing is that because it's a hash, you can have multiple devices on the network with the same app or device name, because the destination hash will still be unique.</p>    <h3>

<p>Using a VPN over Reticulum is similar to how     <span><a href="/why-zerotier-is-the-best-tailscale-alternative-for-your-home-lab/" target="_blank">ZeroTier</a></span> works over an IP-based internet stack, in that you can transparently route traffic over the mesh to individual clients, without needing to add your own networking code to your applications. It's a little different in that the VPN over Reticulum lets you add a static IP address to the cryptographic identifier for each node, so you can use IP-based apps over the Reticulum network without having to reverse engineer anything. That's pretty smart, reducing the barrier to entry for this potentially life-saving networking stack that's perfect for disaster rescue and recovery missions and more.    </p>

Make your own mesh network with encryption and resilient networking
</h3>
<p>Reticulum isn't the only alternative network stack out there, but it has some real promise in the sheer number of devices that can run it. Think mesh networks for remote villages or those underserved communities where robust internet infrastructure has yet to arrive. It enables free, encrypted messaging over radio communications, or almost anything else that can carry a signal, and connects each device into a unified mesh network for the community.</p>]]>
    </description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our increasingly connected world runs on several layers of networking stacks that help route, find, and receive data from external sources. But that's not the only way to communicate digitally, even if the     <span><a href="/things-using-ip-as-transport-layer/" target="_blank">IP-based networking</a></span> stack that runs the internet is the generally accepted method. There are many compromises in its design, tracing back to the origin of the Internet Protocol, and there are other ways to do things.    </p>    <p>Decentralized mesh networks are one, and if you've used <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-running-own-vpn-server-instead-vpn-provider/" target="_blank">any of the next-gen VPN solutions</a> like Tailscale or ZeroTier, you have some idea of what I'm talking about. These solutions still layer new protocols over the accepted IP-based network stack, but other ways exist to achieve the same goal.</p>    <p>One is called Reticulum, an open-source, cryptography-based network stack. It's the protocol and transport layers for making secure, decentralized, and resilient local or wide-area networks, designed to be medium-agnostic, in that it works on almost any transmission medium that could reliably pass a few bytes at a time. It's pretty neat, but tricky to use on its own, but that's what the VPN built on top of the Reticulum stack handles for you.</p>    <h2>
What is Reticulum anyway?

And why do we need another networking stack?

      <![CDATA[<p>With the release of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> coming up in November 2025, everyone will be getting ready to hop online for the game's multiplayer modes. And as many gamers know, things can get chaotic in multiplayer matches with any <em>Call of Duty</em> game. Whether you're playing team deathmatch or any objective game type, it's going to be hectic one way or another. But with the craziness of online matches going on, players are always complaining about often getting killed and having a major disadvantage. And unfortunately, some of it may be due to things they're doing wrong while spawning into matches of their favorite playlists.</p>    <p>Not every loss and terrible set up during a multiplayer match of <em>Call of Duty</em> is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-needs-to-be-harsher-against-cheating" target="_blank">due to someone cheating</a> or getting matched up with a professional clan. Sometimes you're getting killed because you're not playing well, or you're not doing something important that can help keep the advantage for your team. And it happens more often than one might realize, especially if you find the kill cam showing up more often than you would like. Here are four things everybody does wrong in <em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer matches all the time, and how to be proactive when correcting them.</p>

Wasting grenades
</h2><h3>
Throwing stuff out carelessly

<p>Let's be totally honest, everybody finds themselves wasting grenades all the time. Whether that comes from throwing lethal or tactical grenades across the map, or just never using them at all, wasting grenades is a bad move. Most players may not even realize they're doing it too, especially when one is so focused on getting into a shooting match with other players. Grenades are a good compliment to the rest of your arsenal, but they should never be carelessly thrown when you don't need to. Not every <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer</a> map you find yourself on will be small like Nuketown or Shipment, so lobbing one in the sky won't always hit an enemy player.</p>    <p>While different <em>Call of Duty</em> games have variations on grenades, including interesting ones like the pinpoint grenade in <em>Black Ops 7</em>, they are all meant for the same key function. Flushing out or disorienting teams with their effects and explosion radius. This means grenades are ideal for throwing into tight rooms, around choke points with nearby enemies, and nearby hiding spots where you know someone is located. Carelessly wasting grenades by throwing them after spawning or never using them when they count is a surefire way to give up the advantage to the other team. A well-placed grenade at the right moment can break up skirmishes and can shift momentum back into your favor, especially if you manage to kill a few enemies in the process and gain a killstreak.</p>

<p> The best way to start using grenades <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-battlefield-6-is-doing-better-than-call-of-duty-black-ops-7" target="_blank">a lot smarter in multiplayer</a> is to hold back on using them early on. Don't use them at the start of matches, and avoid running into place where others may frequently throw grenades. Wait for moments when you might be entering a room or corridor on the map that players are flocking to, like a capture point in Domination matches, and then throw them in before entering. This will force players to react if they're being careless in the area or too slow to get away before your grenade explodes, either giving you free kills or setting you up to get some. Grenades can be a player's best friend to make big moves onto objectives or keep someone from getting a very big killstreak, so don't waste them so easily.</p>    <h2>
Rushing into firefights
</h2><h3>
Sprinting after spawning is a bad idea
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1373755208" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1373755208" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1373755208" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1373755208" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1373755208-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Another big issue that every <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/activision-vs-call-of-duty-cheaters" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em> player struggles</a> with is rushing into the conflict. If you spawn back on your side of the map, you might be eager to get back into the fight where you were last killed, only to find yourself dead again from a similar scenario. Being in a rush to get back at the other team is one of the easiest ways to give them free kills, especially on smaller maps where you can take so few steps before someone has you in their crosshair. And while some maps in <em>Call of Duty</em> can have bad spawning spots that lock teams in bad situations, not every map can suffer from this all the time. The opposing team may be getting quick kills because you and your teammates are not assessing the situation and rushing into the fight.</p>    <p>Smaller maps can make this a real devastating problem for teams on the losing end of a match, but larger maps can also set up trigger-happy players for failure. If you spawn on the opposite side of the map and just rush into the open area to get back to where the action is, you leave yourself open to those with long-range rifles and can end up giving them a free kill. The best way to correct this is to stop yourself before hitting the sprint button to get back out there, and instead try a different route or approach to where the fight is taking place. This can mean going in a different area of the map for a better vantage point, or using doorways and objects on the map as cover while moving around differently.</p>

<p> The benefit of this is keeping the other team from getting so many kills at a faster rate, especially when your teammates might not be helping the situation. The fewer kills you give up to the other team, the harder it is for them to get larger killstreaks and the more chances for you to turn the tide. At the same time, taking the extra moments to regroup and reassess things can give you opportunities to spot enemies that might be hiding in spots they can easily shoot players passing by. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer can be hectic</a> and constantly changing, but what you contribute to the chaos can be controlled with a cooler head by not rushing back to where you may have been killed.</p>    <h2>
Not optimizing loadouts
</h2><h3>
Gearing towards your playstyle
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A screenshot of combat specialties from the multiplayer beta of Call of Duty Black Ops 7" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/blackops7_callofdutyblackops7beta_25.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">

<p> A key part of online multiplayer matches in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-and-modern-warfare-series-ranked" target="_blank">any <em>Call of Duty</em> game</a> is making sure you have the right equipment on hand. If you're going to be on a larger map for one game type, then it might make sense to use longer-ranged weapons with good scopes. For smaller maps, you may be able to use mid to short range weapons with perks that allow you to take advantage of the smaller area. The key takeaway is to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-2026-leaked-battle-pass" target="_blank">optimize the loadout</a> you bring into the match, and have other loadouts to pick from later if things change mid-match. But some players mistakenly don't do this often, and instead pick whatever others are using or what is quick to grab at the moment.</p>    <p>Everyone's playstyle online is different, which means that most people won't use the same weapons or perks in the same fashion. While <em>Call of Duty</em> games give the flexibility to utilize perks and equipment for opposing styles, the majority of success will come from putting together something that works best for you individually. This can come from picking weapons and attachments for them that go hand-in-hand with specific perks that enhance your approach to fighting, not giving you a random bonus that you won't take advantage of often. This is why browsing through your loadouts and tinkering with them is very important, because it will make some of the more frustrating aspects of multiplayer matches a bit more manageable. It can lead to closer games and possibly more wins rather than consecutive losses online.</p>

<p> If you're in an objective game type and don't get many kills, then having perks that cater to completing objectives and reducing killstreak costs can be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/5-playstation-franchises-that-deserve-a-themed-ps5-dualsense-controller" target="_blank">a real difference maker</a>. Or if getting kills easier is the main goal, then finding ways to use equipment that disrupt opponents can help make that easier. But when you're not changing your loadout to fit your playstyle, or just going with what is working for others all the time, you leave yourself open to becoming fodder for players who do take the moment to create better loadouts for themselves.</p>    <h2>

<p>Most people love the idea of camping in one spot and watching as players run by for them to shoot easily. They feel this can always work if they find the right spot and have to do the least amount of work in a match to win. And while camping in sections of a map can be a viable strategy, despite how much people may hate it, it's not an all-purpose solution online. Most players who camp in single areas will often find themselves killed by someone they don't see coming, either from behind or out of their view nearby. This is because after a period, opponents will smarten up and not move towards the place you're targeting, and will eventually flank you.</p>    <p>This is why it's important to keep moving on any map you are dropped into, regardless of the match type. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-mobile-season-8-update-brings-new-highrise-map-juggernaut-multiplayer-mode-and-katana-operator-skill" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em></a> objective matches can sometimes have one key point that everyone converges on, but even those will change location as a match goes on. You can't stay in one location, or a few locations, for the entirety of a match. You have to keep moving and attacking enemies from different places, which can keep players guessing and make you unpredictable. Likewise, you can not only stay aware of where the fighting moves across a map, but also adapt to when things change and the winning or losing sides are switched up.</p>

<p> This is very different from rushing around the map, which is also not good. Moving around is not necessarily rushing towards your doom, especially when you're changing locations to keep enemies away from you or key objectives as you shoot at them. Some players like to run rotations around small maps, which takes advantage of spawn points and unsuspecting players that aren't aware of what's around them. This can work for a time, but it's still important to keep changing things so you don't become predictable by the enemy team. If they know you're going to run a similar route, they can adjust their moves and catch you when you're trying to be routine. Staying ahead is more about keeping aware of what is going on throughout the map, and never letting the other team take advantage of your blind spots and predicability.</p>    <h3>
Getting better at Call of Duty multiplayer
</h3>
<p>It takes time to work on and better our skills in any multiplayer game, especially when one has been playing it for a long time across multiple titles. As much as everyone may complain about how <em>Call of Duty</em> online multiplayer can be frustrating and at times unfair, many still keep coming back to it for more action. Part of the way of improving skills in a game like <em>Call of Duty</em> is being able to honestly spot the mistakes made during matches and consciously try to avoid them. Everybody, from the most seasoned players to more casual players, can make mistakes that lead to getting more losses than wins, and yet, still have the same potential to improve and get better with time. As <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-dutys-new-black-ops-7-trailer-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> arrives</a> on consoles very soon, players can hop online and take these tips to heart towards improving their game before the newest iteration of <em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer release on consoles in November 2025.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>With the release of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> coming up in November 2025, everyone will be getting ready to hop online for the game's multiplayer modes. And as many gamers know, things can get chaotic in multiplayer matches with any <em>Call of Duty</em> game. Whether you're playing team deathmatch or any objective game type, it's going to be hectic one way or another. But with the craziness of online matches going on, players are always complaining about often getting killed and having a major disadvantage. And unfortunately, some of it may be due to things they're doing wrong while spawning into matches of their favorite playlists.</p>    <p>Not every loss and terrible set up during a multiplayer match of <em>Call of Duty</em> is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-needs-to-be-harsher-against-cheating" target="_blank">due to someone cheating</a> or getting matched up with a professional clan. Sometimes you're getting killed because you're not playing well, or you're not doing something important that can help keep the advantage for your team. And it happens more often than one might realize, especially if you find the kill cam showing up more often than you would like. Here are four things everybody does wrong in <em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer matches all the time, and how to be proactive when correcting them.</p>

Wasting grenades
</h2><h3>
Throwing stuff out carelessly
</h3>

<p>Let's be totally honest, everybody finds themselves wasting grenades all the time. Whether that comes from throwing lethal or tactical grenades across the map, or just never using them at all, wasting grenades is a bad move. Most players may not even realize they're doing it too, especially when one is so focused on getting into a shooting match with other players. Grenades are a good compliment to the rest of your arsenal, but they should never be carelessly thrown when you don't need to. Not every <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer</a> map you find yourself on will be small like Nuketown or Shipment, so lobbing one in the sky won't always hit an enemy player.</p>    <p>While different <em>Call of Duty</em> games have variations on grenades, including interesting ones like the pinpoint grenade in <em>Black Ops 7</em>, they are all meant for the same key function. Flushing out or disorienting teams with their effects and explosion radius. This means grenades are ideal for throwing into tight rooms, around choke points with nearby enemies, and nearby hiding spots where you know someone is located. Carelessly wasting grenades by throwing them after spawning or never using them when they count is a surefire way to give up the advantage to the other team. A well-placed grenade at the right moment can break up skirmishes and can shift momentum back into your favor, especially if you manage to kill a few enemies in the process and gain a killstreak.</p>

<p> The best way to start using grenades <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-battlefield-6-is-doing-better-than-call-of-duty-black-ops-7" target="_blank">a lot smarter in multiplayer</a> is to hold back on using them early on. Don't use them at the start of matches, and avoid running into place where others may frequently throw grenades. Wait for moments when you might be entering a room or corridor on the map that players are flocking to, like a capture point in Domination matches, and then throw them in before entering. This will force players to react if they're being careless in the area or too slow to get away before your grenade explodes, either giving you free kills or setting you up to get some. Grenades can be a player's best friend to make big moves onto objectives or keep someone from getting a very big killstreak, so don't waste them so easily.</p>    <h2>
Rushing into firefights
</h2><h3>
Sprinting after spawning is a bad idea
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1373755208" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1373755208" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1373755208" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1373755208" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1373755208-img" data-gallery-type="">

</div>
<p>Another big issue that every <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/activision-vs-call-of-duty-cheaters" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em> player struggles</a> with is rushing into the conflict. If you spawn back on your side of the map, you might be eager to get back into the fight where you were last killed, only to find yourself dead again from a similar scenario. Being in a rush to get back at the other team is one of the easiest ways to give them free kills, especially on smaller maps where you can take so few steps before someone has you in their crosshair. And while some maps in <em>Call of Duty</em> can have bad spawning spots that lock teams in bad situations, not every map can suffer from this all the time. The opposing team may be getting quick kills because you and your teammates are not assessing the situation and rushing into the fight.</p>    <p>Smaller maps can make this a real devastating problem for teams on the losing end of a match, but larger maps can also set up trigger-happy players for failure. If you spawn on the opposite side of the map and just rush into the open area to get back to where the action is, you leave yourself open to those with long-range rifles and can end up giving them a free kill. The best way to correct this is to stop yourself before hitting the sprint button to get back out there, and instead try a different route or approach to where the fight is taking place. This can mean going in a different area of the map for a better vantage point, or using doorways and objects on the map as cover while moving around differently.</p>

<p> The benefit of this is keeping the other team from getting so many kills at a faster rate, especially when your teammates might not be helping the situation. The fewer kills you give up to the other team, the harder it is for them to get larger killstreaks and the more chances for you to turn the tide. At the same time, taking the extra moments to regroup and reassess things can give you opportunities to spot enemies that might be hiding in spots they can easily shoot players passing by. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer can be hectic</a> and constantly changing, but what you contribute to the chaos can be controlled with a cooler head by not rushing back to where you may have been killed.</p>    <h2>
Not optimizing loadouts
</h2><h3>
Gearing towards your playstyle
</h3>
<div>

<p> A key part of online multiplayer matches in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-and-modern-warfare-series-ranked" target="_blank">any <em>Call of Duty</em> game</a> is making sure you have the right equipment on hand. If you're going to be on a larger map for one game type, then it might make sense to use longer-ranged weapons with good scopes. For smaller maps, you may be able to use mid to short range weapons with perks that allow you to take advantage of the smaller area. The key takeaway is to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-2026-leaked-battle-pass" target="_blank">optimize the loadout</a> you bring into the match, and have other loadouts to pick from later if things change mid-match. But some players mistakenly don't do this often, and instead pick whatever others are using or what is quick to grab at the moment.</p>    <p>Everyone's playstyle online is different, which means that most people won't use the same weapons or perks in the same fashion. While <em>Call of Duty</em> games give the flexibility to utilize perks and equipment for opposing styles, the majority of success will come from putting together something that works best for you individually. This can come from picking weapons and attachments for them that go hand-in-hand with specific perks that enhance your approach to fighting, not giving you a random bonus that you won't take advantage of often. This is why browsing through your loadouts and tinkering with them is very important, because it will make some of the more frustrating aspects of multiplayer matches a bit more manageable. It can lead to closer games and possibly more wins rather than consecutive losses online.</p>

<p> If you're in an objective game type and don't get many kills, then having perks that cater to completing objectives and reducing killstreak costs can be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/5-playstation-franchises-that-deserve-a-themed-ps5-dualsense-controller" target="_blank">a real difference maker</a>. Or if getting kills easier is the main goal, then finding ways to use equipment that disrupt opponents can help make that easier. But when you're not changing your loadout to fit your playstyle, or just going with what is working for others all the time, you leave yourself open to becoming fodder for players who do take the moment to create better loadouts for themselves.</p>    <h2>
Being stationary and unaware
</h2><h3>
Your spot isn't as good as you think
</h3>

<p>Most people love the idea of camping in one spot and watching as players run by for them to shoot easily. They feel this can always work if they find the right spot and have to do the least amount of work in a match to win. And while camping in sections of a map can be a viable strategy, despite how much people may hate it, it's not an all-purpose solution online. Most players who camp in single areas will often find themselves killed by someone they don't see coming, either from behind or out of their view nearby. This is because after a period, opponents will smarten up and not move towards the place you're targeting, and will eventually flank you.</p>    <p>This is why it's important to keep moving on any map you are dropped into, regardless of the match type. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-mobile-season-8-update-brings-new-highrise-map-juggernaut-multiplayer-mode-and-katana-operator-skill" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em></a> objective matches can sometimes have one key point that everyone converges on, but even those will change location as a match goes on. You can't stay in one location, or a few locations, for the entirety of a match. You have to keep moving and attacking enemies from different places, which can keep players guessing and make you unpredictable. Likewise, you can not only stay aware of where the fighting moves across a map, but also adapt to when things change and the winning or losing sides are switched up.</p>

<p> This is very different from rushing around the map, which is also not good. Moving around is not necessarily rushing towards your doom, especially when you're changing locations to keep enemies away from you or key objectives as you shoot at them. Some players like to run rotations around small maps, which takes advantage of spawn points and unsuspecting players that aren't aware of what's around them. This can work for a time, but it's still important to keep changing things so you don't become predictable by the enemy team. If they know you're going to run a similar route, they can adjust their moves and catch you when you're trying to be routine. Staying ahead is more about keeping aware of what is going on throughout the map, and never letting the other team take advantage of your blind spots and predicability.</p>    <h3>
Getting better at Call of Duty multiplayer
</h3>
<p>It takes time to work on and better our skills in any multiplayer game, especially when one has been playing it for a long time across multiple titles. As much as everyone may complain about how <em>Call of Duty</em> online multiplayer can be frustrating and at times unfair, many still keep coming back to it for more action. Part of the way of improving skills in a game like <em>Call of Duty</em> is being able to honestly spot the mistakes made during matches and consciously try to avoid them. Everybody, from the most seasoned players to more casual players, can make mistakes that lead to getting more losses than wins, and yet, still have the same potential to improve and get better with time. As <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-dutys-new-black-ops-7-trailer-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> arrives</a> on consoles very soon, players can hop online and take these tips to heart towards improving their game before the newest iteration of <em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer release on consoles in November 2025.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the release of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> coming up in November 2025, everyone will be getting ready to hop online for the game's multiplayer modes. And as many gamers know, things can get chaotic in multiplayer matches with any <em>Call of Duty</em> game. Whether you're playing team deathmatch or any objective game type, it's going to be hectic one way or another. But with the craziness of online matches going on, players are always complaining about often getting killed and having a major disadvantage. And unfortunately, some of it may be due to things they're doing wrong while spawning into matches of their favorite playlists.</p>    <p>Not every loss and terrible set up during a multiplayer match of <em>Call of Duty</em> is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-needs-to-be-harsher-against-cheating" target="_blank">due to someone cheating</a> or getting matched up with a professional clan. Sometimes you're getting killed because you're not playing well, or you're not doing something important that can help keep the advantage for your team. And it happens more often than one might realize, especially if you find the kill cam showing up more often than you would like. Here are four things everybody does wrong in <em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer matches all the time, and how to be proactive when correcting them.</p>

Wasting grenades
</h2><h3>
Throwing stuff out carelessly
</h3>

<p>Let's be totally honest, everybody finds themselves wasting grenades all the time. Whether that comes from throwing lethal or tactical grenades across the map, or just never using them at all, wasting grenades is a bad move. Most players may not even realize they're doing it too, especially when one is so focused on getting into a shooting match with other players. Grenades are a good compliment to the rest of your arsenal, but they should never be carelessly thrown when you don't need to. Not every <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer</a> map you find yourself on will be small like Nuketown or Shipment, so lobbing one in the sky won't always hit an enemy player.</p>    <p>While different <em>Call of Duty</em> games have variations on grenades, including interesting ones like the pinpoint grenade in <em>Black Ops 7</em>, they are all meant for the same key function. Flushing out or disorienting teams with their effects and explosion radius. This means grenades are ideal for throwing into tight rooms, around choke points with nearby enemies, and nearby hiding spots where you know someone is located. Carelessly wasting grenades by throwing them after spawning or never using them when they count is a surefire way to give up the advantage to the other team. A well-placed grenade at the right moment can break up skirmishes and can shift momentum back into your favor, especially if you manage to kill a few enemies in the process and gain a killstreak.</p>

<p> The best way to start using grenades <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-battlefield-6-is-doing-better-than-call-of-duty-black-ops-7" target="_blank">a lot smarter in multiplayer</a> is to hold back on using them early on. Don't use them at the start of matches, and avoid running into place where others may frequently throw grenades. Wait for moments when you might be entering a room or corridor on the map that players are flocking to, like a capture point in Domination matches, and then throw them in before entering. This will force players to react if they're being careless in the area or too slow to get away before your grenade explodes, either giving you free kills or setting you up to get some. Grenades can be a player's best friend to make big moves onto objectives or keep someone from getting a very big killstreak, so don't waste them so easily.</p>    <h2>
Rushing into firefights
</h2><h3>
Sprinting after spawning is a bad idea
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1373755208" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1373755208" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1373755208" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1373755208" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1373755208-img" data-gallery-type="">

</div>
<p>Another big issue that every <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/activision-vs-call-of-duty-cheaters" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em> player struggles</a> with is rushing into the conflict. If you spawn back on your side of the map, you might be eager to get back into the fight where you were last killed, only to find yourself dead again from a similar scenario. Being in a rush to get back at the other team is one of the easiest ways to give them free kills, especially on smaller maps where you can take so few steps before someone has you in their crosshair. And while some maps in <em>Call of Duty</em> can have bad spawning spots that lock teams in bad situations, not every map can suffer from this all the time. The opposing team may be getting quick kills because you and your teammates are not assessing the situation and rushing into the fight.</p>    <p>Smaller maps can make this a real devastating problem for teams on the losing end of a match, but larger maps can also set up trigger-happy players for failure. If you spawn on the opposite side of the map and just rush into the open area to get back to where the action is, you leave yourself open to those with long-range rifles and can end up giving them a free kill. The best way to correct this is to stop yourself before hitting the sprint button to get back out there, and instead try a different route or approach to where the fight is taking place. This can mean going in a different area of the map for a better vantage point, or using doorways and objects on the map as cover while moving around differently.</p>

<p> The benefit of this is keeping the other team from getting so many kills at a faster rate, especially when your teammates might not be helping the situation. The fewer kills you give up to the other team, the harder it is for them to get larger killstreaks and the more chances for you to turn the tide. At the same time, taking the extra moments to regroup and reassess things can give you opportunities to spot enemies that might be hiding in spots they can easily shoot players passing by. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer can be hectic</a> and constantly changing, but what you contribute to the chaos can be controlled with a cooler head by not rushing back to where you may have been killed.</p>    <h2>
Not optimizing loadouts
</h2><h3>
Gearing towards your playstyle
</h3>
<div>
<div>

<p> A key part of online multiplayer matches in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-and-modern-warfare-series-ranked" target="_blank">any <em>Call of Duty</em> game</a> is making sure you have the right equipment on hand. If you're going to be on a larger map for one game type, then it might make sense to use longer-ranged weapons with good scopes. For smaller maps, you may be able to use mid to short range weapons with perks that allow you to take advantage of the smaller area. The key takeaway is to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-2026-leaked-battle-pass" target="_blank">optimize the loadout</a> you bring into the match, and have other loadouts to pick from later if things change mid-match. But some players mistakenly don't do this often, and instead pick whatever others are using or what is quick to grab at the moment.</p>    <p>Everyone's playstyle online is different, which means that most people won't use the same weapons or perks in the same fashion. While <em>Call of Duty</em> games give the flexibility to utilize perks and equipment for opposing styles, the majority of success will come from putting together something that works best for you individually. This can come from picking weapons and attachments for them that go hand-in-hand with specific perks that enhance your approach to fighting, not giving you a random bonus that you won't take advantage of often. This is why browsing through your loadouts and tinkering with them is very important, because it will make some of the more frustrating aspects of multiplayer matches a bit more manageable. It can lead to closer games and possibly more wins rather than consecutive losses online.</p>

<p> If you're in an objective game type and don't get many kills, then having perks that cater to completing objectives and reducing killstreak costs can be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/5-playstation-franchises-that-deserve-a-themed-ps5-dualsense-controller" target="_blank">a real difference maker</a>. Or if getting kills easier is the main goal, then finding ways to use equipment that disrupt opponents can help make that easier. But when you're not changing your loadout to fit your playstyle, or just going with what is working for others all the time, you leave yourself open to becoming fodder for players who do take the moment to create better loadouts for themselves.</p>    <h2>
Being stationary and unaware
</h2><h3>
Your spot isn't as good as you think
</h3>

<p>Most people love the idea of camping in one spot and watching as players run by for them to shoot easily. They feel this can always work if they find the right spot and have to do the least amount of work in a match to win. And while camping in sections of a map can be a viable strategy, despite how much people may hate it, it's not an all-purpose solution online. Most players who camp in single areas will often find themselves killed by someone they don't see coming, either from behind or out of their view nearby. This is because after a period, opponents will smarten up and not move towards the place you're targeting, and will eventually flank you.</p>    <p>This is why it's important to keep moving on any map you are dropped into, regardless of the match type. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-mobile-season-8-update-brings-new-highrise-map-juggernaut-multiplayer-mode-and-katana-operator-skill" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em></a> objective matches can sometimes have one key point that everyone converges on, but even those will change location as a match goes on. You can't stay in one location, or a few locations, for the entirety of a match. You have to keep moving and attacking enemies from different places, which can keep players guessing and make you unpredictable. Likewise, you can not only stay aware of where the fighting moves across a map, but also adapt to when things change and the winning or losing sides are switched up.</p>

<p> This is very different from rushing around the map, which is also not good. Moving around is not necessarily rushing towards your doom, especially when you're changing locations to keep enemies away from you or key objectives as you shoot at them. Some players like to run rotations around small maps, which takes advantage of spawn points and unsuspecting players that aren't aware of what's around them. This can work for a time, but it's still important to keep changing things so you don't become predictable by the enemy team. If they know you're going to run a similar route, they can adjust their moves and catch you when you're trying to be routine. Staying ahead is more about keeping aware of what is going on throughout the map, and never letting the other team take advantage of your blind spots and predicability.</p>    <h3>
Getting better at Call of Duty multiplayer
</h3>
<p>It takes time to work on and better our skills in any multiplayer game, especially when one has been playing it for a long time across multiple titles. As much as everyone may complain about how <em>Call of Duty</em> online multiplayer can be frustrating and at times unfair, many still keep coming back to it for more action. Part of the way of improving skills in a game like <em>Call of Duty</em> is being able to honestly spot the mistakes made during matches and consciously try to avoid them. Everybody, from the most seasoned players to more casual players, can make mistakes that lead to getting more losses than wins, and yet, still have the same potential to improve and get better with time. As <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-dutys-new-black-ops-7-trailer-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> arrives</a> on consoles very soon, players can hop online and take these tips to heart towards improving their game before the newest iteration of <em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer release on consoles in November 2025.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>The Raspberry Pi has become so popular that its name has become synonymous with the term "single-board computer." Numerous small-scale SBC brands also started using “Pi” in their products, further complicating the purchase decision. Non-Raspberry Pi boards offer better specifications at a slightly lower price, which is their biggest draw for anyone looking to buy their first SBC or expand their collection. I recently purchased a newly launched <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-tried-emulating-ps3-games-on-this-raspberry-pi-killer/" target="_blank">Radxa</a> board because it offered a better price-to-performance ratio; however, I didn't consider the additional challenges it entailed.</p>    <p>I struggled with the lack of proper, descriptive documentation, a limited variety of distribution to choose from, missing features, and subpar community support for building projects with it. All these problems will influence my decision when I purchase a new SBC later, and you must keep them in mind if you plan to step outside the Raspberry Pi realm.</p>    <h2>
Documentation woes
</h2><h3>
Barely exists
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Raspberry Pi OS Trixie on a display" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/these-are-my-4-favorite-changes-in-raspberry-pi-os-trixie-featured.jpeg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> After buying a single-board computer, you need support documentation to set it up. My Radxa Cubie A5E comes with a very basic website page that provides a brief description of how to set up the board. The information is so sparse that it will deter any newbie from purchasing the board, especially the newly launched ones. If I compare it with the Raspberry Pi, the gap is huge. You receive comprehensive documentation, including detailed step-by-step guides for setting it up. Even a novice can follow it and comfortably install an operating system on the Raspberry Pi.</p>    <p>I chose a recently released non-Pi board, and the lack of documentation surprised me. Radxa has an extensive lineup of good boards and competes with the Pi lineup. Given the wide range of products, I expected the documentation to be impressive. Sadly, only the popular boards receive special treatment, while the new lineup has a nearly blank webpage.</p>    <p>Their Wiki page hasn't been updated in ages — 2019, to be precise. If it weren't for GitHub or a third-party page, I couldn't even download a distro to flash onto a disk, which points to another significant problem.</p>    <h2>
Lack of distros
</h2><h3>
Limited options
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1895273667" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1895273667" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1895273667" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1895273667" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1895273667-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>I have tried several operating systems on my Raspberry Pi Zero 2W before settling on DietPi as my main operating system. My decision was influenced by DietPi's rich tools and robust documentation, but I also keep several other OS on multiple SD cards and swap them. It gives me the flexibility to switch to a gaming emulation OS or a media streaming one whenever I like.</p>    <p>The grass isn't as green on the side of the non-Raspberry Pi boards. Yes, some popular boards might offer multiple OS options, but the slightly less popular or fairly new ones don't. My Radxa Cubie A5E has only one <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/using-dietpi-linux-with-xfce-on-an-old-laptop/" target="_blank">XFCE</a> image option, which underwent multiple iterations to get things right. There’s no support for my favorite <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dietpi-guide/" target="_blank">DietPi</a> yet, and the only other supported image is Armbian. It doesn’t support the Radxa OS, which is available for the brand's more powerful boards.</p>    <p>Even some of the links didn’t work a week back, and I had to settle for a slightly older image just to boot up the board for the first time. There’s a severe lack of focused operating systems, such as mOode Audio OS, OpenWRT, and DietPi, for non-Raspberry Pi boards.</p>    <h2>
Missing features and accessories
</h2><h3>
Not all promises are true
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1066807213" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1066807213" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1066807213" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1066807213" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1066807213-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Imagine buying a board with features that rival those of a top-of-the-line Raspberry Pi board, only to find that they don't work out of the box. One of my boards had an NVMe slot available, in addition to the micro SD card slot, but it didn't work until a few months ago. After the manufacturers released a compatible OS edition, the feature became available. It's similar to the essential accessories for any project.</p>    <p>The Raspberry Pi offers numerous accessories, ranging from cases and fans to hats and more. You'll never struggle to find something useful for it, and the availability is much better. But you won't get the same options with the other brand's single-board computers. Despite having a strong spec sheet, purchasing accessories can still be a challenge. So, you'll have to resort to 3D printing some of them, like a case or a contraption for fans and expanding storage.</p>    <p>Even the main board availability isn't guaranteed, and you might have to wait for months before a seller restocks them. That's a bummer if you plan to build a cluster of the same type of boards or need a specific model.</p>    <h2>
Sparse community support
</h2><h3>
Figuring out yourself
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Orange Pi 5 Pro top-front angle" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/orange-pi-5-pro-front-angle-1.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> One thing I absolutely love about the Pi is its community, which has grown manifold in the last decade. You'll find discussions on even small issues, with people stepping up to help resolve them. I have often encountered small obstacles that prevent a self-hosted project from working, but I have always found a forum post or Reddit thread that got me out of trouble.</p>    <p>First-time SBC owners face problems at every step, and having such a vast resource of information available makes it easy to try things out. It gives you the confidence to try your hand at even complex projects because you’ll find descriptive guides, suggestions, and prompt help.</p>    <p>However, non-Raspberry Pi boards may have varying levels of community support, which works for some projects only. If you manage to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/heres-how-docker-can-simplify-your-home-server-setup/" target="_blank">run Docker on any SBC</a>, most self-hosted services will work fine, but some custom operating systems, like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-never-run-home-assistant-anything-other-dedicated-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank">Home Assistant</a>, won’t work. You’ll need to use the Docker version, which has a slightly less feature-rich set of tools.</p>    <h3>
Be prepared for challenges
</h3>
<p>Switching to a non-Raspberry Pi could be a rocky ride if you aren’t prepared for it. The first thing I do before buying a new board is to research its available operating systems, accessories, and kits. I also pay attention to long-term user feedback and don’t blindly rely on the spec sheet and price as the only useful metrics.</p>    <p>I generally avoid anything that’s been released recently because I’m not adept at hardware-level troubleshooting. If you want to opt for brands like Orange Pi or Radxa, choose a board that is fairly popular and offers rich documentation and support.</p>]]>

<p> After buying a single-board computer, you need support documentation to set it up. My Radxa Cubie A5E comes with a very basic website page that provides a brief description of how to set up the board. The information is so sparse that it will deter any newbie from purchasing the board, especially the newly launched ones. If I compare it with the Raspberry Pi, the gap is huge. You receive comprehensive documentation, including detailed step-by-step guides for setting it up. Even a novice can follow it and comfortably install an operating system on the Raspberry Pi.</p>    <p>I chose a recently released non-Pi board, and the lack of documentation surprised me. Radxa has an extensive lineup of good boards and competes with the Pi lineup. Given the wide range of products, I expected the documentation to be impressive. Sadly, only the popular boards receive special treatment, while the new lineup has a nearly blank webpage.</p>    <p>Their Wiki page hasn't been updated in ages — 2019, to be precise. If it weren't for GitHub or a third-party page, I couldn't even download a distro to flash onto a disk, which points to another significant problem.</p>    <h2>

<p>I have tried several operating systems on my Raspberry Pi Zero 2W before settling on DietPi as my main operating system. My decision was influenced by DietPi's rich tools and robust documentation, but I also keep several other OS on multiple SD cards and swap them. It gives me the flexibility to switch to a gaming emulation OS or a media streaming one whenever I like.</p>    <p>The grass isn't as green on the side of the non-Raspberry Pi boards. Yes, some popular boards might offer multiple OS options, but the slightly less popular or fairly new ones don't. My Radxa Cubie A5E has only one <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/using-dietpi-linux-with-xfce-on-an-old-laptop/" target="_blank">XFCE</a> image option, which underwent multiple iterations to get things right. There’s no support for my favorite <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dietpi-guide/" target="_blank">DietPi</a> yet, and the only other supported image is Armbian. It doesn’t support the Radxa OS, which is available for the brand's more powerful boards.</p>    <p>Even some of the links didn’t work a week back, and I had to settle for a slightly older image just to boot up the board for the first time. There’s a severe lack of focused operating systems, such as mOode Audio OS, OpenWRT, and DietPi, for non-Raspberry Pi boards.</p>    <h2>

<p>Imagine buying a board with features that rival those of a top-of-the-line Raspberry Pi board, only to find that they don't work out of the box.

You'll never struggle to find something useful for it, and the availability is much better. But you won't get the same options with the other brand's single-board computers.

<p> One thing I absolutely love about the Pi is its community, which has grown manifold in the last decade. You'll find discussions on even small issues, with people stepping up to help resolve them.

<p>Switching to a non-Raspberry Pi could be a rocky ride if you aren’t prepared for it.

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Raspberry Pi has become so popular that its name has become synonymous with the term "single-board computer." Numerous small-scale SBC brands also started using “Pi” in their products, further complicating the purchase decision. Non-Raspberry Pi boards offer better specifications at a slightly lower price, which is their biggest draw for anyone looking to buy their first SBC or expand their collection. I recently purchased a newly launched <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-tried-emulating-ps3-games-on-this-raspberry-pi-killer/" target="_blank">Radxa</a> board because it offered a better price-to-performance ratio; however, I didn't consider the additional challenges it entailed.</p>    <p>I struggled with the lack of proper, descriptive documentation, a limited variety of distribution to choose from, missing features, and subpar community support for building projects with it. All these problems will influence my decision when I purchase a new SBC later, and you must keep them in mind if you plan to step outside the Raspberry Pi realm.</p>    <h2>

<p>Before we delve into what Microsoft claims it's doing, let's first ensure we understand exactly what it's fixing. When you boot up Windows for the very first time, either because you bought a new PC or you reinstalled Windows, it shows you a series of full-screen dialogue boxes before you reach the desktop. This is the out-of-box experience (OOBE), and its primary goal is to get the user all set up before they land on the desktop.</p>    <p>Part of the OOBE requires the user to sign in to a Microsoft account, with no option to skip the step.

However, instead of simply saying that it was patching out a local account creation method, it instead took this angle:</p>    <blockquote>
<p><strong>Local-only commands removal:</strong> We are removing known mechanisms for creating a local account in the Windows Setup experience (OOBE). While these mechanisms were often used to bypass Microsoft account setup, they also inadvertently skip critical setup screens, potentially causing users to exit OOBE with a device that is not fully configured for use. Users will need to complete OOBE with internet and a Microsoft account, to ensure device is setup correctly.</p>
</blockquote><p>At first glance, this seems legitimate. However, there's one word that's doing a ton of heavy lifting here: "critical." Now, the intensity of words varies from person to person. Still, for me, when something is a "critical setup screen," it means the computer is either severely hampered or inoperable if it's skipped. Microsoft may have a different meaning for the word "critical," because nothing during the OOBE really jumps out as something that <em>needs</em> to be done for Windows 11 to operate.</p>    <p>Off the top of my head, the most "critical" part of the OOBE is when the system gets you connected to the internet. But that's something you can easily do while on the desktop, and frankly, it feels like it's added to the OOBE so that you can sign into your Microsoft account later on. The rest of the OOBE is Microsoft offering you its services, such as OneDrive and Microsoft 365, which I suppose is "critical" in the eyes of its profit margin.</p>    <p>All in all, Microsoft's reasoning doesn't seem to be trying to stop people from using a partially set-up Windows 11.

When you boot up Windows for the very first time, either because you bought a new PC or you reinstalled Windows, it shows you a series of full-screen dialogue boxes before you reach the desktop. This is the out-of-box experience (OOBE), and its primary goal is to get the user all set up before they land on the desktop.</p>    <p>Part of the OOBE requires the user to sign in to a Microsoft account, with no option to skip the step. In response, people found a way to open the Command Prompt while in the OOBE and enter a command that would skip the entire process. This meant that the essential Microsoft sign-in screen was thrown aside, allowing people to sign in with a local account exclusively.</p>    <h2>
Microsoft's explanation for the loophole closure doesn't quite hold water
</h2><h3>
I'm not sure how "critical" the OOBE experience truly is

<p>In the latest <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/10/06/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26220-6772-dev-channel/" target="_blank">Windows 11 patch for Insiders</a>, the company stated that it was going to fix this method. However, instead of simply saying that it was patching out a local account creation method, it instead took this angle:</p>    <blockquote>
<p><strong>Local-only commands removal:</strong> We are removing known mechanisms for creating a local account in the Windows Setup experience (OOBE). While these mechanisms were often used to bypass Microsoft account setup, they also inadvertently skip critical setup screens, potentially causing users to exit OOBE with a device that is not fully configured for use. Users will need to complete OOBE with internet and a Microsoft account, to ensure device is setup correctly.</p>
</blockquote><p>At first glance, this seems legitimate. However, there's one word that's doing a ton of heavy lifting here: "critical." Now, the intensity of words varies from person to person. Still, for me, when something is a "critical setup screen," it means the computer is either severely hampered or inoperable if it's skipped. Microsoft may have a different meaning for the word "critical," because nothing during the OOBE really jumps out as something that <em>needs</em> to be done for Windows 11 to operate.</p>    <p>Off the top of my head, the most "critical" part of the OOBE is when the system gets you connected to the internet. But that's something you can easily do while on the desktop, and frankly, it feels like it's added to the OOBE so that you can sign into your Microsoft account later on. The rest of the OOBE is Microsoft offering you its services, such as OneDrive and Microsoft 365, which I suppose is "critical" in the eyes of its profit margin.</p>    <p>All in all, Microsoft's reasoning doesn't seem to be trying to stop people from using a partially set-up Windows 11. Instead, it really feels more like it just wants people to use Microsoft accounts, as there are <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/5-reasons-microsoft-doesnt-like-local-accounts/" target="_blank">several reasons why Microsoft would want them to do so</a>.</p>    <h3>
Microsoft's battle versus local accounts continues
</h3>
<p>While Microsoft claims that its latest changes to the OOBE experience ensure that people don't "inadvertently skip critical setup screens," the truth is far more likely that the company just doesn't want us making local accounts. And as people continue to find ways to make them, we'll likely see more patches arrive to fix them.</p>]]></content:encoded>
