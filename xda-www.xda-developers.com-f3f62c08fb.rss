      <![CDATA[<p>It's a good day if you're into puzzle games. A little while ago, I reported that Chants of Sannaar, which holds a spot in my pantheon of "favorite puzzle games ever," was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/my-favorite-puzzle-games-ever-40-off-steam/" target="_blank">discounted as part of a Steam sale</a>. Now, <em>another</em> one from that pantheon, Return of the Obra Dinn, has just gone on sale. It's <span>as if someone at Valve has both a love for puzzle games <em>and</em> impeccable</span> taste.</p>    <h2>
Return of the Obra Dinn is 50% off on Steam right now
</h2>
<p>Return of the Obra Dinn follows your average detective-style gameplay. People have died, and you need to figure out how they were taken out and who did the deed, if anyone. However, there's a catch: all the deaths happened five years ago, and all that remains are the skeletons of the crew and some scraps.</p>    <p>Fortunately, you have a watch that allows you to see the exact moment when someone died, as if it were a freeze frame. From here, you can see who attacked whom, who was skulking in the shadows, and even further clues into the fate of the crew.</p>    <p>Once you figure it out, you log the cause of death and the attacker, if any, in your book. Once you've gotten a trio of the crew correct, the game will lock them in. Your objective is to get your entire book filled out so you can file your findings to an insurance company.</p>    <p>Here's the Steam page listing:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>In 1802, the merchant ship <em>Obra Dinn</em> set out from London for the Orient with over 200 tons of trade goods. Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea.</p>
<p>Early this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port at Falmouth with damaged sails and no visible crew. As insurance investigator for the East India Company's London Office, dispatch immediately to Falmouth, find means to board the ship, and prepare an assessment of damages.</p>
<p><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> is a first-person mystery adventure based on exploration and logical deduction.</p>
</blockquote><p>Right now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/" target="_blank">Return of the Obra Dinn is 50% off on Steam</a> until October 23rd, selling for a very reasonable $10. It's the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/653530/" target="_blank">lowest the game has ever been on Steam</a>, beating its previous 40% discount record. And if you need more convincing, we named it <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/indie-games-play-least-once-your-life/" target="_blank">one of the best indie games that everyone should play once in their lives</a>.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's a good day if you're into puzzle games. A little while ago, I reported that Chants of Sannaar, which holds a spot in my pantheon of "favorite puzzle games ever," was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/my-favorite-puzzle-games-ever-40-off-steam/" target="_blank">discounted as part of a Steam sale</a>. Now, <em>another</em> one from that pantheon, Return of the Obra Dinn, has just gone on sale. It's <span>as if someone at Valve has both a love for puzzle games <em>and</em> impeccable</span> taste.</p>    <h2>
Return of the Obra Dinn is 50% off on Steam right now
</h2>
<p>Return of the Obra Dinn follows your average detective-style gameplay. People have died, and you need to figure out how they were taken out and who did the deed, if anyone. However, there's a catch: all the deaths happened five years ago, and all that remains are the skeletons of the crew and some scraps.</p>    <p>Fortunately, you have a watch that allows you to see the exact moment when someone died, as if it were a freeze frame. From here, you can see who attacked whom, who was skulking in the shadows, and even further clues into the fate of the crew.</p>    <p>Once you figure it out, you log the cause of death and the attacker, if any, in your book. Once you've gotten a trio of the crew correct, the game will lock them in. Your objective is to get your entire book filled out so you can file your findings to an insurance company.</p>    <p>Here's the Steam page listing:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>In 1802, the merchant ship <em>Obra Dinn</em> set out from London for the Orient with over 200 tons of trade goods. Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea.</p>
<p>Early this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port at Falmouth with damaged sails and no visible crew. As insurance investigator for the East India Company's London Office, dispatch immediately to Falmouth, find means to board the ship, and prepare an assessment of damages.</p>
<p><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> is a first-person mystery adventure based on exploration and logical deduction.</p>
</blockquote><p>Right now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/" target="_blank">Return of the Obra Dinn is 50% off on Steam</a> until October 23rd, selling for a very reasonable $10. It's the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/653530/" target="_blank">lowest the game has ever been on Steam</a>, beating its previous 40% discount record. And if you need more convincing, we named it <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/indie-games-play-least-once-your-life/" target="_blank">one of the best indie games that everyone should play once in their lives</a>.</p>

    <itunes:title><![CDATA[How I combined Rocketbook and Obsidian to automate my physical note-taking]]></itunes:title>
    <itunes:author><![CDATA[XDA[RSS+]]]></itunes:author>
    <itunes:summary>
      <![CDATA[<p>I'm old-school and take most of my notes by hand, but I hate re-typing them into a note-taking app later. Thankfully, I've stumbled across a solution that not only handles most of the tedium for me but also saves me a lot of money on paper: a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tech-products-under-100-back-to-school/" target="_blank">combination of Rocketbook </a>and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/finally-started-using-obsidian-should-have-sooner/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>. I take my notes in Rocketbook, a reusable notebook with a FriXion pen that can easily be erased. When I scan the page, it's automatically uploaded <span>to my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/using-icloud-on-windows-doesnt-need-to-be-a-nightmare/" target="_blank">iCloud drive</a> and then to</span> Obsidian. There are other ways of doing this — in fact, setting up the entire system in Google Drive would likely be easier — but since I already use iCloud as a backup solution, this slots into my day-to-day workflow much more easily.</p>    <p>The setup process is a bit of a pain. It's not too complicated, but there are more steps than there need to be for something like this. Don't worry, though; all you iOS users in the same boat as me will find an easy solution to a problem that really should have already been solved with an Obsidian plugin. Seriously: why isn't there better Rocketbook integration already?</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>The root of this entire problem lies in iCloud. It creates a dedicated subfolder named after any third-party app, which makes access tricky. As a result of this, rather than syncing Rocketbook uploads directly into my Obsidian folder, I have to use an automation to move uploads.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><h2>
How to automatically transfer Rocketbook files into Obsidian
</h2><p>Due to iCloud's eccentricities with third-party applications, there are two main folders that come into play here. The first is the Rocketbook folder, created by the Rocketbook app itself. The second is my Obsidian folder, which contains multiple subfolders — one for each of my vaults. In this particular circumstance, I need the files from the Rocketbook folder to move into the correct Obsidian vault subfolder. Sounds complicated, right? It could be worse. I'd rate this setup as medium difficulty, so let's get started.</p>    <h3>
Set up the correct Rocketbook destination
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Open <strong>Rocketbook</strong> on your <strong>iOS</strong> device.
</li>
<li>
Tap <strong>Destinations</strong> in the bottom-right corner.
</li>
<li>
By default, the destination will be <strong>Email</strong>. Tap <strong>Change Destination</strong> -<strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>iCloud</strong> -<strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Create New Folder</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Name the folder.
</li>
<li>
Tap <strong>Save</strong> in the upper-right corner.

Search your actions again for <strong>Move </strong><strong>File</strong>. It will automatically populate the initial field with <strong>Get Contents of Folder</strong>, but you will need to tap <strong>Shortcuts</strong>, the default selection, and instead choose the folder for your Obsidian vault.

As long as I scan the notes with the Rocketbook app — a process that takes seconds — then they're preserved in a digital format for posterity. And when it comes to notes I don't need to keep, like calculations or random scribbles? I can easily erase those, and deletion is as simple as tapping an icon if one does accidentally get uploaded.</p>

How to automatically transfer Rocketbook files into Obsidian
</h2><p>Due to iCloud's eccentricities with third-party applications, there are two main folders that come into play here. The first is the Rocketbook folder, created by the Rocketbook app itself. The second is my Obsidian folder, which contains multiple subfolders — one for each of my vaults. In this particular circumstance, I need the files from the Rocketbook folder to move into the correct Obsidian vault subfolder. Sounds complicated, right? It could be worse. I'd rate this setup as medium difficulty, so let's get started.</p>    <h3>

Open <strong>Rocketbook</strong> on your <strong>iOS</strong> device.

<li>
By default, the destination will be <strong>Email</strong>. Tap <strong>Change Destination</strong> -<strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>iCloud</strong> -<strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Create New Folder</strong>.

<li>
Name the folder.

Search for <strong>Get Contents of Folder</strong> and tap the light-blue <strong>Folder</strong> text beneath it, then select the <strong>Rocketbook folder</strong> you named earlier.
</li>
<li>
Search your actions again for <strong>Move </strong><strong>File</strong>. It will automatically populate the initial field with <strong>Get Contents of Folder</strong>, but you will need to tap <strong>Shortcuts</strong>, the default selection, and instead choose the folder for your Obsidian vault. In my case, I have a dedicated folder for Rocketbook uploads, but you can choose to send the files to your primary vault instead.

<p>And with that, voilà: any file you upload to Rocketbook will automatically appear in your Obsidian vault as soon as you close the application. The reason I have it set to activate upon closing is that it allows me to move multiple notes at once.</p>    <h2>
It's convenient, and it saves the trees
</h2><p>As I said earlier, I take a lot of notes — but I always felt bad jotting things down that would be tossed later. It felt like a waste of paper. With the Rocketbook, I can take as many notes as I want and simply clean the page off later with a damp cloth. As long as I scan the notes with the Rocketbook app — a process that takes seconds — then they're preserved in a digital format for posterity. And when it comes to notes I don't need to keep, like calculations or random scribbles? I can easily erase those, and deletion is as simple as tapping an icon if one does accidentally get uploaded.</p>

<p> Integrated graphics can run many basic tasks for your PC, freeing up GPU resources. Integrated Graphics can display web pages, handle video playback, and control office applications. Essentially, the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-use-integrated-graphics-instead-of-gpu/" target="_blank">iGPU can run your PC</a> whenever you don't require the extra resources provided by your discrete graphics card.</p>    <p>So, unless you're in a game, editing videos, or doing some 3D rendering, your PC can run certain tasks using the iGPU. And if you've got multiple monitors or multiple programs open, you can dedicate your discrete GPU resources to your game while the iGPU keeps your Discord or streaming window operational.</p>    <p>Most motherboards only allow you to output from one GPU at a time, but the actual processing (not the rasterization and output) can still be done on the iGPU in the background. You can look for a setting along the lines of "iGPU Multi-Monitor" in your motherboard which will allow you to actually output using both the motherboard and your GPU's output ports.</p>    <p>The uses for an iGPU are even more obvious when thinking about it in a home server context. Chances are, the iGPU of your processor is more than enough to handle video transcoding, so you can transcode video at high resolution through technology like Intel QuickSync, without needing to spin up and power your discrete GPU.</p>    <h2>

<p>Not only can an iGPU handle a number of general-use tasks and even some light gaming, it's a far more power-efficient option compared to a discrete GPU.</p>    <p>While power efficiency is less important on a desktop than on a laptop, you don't always want your 300-500-watt GPU kicking on just because you need to check your email or want to play a YouTube video for background noise. While a discrete gaming GPU isn't likely to run at full power while just browsing the web, it still draws more power than the iGPU.</p>    <p>This is highly dependent on your graphics card, but a discrete GPU can idle from anywhere as low as 10W of power to 30W, though an iGPU will typically idle lower than 10W. Over time, those power savings will build up, especially if you use your gaming PC for work, school, or general web surfing and social media binges.</p>    <p>Modern laptops will seamlessly switch between integrated and discrete graphics depending on the workload in order to save battery power, and on a desktop, swapping between the iGPU and discrete GPU can save you some cash on your next power bill.

<p>Another reason to keep your integrated graphics card is that it can serve as a backup GPU. Just in case something goes sideways with your discrete card, you can still use your PC and even get some gaming in on the integrated graphics card while you diagnose and solve the issue with your discrete card, or wait for a replacement to show up in the mail.</p>    <p>This is especially helpful if you don't have an old GPU lying around, or if you've <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ways-to-repurpose-old-components/" target="_blank">repurposed it</a> for a home server or eGPU.

<p>It's difficult to buy a CPU that doesn't have an integrated graphics tile built in at this point. Both AMD and Intel desktop and laptop CPUs feature integrated graphics alongside the main compute unit, though AMD has been dropping CPUs for the AM5 platform without integrated graphics, and Intel's 'F' line of CPUs lack integrated graphics, too. With that said, it's worth trying to actually use your iGPU, particularly when it's still useful to run additional chat or streaming monitors, can save you money on your power bill, and can function as a backup GPU in case your RTX 5090 decided to set itself on fire.</p>    <p>Whether you use your iGPU to power multiple monitors, as a backup for a discrete GPU failure, or to save power, there are multiple uses for integrated graphics. And these uses don't have to replace your discrete GPU, but work flawlessly alongside it.

      <![CDATA[<p>It's that time of the year again. Wallets are tighter, game wishlists are longer, and both <em>Battlefield </em>and <em>Call of Duty </em>have arrived at the worst possible time for anyone trying to budget responsibly. Between dinners, parties, and holiday gifts, buying two big AAA shooters back-to-back isn't something all players would be able to do. In fact, it's an important buying decision for the entire friend group, who are going to be spending their available time with the squad on one game instead of constantly hopping between two.</p>    <p>If you've been staring at both <em>Battlefield 6 </em>and the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-will-outsell-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">upcoming </a><em><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-will-outsell-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> </em>on your wishlist, and wondering which one deserves your money, this breakdown's for you. Sure, both games are heavyweights and <em>Battlefield</em> has never looked so good, but they still cater to <em>very </em>different kinds of players.</p>    <h2>
In sheer content, Call of Duty offers more
</h2><h3>
Even if Black Ops 7's campaign turns out to be a dud, the multiplayer is just as slick
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-164008749" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-164008749" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-164008749" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-164008749" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-164008749-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Let's start with the cold, hard value proposition. <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> offers more bang for your buck right out of the gate. It's packing three major experiences — a full campaign, a Zombies mode with multiple maps, including the largest-ever Zombies map, and its multiplayer mode. We don't know a lot about <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-will-disappoint-single-player-gamers/" target="_blank"><em>Black Ops 7</em>'s co-op campaign</a>, but the other two are both robust enough to stand on their own. That's a lot of content for one purchase, and if you're the kind of player who loves switching things up, it's hard to ignore that versatility.</p>    <p>On the other hand, <em>Battlefield 6</em> sticks to the franchise's bread and butter: a short single-player campaign and its sprawling multiplayer. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-review/" target="_blank">the campaign this time around is a letdown</a>. It's flashy and loud, yes, but it's also a complete misfire narratively, and from a gameplay perspective as well. Thankfully, the multiplayer more than makes up for it, because that's where <em>Battlefield </em>always shines. There's also the <a href="https://gamerant.com/battlefield-6-bf6-portal-good-custom-sandbox-modes/" target="_blank">Battlefield Portal</a>, which lets you play community-created maps, <em>some</em> of which are rather incredible.</p>    <p>So, in essence, <em>Black Ops 7</em> gives you more modes, but <em>Battlefield 6</em> gives you one truly great experience, which is its massive-scale warfare. Even if the <em>Black Ops 7</em> campaign is a dud, the <em>COD </em>game will have one entire mode over Battlefield to offer its players. Plus, the Endgame for the campaign will be replayable, and even if you somehow manage to like the <em>Battlefield 6</em> campaign, you won't be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/most-replayable-games-i-will-never-get-tired-of-playing/" target="_blank">going back to play it regularly</a>, or even frequently.</p>    <h2>
Both games offer different multiplayer experiences
</h2><h3>
It's chaos versus curation in the MP lobbies
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1349776313" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1349776313" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1349776313" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1349776313" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1349776313-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s multiplayer is a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-online-open-beta-good-but-has-problems/" target="_blank">strong return to form</a>, harkening back to <em>Battlefield 3</em> and <em>4</em>-era multiplayer gameplay with no performance issues. It's all-out chaos, and that's why people love it. It's huge, unpredictable, and built for "Only in <em>Battlefield</em>" moments of emergent madness that you simply can't script. You'll have Abram tanks rolling through villages, jets dogfighting in the sky, snipers on distant rooftops, and a dozen things exploding all at once while you look for the nearest trench to throw yourself into. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/all-game-modes-in-battlefield-6-ranked/" target="_blank">The scale of the multiplayer maps</a> here is nothing like <em>Call of Duty </em>offers players, and that is the game's greatest strength. It gives you the feeling of being part of something much larger than yourself.</p>    <p>On the flip side, <em>Black Ops 7</em> offers the kind of tight, curated experience that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer/" target="_blank">only <em>COD </em>can deliver</a>. The maps may be smaller, but every inch is polished and intentional. There's a rhythm to every firefight, and you can practically feel the designers' fingerprints in the sightlines, choke points, and cover placements. Of course, movement remains <em>the </em>signature of <em>COD</em>. In <em>Black Ops 7</em>, it's smoother than ever. Wall jumps, slides, and quick turns all flow together seamlessly, creating a fast-paced dance of reflexes that feels as buttery as it looks.</p>    <p>Where you'll get true immersion and scale in <em>Battlefield </em>to the point that you won't even be able to explore a full map without playing two or three matches,<em> Call of Duty</em> is about precision and intensity, and the new multiplayer maps are absolutely worth the time you'll spend grinding in them. They're tighter, the teams are smaller, and the gunplay is a lot faster.</p>    <h2>
SBMM vs. persistent lobbies is the biggest differentiator
</h2><h3>
Has Activision removed SBMM out of fear of Battlefield 6?
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-2375920" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-2375920" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-2375920" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-2375920" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-2375920-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>This is a big one. <em>Battlefield 6</em> does have SBMM (skill-based matchmaking), meaning your matches are constantly reshuffled to put you against players of roughly-equal skill. It's a fair system, yes, but it can make multiplayer feel oddly sterile.</p>    <p><em>Black Ops 7</em>, however, is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-xbox-360-multiplayer-shooters/" target="_blank">going old-school</a>. Developer Treyarch have announced that the game, at launch, will have persistent lobbies and no SBMM, which is something that <em>COD </em>players have been requesting.</p>    <p>This means you'll stay in the same match lobby between games, creating natural rivalries and that old-school sense of community over hours of playtime that we've missed <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/first-person-shooter-games-from-2000s-that-disappeared/" target="_blank">since the Xbox 360 days</a>. It's the kind of change that hardcore fans have been begging for, and it could make <em>BO7</em>'s multiplayer far more social than Battlefield's.</p>    <h2>
Do you like your war simulator light-hearted?
</h2><h3>
Battlefield 6 has assured players it won't be chasing trends
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-4-1968860180" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-4-1968860180" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-4-1968860180" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-4-1968860180" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-4-1968860180-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Both studios have made it clear that they are doubling down on what defines their respective series. <em>Battlefield 6 </em>refuses to chase trends. There aren't going to be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/stop-crying-about-celebrity-skins-fortnite/" target="_blank">celebrity skins</a>, pop-culture crossovers, or memes here. What you'll get is just grounded, gritty warfare. In fact, the studio even poked fun at <em>Call of Duty</em>'s celebrity crossovers with one of their pre-launch trailers, which was a confident statement: "We know what we are."</p>    <p>Meanwhile, <em>Call of Duty </em>is playing a balancing act. The bevy of celebrity skins and even cartoons in the <em>Black Ops 6 </em>multiplayer from last year <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-2026-leaked-battle-pass/" target="_blank">left a bad taste</a> in the mouths of a major part of the player base, and after listening to their complaints, they stated <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" target="_blank">in a community post</a> that <em>Black Ops 7 </em>won't be carrying <em>Black Ops 6</em>'s skins into its multiplayer. Its battle royale mode, Warzone, which is a standalone gameplay experience now, will continue to be the playground for all the pop-culture madness, but <em>Black Ops 7 </em>will still leave room for some wacky crossovers that the higher-ups convince themselves fit into the theme.</p>    <p>If you want a no-nonsense, boots-on-the-ground combat game that refuses to bow to trends, <em>Battlefield 6 </em>should be your pick. If you want the best of both worlds, where you get fast and fluid gameplay along with modern flair and a wall jumping mechanic, <em>BO7 </em>might have you covered instead.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, both games are going to be bought for their multiplayer, and they deliver exactly what they've promised. They just do so for very different kinds of players.</p>    <p>If you want massive maps, vehicular warfare, slower and tactical gameplay, and a grounded, realistic tone, <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-battlefield-6-is-doing-better-than-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" target="_blank">the game you should be buying</a> now. It will also give you a community that thrives on teamwork, where each game will require genuine teamwork and class distribution.</p>    <p>If that doesn't sound like the kind of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-first-person-shooters-free-play-steam/" target="_blank">first-person shooter</a> you want to play, you might want to hold off on that $70 expenditure and instead get <em>Black Ops 7 </em>when it comes out on November 14. It'll give you more content for your money, lightning-fast movement and much tighter maps, and a vibrant online scene with persistent lobbies. This is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-and-modern-warfare-series-ranked/" target="_blank">quintessential <em>Call of Duty</em></a>, polished to perfection.</p>

<h3>
You get to decide what kind of soldier you want to be
</h3>
<p>If you're short on time or money and can only pick one this holiday, the smarter move might be to hold off until <em>Black Ops 7 </em>drops. You'll have more content and a revitalized multiplayer system. Still, if you want a taste of next-gen warfare right now with zero delay, along with explosions echoing across massive maps and the chaos of real battlefields, then <em>Battlefield 6</em> will more than satisfy you.</p>]]>

    <description>
      <![CDATA[<p>It's that time of the year again. Wallets are tighter, game wishlists are longer, and both <em>Battlefield </em>and <em>Call of Duty </em>have arrived at the worst possible time for anyone trying to budget responsibly. Between dinners, parties, and holiday gifts, buying two big AAA shooters back-to-back isn't something all players would be able to do. In fact, it's an important buying decision for the entire friend group, who are going to be spending their available time with the squad on one game instead of constantly hopping between two.</p>    <p>If you've been staring at both <em>Battlefield 6 </em>and the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-will-outsell-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">upcoming </a><em><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-will-outsell-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> </em>on your wishlist, and wondering which one deserves your money, this breakdown's for you. Sure, both games are heavyweights and <em>Battlefield</em> has never looked so good, but they still cater to <em>very </em>different kinds of players.</p>    <h2>
In sheer content, Call of Duty offers more
</h2><h3>
Even if Black Ops 7's campaign turns out to be a dud, the multiplayer is just as slick
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-164008749" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-164008749" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-164008749" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-164008749" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-164008749-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Let's start with the cold, hard value proposition. <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> offers more bang for your buck right out of the gate. It's packing three major experiences — a full campaign, a Zombies mode with multiple maps, including the largest-ever Zombies map, and its multiplayer mode. We don't know a lot about <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-will-disappoint-single-player-gamers/" target="_blank"><em>Black Ops 7</em>'s co-op campaign</a>, but the other two are both robust enough to stand on their own. That's a lot of content for one purchase, and if you're the kind of player who loves switching things up, it's hard to ignore that versatility.</p>    <p>On the other hand, <em>Battlefield 6</em> sticks to the franchise's bread and butter: a short single-player campaign and its sprawling multiplayer. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-review/" target="_blank">the campaign this time around is a letdown</a>. It's flashy and loud, yes, but it's also a complete misfire narratively, and from a gameplay perspective as well. Thankfully, the multiplayer more than makes up for it, because that's where <em>Battlefield </em>always shines. There's also the <a href="https://gamerant.com/battlefield-6-bf6-portal-good-custom-sandbox-modes/" target="_blank">Battlefield Portal</a>, which lets you play community-created maps, <em>some</em> of which are rather incredible.</p>    <p>So, in essence, <em>Black Ops 7</em> gives you more modes, but <em>Battlefield 6</em> gives you one truly great experience, which is its massive-scale warfare. Even if the <em>Black Ops 7</em> campaign is a dud, the <em>COD </em>game will have one entire mode over Battlefield to offer its players. Plus, the Endgame for the campaign will be replayable, and even if you somehow manage to like the <em>Battlefield 6</em> campaign, you won't be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/most-replayable-games-i-will-never-get-tired-of-playing/" target="_blank">going back to play it regularly</a>, or even frequently.</p>    <h2>
Both games offer different multiplayer experiences
</h2><h3>
It's chaos versus curation in the MP lobbies
</h3>

<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1349776313" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1349776313" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1349776313" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1349776313" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1349776313-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s multiplayer is a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-online-open-beta-good-but-has-problems/" target="_blank">strong return to form</a>, harkening back to <em>Battlefield 3</em> and <em>4</em>-era multiplayer gameplay with no performance issues. It's all-out chaos, and that's why people love it. It's huge, unpredictable, and built for "Only in <em>Battlefield</em>" moments of emergent madness that you simply can't script. You'll have Abram tanks rolling through villages, jets dogfighting in the sky, snipers on distant rooftops, and a dozen things exploding all at once while you look for the nearest trench to throw yourself into. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/all-game-modes-in-battlefield-6-ranked/" target="_blank">The scale of the multiplayer maps</a> here is nothing like <em>Call of Duty </em>offers players, and that is the game's greatest strength. It gives you the feeling of being part of something much larger than yourself.</p>    <p>On the flip side, <em>Black Ops 7</em> offers the kind of tight, curated experience that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer/" target="_blank">only <em>COD </em>can deliver</a>. The maps may be smaller, but every inch is polished and intentional. There's a rhythm to every firefight, and you can practically feel the designers' fingerprints in the sightlines, choke points, and cover placements. Of course, movement remains <em>the </em>signature of <em>COD</em>. In <em>Black Ops 7</em>, it's smoother than ever. Wall jumps, slides, and quick turns all flow together seamlessly, creating a fast-paced dance of reflexes that feels as buttery as it looks.</p>    <p>Where you'll get true immersion and scale in <em>Battlefield </em>to the point that you won't even be able to explore a full map without playing two or three matches,<em> Call of Duty</em> is about precision and intensity, and the new multiplayer maps are absolutely worth the time you'll spend grinding in them. They're tighter, the teams are smaller, and the gunplay is a lot faster.</p>    <h2>
SBMM vs. persistent lobbies is the biggest differentiator
</h2><h3>
Has Activision removed SBMM out of fear of Battlefield 6?
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-2375920" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-2375920" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-2375920" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-2375920" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-2375920-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>This is a big one. <em>Battlefield 6</em> does have SBMM (skill-based matchmaking), meaning your matches are constantly reshuffled to put you against players of roughly-equal skill. It's a fair system, yes, but it can make multiplayer feel oddly sterile.</p>    <p><em>Black Ops 7</em>, however, is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-xbox-360-multiplayer-shooters/" target="_blank">going old-school</a>. Developer Treyarch have announced that the game, at launch, will have persistent lobbies and no SBMM, which is something that <em>COD </em>players have been requesting.</p>    <p>This means you'll stay in the same match lobby between games, creating natural rivalries and that old-school sense of community over hours of playtime that we've missed <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/first-person-shooter-games-from-2000s-that-disappeared/" target="_blank">since the Xbox 360 days</a>. It's the kind of change that hardcore fans have been begging for, and it could make <em>BO7</em>'s multiplayer far more social than Battlefield's.</p>    <h2>
Do you like your war simulator light-hearted?
</h2><h3>
Battlefield 6 has assured players it won't be chasing trends
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-4-1968860180" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-4-1968860180" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-4-1968860180" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-4-1968860180" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-4-1968860180-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Both studios have made it clear that they are doubling down on what defines their respective series. <em>Battlefield 6 </em>refuses to chase trends. There aren't going to be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/stop-crying-about-celebrity-skins-fortnite/" target="_blank">celebrity skins</a>, pop-culture crossovers, or memes here. What you'll get is just grounded, gritty warfare. In fact, the studio even poked fun at <em>Call of Duty</em>'s celebrity crossovers with one of their pre-launch trailers, which was a confident statement: "We know what we are."</p>    <p>Meanwhile, <em>Call of Duty </em>is playing a balancing act. The bevy of celebrity skins and even cartoons in the <em>Black Ops 6 </em>multiplayer from last year <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-2026-leaked-battle-pass/" target="_blank">left a bad taste</a> in the mouths of a major part of the player base, and after listening to their complaints, they stated <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" target="_blank">in a community post</a> that <em>Black Ops 7 </em>won't be carrying <em>Black Ops 6</em>'s skins into its multiplayer. Its battle royale mode, Warzone, which is a standalone gameplay experience now, will continue to be the playground for all the pop-culture madness, but <em>Black Ops 7 </em>will still leave room for some wacky crossovers that the higher-ups convince themselves fit into the theme.</p>    <p>If you want a no-nonsense, boots-on-the-ground combat game that refuses to bow to trends, <em>Battlefield 6 </em>should be your pick. If you want the best of both worlds, where you get fast and fluid gameplay along with modern flair and a wall jumping mechanic, <em>BO7 </em>might have you covered instead.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, both games are going to be bought for their multiplayer, and they deliver exactly what they've promised. They just do so for very different kinds of players.</p>    <p>If you want massive maps, vehicular warfare, slower and tactical gameplay, and a grounded, realistic tone, <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-battlefield-6-is-doing-better-than-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" target="_blank">the game you should be buying</a> now. It will also give you a community that thrives on teamwork, where each game will require genuine teamwork and class distribution.</p>    <p>If that doesn't sound like the kind of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-first-person-shooters-free-play-steam/" target="_blank">first-person shooter</a> you want to play, you might want to hold off on that $70 expenditure and instead get <em>Black Ops 7 </em>when it comes out on November 14. It'll give you more content for your money, lightning-fast movement and much tighter maps, and a vibrant online scene with persistent lobbies. This is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-and-modern-warfare-series-ranked/" target="_blank">quintessential <em>Call of Duty</em></a>, polished to perfection.</p>

<h3>
You get to decide what kind of soldier you want to be
</h3>
<p>If you're short on time or money and can only pick one this holiday, the smarter move might be to hold off until <em>Black Ops 7 </em>drops. You'll have more content and a revitalized multiplayer system. Still, if you want a taste of next-gen warfare right now with zero delay, along with explosions echoing across massive maps and the chaos of real battlefields, then <em>Battlefield 6</em> will more than satisfy you.</p>]]>
    </description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's that time of the year again. Wallets are tighter, game wishlists are longer, and both <em>Battlefield </em>and <em>Call of Duty </em>have arrived at the worst possible time for anyone trying to budget responsibly. Between dinners, parties, and holiday gifts, buying two big AAA shooters back-to-back isn't something all players would be able to do. In fact, it's an important buying decision for the entire friend group, who are going to be spending their available time with the squad on one game instead of constantly hopping between two.</p>    <p>If you've been staring at both <em>Battlefield 6 </em>and the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-will-outsell-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">upcoming </a><em><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-will-outsell-battlefield-6/" target="_blank">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> </em>on your wishlist, and wondering which one deserves your money, this breakdown's for you. Sure, both games are heavyweights and <em>Battlefield</em> has never looked so good, but they still cater to <em>very </em>different kinds of players.</p>    <h2>
In sheer content, Call of Duty offers more
</h2><h3>
Even if Black Ops 7's campaign turns out to be a dud, the multiplayer is just as slick
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-164008749" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-164008749" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-164008749" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-164008749" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-164008749-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Let's start with the cold, hard value proposition. <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> offers more bang for your buck right out of the gate. It's packing three major experiences — a full campaign, a Zombies mode with multiple maps, including the largest-ever Zombies map, and its multiplayer mode. We don't know a lot about <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-will-disappoint-single-player-gamers/" target="_blank"><em>Black Ops 7</em>'s co-op campaign</a>, but the other two are both robust enough to stand on their own. That's a lot of content for one purchase, and if you're the kind of player who loves switching things up, it's hard to ignore that versatility.</p>    <p>On the other hand, <em>Battlefield 6</em> sticks to the franchise's bread and butter: a short single-player campaign and its sprawling multiplayer. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-review/" target="_blank">the campaign this time around is a letdown</a>. It's flashy and loud, yes, but it's also a complete misfire narratively, and from a gameplay perspective as well. Thankfully, the multiplayer more than makes up for it, because that's where <em>Battlefield </em>always shines. There's also the <a href="https://gamerant.com/battlefield-6-bf6-portal-good-custom-sandbox-modes/" target="_blank">Battlefield Portal</a>, which lets you play community-created maps, <em>some</em> of which are rather incredible.</p>    <p>So, in essence, <em>Black Ops 7</em> gives you more modes, but <em>Battlefield 6</em> gives you one truly great experience, which is its massive-scale warfare. Even if the <em>Black Ops 7</em> campaign is a dud, the <em>COD </em>game will have one entire mode over Battlefield to offer its players. Plus, the Endgame for the campaign will be replayable, and even if you somehow manage to like the <em>Battlefield 6</em> campaign, you won't be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/most-replayable-games-i-will-never-get-tired-of-playing/" target="_blank">going back to play it regularly</a>, or even frequently.</p>    <h2>
Both games offer different multiplayer experiences
</h2><h3>
It's chaos versus curation in the MP lobbies
</h3>

<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1349776313" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1349776313" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1349776313" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1349776313" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1349776313-img" data-gallery-type="">

</div>
<p><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s multiplayer is a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/battlefield-6-online-open-beta-good-but-has-problems/" target="_blank">strong return to form</a>, harkening back to <em>Battlefield 3</em> and <em>4</em>-era multiplayer gameplay with no performance issues. It's all-out chaos, and that's why people love it. It's huge, unpredictable, and built for "Only in <em>Battlefield</em>" moments of emergent madness that you simply can't script. You'll have Abram tanks rolling through villages, jets dogfighting in the sky, snipers on distant rooftops, and a dozen things exploding all at once while you look for the nearest trench to throw yourself into. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/all-game-modes-in-battlefield-6-ranked/" target="_blank">The scale of the multiplayer maps</a> here is nothing like <em>Call of Duty </em>offers players, and that is the game's greatest strength. It gives you the feeling of being part of something much larger than yourself.</p>    <p>On the flip side, <em>Black Ops 7</em> offers the kind of tight, curated experience that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-need-to-change-call-of-duty-multiplayer-just-keep-us-playing-for-longer/" target="_blank">only <em>COD </em>can deliver</a>. The maps may be smaller, but every inch is polished and intentional. There's a rhythm to every firefight, and you can practically feel the designers' fingerprints in the sightlines, choke points, and cover placements. Of course, movement remains <em>the </em>signature of <em>COD</em>. In <em>Black Ops 7</em>, it's smoother than ever. Wall jumps, slides, and quick turns all flow together seamlessly, creating a fast-paced dance of reflexes that feels as buttery as it looks.</p>    <p>Where you'll get true immersion and scale in <em>Battlefield </em>to the point that you won't even be able to explore a full map without playing two or three matches,<em> Call of Duty</em> is about precision and intensity, and the new multiplayer maps are absolutely worth the time you'll spend grinding in them. They're tighter, the teams are smaller, and the gunplay is a lot faster.</p>    <h2>
SBMM vs. persistent lobbies is the biggest differentiator
</h2><h3>
Has Activision removed SBMM out of fear of Battlefield 6?
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-2375920" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-2375920" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-2375920" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-2375920" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-2375920-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>This is a big one. <em>Battlefield 6</em> does have SBMM (skill-based matchmaking), meaning your matches are constantly reshuffled to put you against players of roughly-equal skill. It's a fair system, yes, but it can make multiplayer feel oddly sterile.</p>    <p><em>Black Ops 7</em>, however, is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-xbox-360-multiplayer-shooters/" target="_blank">going old-school</a>. Developer Treyarch have announced that the game, at launch, will have persistent lobbies and no SBMM, which is something that <em>COD </em>players have been requesting.</p>    <p>This means you'll stay in the same match lobby between games, creating natural rivalries and that old-school sense of community over hours of playtime that we've missed <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/first-person-shooter-games-from-2000s-that-disappeared/" target="_blank">since the Xbox 360 days</a>. It's the kind of change that hardcore fans have been begging for, and it could make <em>BO7</em>'s multiplayer far more social than Battlefield's.</p>    <h2>
Do you like your war simulator light-hearted?
</h2><h3>
Battlefield 6 has assured players it won't be chasing trends
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-4-1968860180" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-4-1968860180" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-4-1968860180" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-4-1968860180" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-4-1968860180-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Both studios have made it clear that they are doubling down on what defines their respective series. <em>Battlefield 6 </em>refuses to chase trends. There aren't going to be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/stop-crying-about-celebrity-skins-fortnite/" target="_blank">celebrity skins</a>, pop-culture crossovers, or memes here. What you'll get is just grounded, gritty warfare. In fact, the studio even poked fun at <em>Call of Duty</em>'s celebrity crossovers with one of their pre-launch trailers, which was a confident statement: "We know what we are."</p>    <p>Meanwhile, <em>Call of Duty </em>is playing a balancing act. The bevy of celebrity skins and even cartoons in the <em>Black Ops 6 </em>multiplayer from last year <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-2026-leaked-battle-pass/" target="_blank">left a bad taste</a> in the mouths of a major part of the player base, and after listening to their complaints, they stated <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" target="_blank">in a community post</a> that <em>Black Ops 7 </em>won't be carrying <em>Black Ops 6</em>'s skins into its multiplayer. Its battle royale mode, Warzone, which is a standalone gameplay experience now, will continue to be the playground for all the pop-culture madness, but <em>Black Ops 7 </em>will still leave room for some wacky crossovers that the higher-ups convince themselves fit into the theme.</p>    <p>If you want a no-nonsense, boots-on-the-ground combat game that refuses to bow to trends, <em>Battlefield 6 </em>should be your pick. If you want the best of both worlds, where you get fast and fluid gameplay along with modern flair and a wall jumping mechanic, <em>BO7 </em>might have you covered instead.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, both games are going to be bought for their multiplayer, and they deliver exactly what they've promised. They just do so for very different kinds of players.</p>    <p>If you want massive maps, vehicular warfare, slower and tactical gameplay, and a grounded, realistic tone, <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-battlefield-6-is-doing-better-than-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" target="_blank">the game you should be buying</a> now. It will also give you a community that thrives on teamwork, where each game will require genuine teamwork and class distribution.</p>    <p>If that doesn't sound like the kind of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-first-person-shooters-free-play-steam/" target="_blank">first-person shooter</a> you want to play, you might want to hold off on that $70 expenditure and instead get <em>Black Ops 7 </em>when it comes out on November 14. It'll give you more content for your money, lightning-fast movement and much tighter maps, and a vibrant online scene with persistent lobbies. This is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-and-modern-warfare-series-ranked/" target="_blank">quintessential <em>Call of Duty</em></a>, polished to perfection.</p>

<h3>
You get to decide what kind of soldier you want to be
</h3>
<p>If you're short on time or money and can only pick one this holiday, the smarter move might be to hold off until <em>Black Ops 7 </em>drops. You'll have more content and a revitalized multiplayer system. Still, if you want a taste of next-gen warfare right now with zero delay, along with explosions echoing across massive maps and the chaos of real battlefields, then <em>Battlefield 6</em> will more than satisfy you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>I initially got into the home lab rabbit hole because of my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-wish-knew-before-setting-up-nas/" target="_blank">Network-Attached Storage</a> rig, but I’ve since moved on to dedicated virtualization platforms for server experiments.

I also self-host a handful of services inside the NAS, including apps that help manage my smart home devices.</p>    <p>For example, I’ve ditched the third-party companion apps of security cameras and switched to Frigate as my Network Video Recorder tool. Like other self-hosted services, there are plenty of ways to deploy Frigate, and I could easily go down the ol' Docker container route. However, I refuse to host it on anything besides my NAS rig.</p>    <h2>

<p>Starting with Frigate itself, my surveillance setup is a mixed bag of IP cameras that I’ve bought during sales over the years. In addition to their clunky and restrictive companion apps, managing my security cameras from different interfaces would be a test of patience. Leaving aside the fact that they’re from different brands, I’d still have to invest in a dedicated NVR device to access centralized management, object detection, motion tracking, and other security features.</p>    <p>But since I already have a custom-built storage server, I can just deploy Frigate on it and save my wallet from the extra costs. Compared to the likes of ZoneMinder, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/self-host-frigate-on-nas/" target="_blank">Frigate</a> is light enough to run on mere SBCs, so it works well on my NAS. Frigate also has a pretty sleek UI and includes powerful machine-learning NVR features that can use the GTX 1080 I’ve installed in the NAS.</p>    <h2>
No more share permissions to deal with

</div>
<p>If you’re wondering why I keep highlighting my NAS as the hosting machine for Frigate, it’s because NVR tools can generate a lot of video footage in a few weeks. Had I tried running it on, say, my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/proxmox-guide/" target="_blank">Proxmox</a> node (I’ve tried to do this with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/proxmox-surveillance-system/" target="_blank">ZoneMinder in the past</a>), I’d have to slot an extra hard drive just to hoard the footage from all the cameras. And no, I refuse to configure NFS shares to connect the Frigate instance with NFS-based shares may deliver solid performance, but their permissions are a complete nightmare to manage – and I say that as someone who has spent many weekends pulling my hair out trying to troubleshoot authentication errors. SMB shares are much better in that regard, but I often work with unprivileged containers. Sure, it’s possible to mount network volumes to these secure containers using a handful of workarounds.</p>    <p>But considering that the Frigate container will end up saving all the footage to my NAS if I went down the network share route, it’s a lot easier to just deploy the NVR on the storage server and call it a day. Rather than dealing with the scourge of NFS permissions, all I had to do was select a dataset within my preferred storage pool before pairing my Frigate instance with my security cameras.</p>    <h2>

<p>Home labs are experimental by their very nature, and trial-and-error is a normal aspect of tinkering with server projects. Between regular backups and excessive documentation, I have enough ways to recover my home lab if things go wrong. But even if I can restore the main server node after a botched experiment, I’d still have to spend some time waiting for the virtual guests to come back to life. That’s a problem for a security-oriented service like Frigate, which not only helps me manage my self-hosted app stack, but also scans the camera feed for suspicious activity.</p>    <p>Since I’ve got backups scheduled round the clock for server nodes, daily drivers, and family devices, my NAS remains operational all day. I’ve also spared it from wacky experiments, as I don’t want my precious data to become irrecoverable. This makes my NAS the perfect host machine for Frigate, and I don’t have to worry about the surveillance system going offline due to my tinkering shenanigans.</p>    <h3>

<p>I love TrueNAS for multiple reasons, and its solid app store is one of them. Rather than deploying Frigate as a Docker container inside a VM, I’ve used the NVR tool’s app on TrueNAS to deploy it. Better yet, the Frigate image on TrueNAS can be configured using a variety of menu-based settings and toggles instead of long YAML scripts. Combine the lack of reliance on network shares with the simple setup procedure on TrueNAS’ app store, and you can get Frigate up and running even if you don’t have any prior experience with Docker containers.</p>]]>

<p>There are a lot of things you can add to your desk setup, but a docking station is going to be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/laptop-docking-station-best-upgrade-home-office/" target="_blank">one of our favorite options</a>, expanding the capabilities of your devices with new ways to connect. And while we've seen plenty of different docking stations go on sale, this 20-in-1 from iVANKY is a sure winner thanks to its steep $100 discount.</p>    <h2>

<p>When it comes to a device like this, it's going to be all about the ports. Luckily, the FusionDock Pro 2 delivers in this respect, featuring 20 ports to expand whatever devices you're going to be plugging in. On the front of the device, you're going to get three USB-A, two USB-C, an SD and microSD card slot, along with a 3.5mm audio jack.</p>    <p>On the rear, you'll get an Ethernet port, three HDMI, two DisplayPort, along with three USB-A, and two USB-C ports. There's also a DC port that will supply up to 180W of power to the devices connected. The docking station will offer compatibility with Apple, Windows, and other types of devices.</p>    <p>You'll be able to output to multiple monitors from one device, or connect multiple devices to one docking station to keep things better organized.

      <![CDATA[<p>If you own a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/steam-deck-review/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a> but you don't want to be limited to playing games on Steam, there's a good chance you've heard about the Heroic Games Launcher. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-app-lets-me-play-non-steam-games-steam-deck/" target="_blank">We've covered it ourselves</a> a few years back as a great way to bring Epic Games titles such as <em>Fortnite</em> to the Steam Deck.</p>    <p>But as great as Heroic is on Valve's handheld, that's not the end of its perks. This game launcher is also a great addition to your PC, and it can help reduce clutter and organize your games that much better. Let's take a look at why.</p>    <h2>
It's on all platforms
</h2><h3>
Yes, even macOS
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-988920154" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-988920154" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-988920154" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-988920154" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-988920154-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The Steam Deck runs SteamOS, which is a Linux-based operating system largely based on Arch, but the thing about Heroic is that it's hardly limited to any one platform. The launcher is available for Arch-based Linux distros, yes, but it's also available for the vast majority of Linux <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/this-is-by-far-the-best-linux-package-manager/" target="_blank">package managers</a> so you can play your games on any machine of your choosing.</p>    <p>And it's not just for Linux, either. It's also available on macOS and Windows. On macOS, you can still benefit <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-running-windows-apps-linux-with-wine-but-virtualization-still-better/" target="_blank">from Wine</a> to allow you to run a lot of Windows games on a Mac. You don't get all the benefits of Proton, which is exclusive to Linux, but it's still a big deal for anyone wanting to try PC gaming despite being stuck with a Mac.</p>    <p>Ultimately, that's still the biggest benefit of Heroic. On Windows, all games run natively, but Heroic makes it easy to bring a lot of these games to Linux and macOS through Proton and Wine. Plus, if any of those games also have a native build for that operating system, Heroic can also download the appropriate build to ensure you have the best experience. In fact, you can even choose the version of Wine, Proton (on Linux), or even Apple's Game Porting Toolkit (on macOS) to use with each game to ensure the best compatibility possible</p>    <h2>
All your games in one place
</h2><h3>
It's just more organized
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Heroic Games Launcher showing a library of games from different platforms" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/heroic-games-launcher-library.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>It used to be that Steam held a near monopoly on PC gaming, but over time, companies have stepped up to the plate with storefronts of their own, focusing on more specific benefits. Epic Games has built a reputation for itself by giving away free games on a regular basis, and a platform like GOG is popular for offering DRM-free games and also making a lot of classic games available and functional on modern hardware.</p>    <p>The problem with this is that it can become hard to manage your games when you're keeping a Steam library, a library for Epic Games titles, and another one for GOG, or even things like the EA App or Ubisoft Connect. All of those separate apps mean you have more hoops to jump through to get to your games, and that's something Heroic Games Launcher addresses, and does so on all platforms.</p>    <p>Out of the box, Heroic Games Launcher integrates with both the Epic Games Store and GOG, so you can buy games and browse your library from both platforms within the same app. It also lets you sign into Amazon Prime Gaming, but I don't find this all too useful considering most games there are redeemed on the Epic Games Store and GOG anyway. It's just about access to the storefront, but in my experience, it often fails to sign me in, so I'd just ignore that part.</p>    <p>Still, bringing those two platforms together is already a big plus, and if you're a Windows user, you can make it even better. You can add games from the EA App and Ubisoft Connect to your Heroic library, too, though it's a bit different here. With these apps, you still need the official launcher installed, you just have the option to view your games inside Heroic and use it to launch the official app and then the game itself. Still, it's a benefit for organization and makes things a lot easier.</p>    <p>You can take this even further, too. Heroic has an option for automatically games from your Heroic library to Steam, so if you want to keep everything in a single unified UI, you have that option. It's especially great if you want to use your PC in a home theater setup in Big Picture Mode, so you can access your games more easily with a controller.</p>    <h2>
Save space
</h2><h3>
The fewer apps, the better
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Epic Games launcher, Ubisoft Connect Launcher, and GOG Galaxy on Windows 11" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/game-launchers-on-windows-11.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Having a unified interface for all your games is great to keep things more organized, but there's another benefit to it, too, and that's saving resources. Game launchers aren't really meant to be using much in the way of resources in the background, but if you have Steam, Epic Games, and GOG Galaxy all running in the background, that's probably more than you want.</p>    <p>Maybe more importantly, having a single app can also save space on your computer. These launchers often take hundreds of megabytes of space, and while that's not a lot by today's standards, it's still eating into your hard drive, and having more free space is never a bad thing.</p>    <p>Heroic is a relatively lightweight app in itself, and since it replaces two others, it does make things a little bit nicer.</p>    <h2>
There are even some little extras
</h2><h3>
Helping you choose your next game
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Heroic Games Launcher showing aggregate review scores and length information on Amnesia: Rebirth" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/heroic-games-launcher-extra-info.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>The core benefits of Heroic Games Launcher already make it a fantastic addition to any gaming PC, but I also like that there some extra little things in this launcher. You can click on any of your games to see easily glanceable</p>    <p>information about the version you have installed, system requirements, and even some internet info on critic reviews, and data from HowLongToBeat.</p>    <p>Any PC gamer knows how easy it is to pile up <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/games-to-go-back-to-2025/" target="_blank">games in your library</a> that you're probably never going to play, especially because of some of the huge sales these titles get and the frequent giveaways on places like Epic Games. Being able to easily see the critical reception to games in your library, as well as how long they might take you to beat, can greatly help you choose what to play next.</p>    <p>It's just a nice bow on what's already a great package, and if you have any doubts that Heroic Games Launcher is a great match for your gaming PC, let me be the one to tell you that it is. It makes things a whole lot easier for you, and I highly recommend it.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you own a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/steam-deck-review/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a> but you don't want to be limited to playing games on Steam, there's a good chance you've heard about the Heroic Games Launcher. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-app-lets-me-play-non-steam-games-steam-deck/" target="_blank">We've covered it ourselves</a> a few years back as a great way to bring Epic Games titles such as <em>Fortnite</em> to the Steam Deck.</p>    <p>But as great as Heroic is on Valve's handheld, that's not the end of its perks. This game launcher is also a great addition to your PC, and it can help reduce clutter and organize your games that much better. Let's take a look at why.</p>    <h2>
It's on all platforms
</h2><h3>
Yes, even macOS
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-988920154" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-988920154" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-988920154" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-988920154" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-988920154-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The Steam Deck runs SteamOS, which is a Linux-based operating system largely based on Arch, but the thing about Heroic is that it's hardly limited to any one platform. The launcher is available for Arch-based Linux distros, yes, but it's also available for the vast majority of Linux <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/this-is-by-far-the-best-linux-package-manager/" target="_blank">package managers</a> so you can play your games on any machine of your choosing.</p>    <p>And it's not just for Linux, either. It's also available on macOS and Windows. On macOS, you can still benefit <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-running-windows-apps-linux-with-wine-but-virtualization-still-better/" target="_blank">from Wine</a> to allow you to run a lot of Windows games on a Mac. You don't get all the benefits of Proton, which is exclusive to Linux, but it's still a big deal for anyone wanting to try PC gaming despite being stuck with a Mac.</p>    <p>Ultimately, that's still the biggest benefit of Heroic. On Windows, all games run natively, but Heroic makes it easy to bring a lot of these games to Linux and macOS through Proton and Wine. Plus, if any of those games also have a native build for that operating system, Heroic can also download the appropriate build to ensure you have the best experience. In fact, you can even choose the version of Wine, Proton (on Linux), or even Apple's Game Porting Toolkit (on macOS) to use with each game to ensure the best compatibility possible</p>    <h2>
All your games in one place
</h2><h3>
It's just more organized
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Heroic Games Launcher showing a library of games from different platforms" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/heroic-games-launcher-library.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>It used to be that Steam held a near monopoly on PC gaming, but over time, companies have stepped up to the plate with storefronts of their own, focusing on more specific benefits. Epic Games has built a reputation for itself by giving away free games on a regular basis, and a platform like GOG is popular for offering DRM-free games and also making a lot of classic games available and functional on modern hardware.</p>    <p>The problem with this is that it can become hard to manage your games when you're keeping a Steam library, a library for Epic Games titles, and another one for GOG, or even things like the EA App or Ubisoft Connect. All of those separate apps mean you have more hoops to jump through to get to your games, and that's something Heroic Games Launcher addresses, and does so on all platforms.</p>    <p>Out of the box, Heroic Games Launcher integrates with both the Epic Games Store and GOG, so you can buy games and browse your library from both platforms within the same app. It also lets you sign into Amazon Prime Gaming, but I don't find this all too useful considering most games there are redeemed on the Epic Games Store and GOG anyway. It's just about access to the storefront, but in my experience, it often fails to sign me in, so I'd just ignore that part.</p>    <p>Still, bringing those two platforms together is already a big plus, and if you're a Windows user, you can make it even better. You can add games from the EA App and Ubisoft Connect to your Heroic library, too, though it's a bit different here. With these apps, you still need the official launcher installed, you just have the option to view your games inside Heroic and use it to launch the official app and then the game itself. Still, it's a benefit for organization and makes things a lot easier.</p>    <p>You can take this even further, too. Heroic has an option for automatically games from your Heroic library to Steam, so if you want to keep everything in a single unified UI, you have that option. It's especially great if you want to use your PC in a home theater setup in Big Picture Mode, so you can access your games more easily with a controller.</p>    <h2>
Save space
</h2><h3>
The fewer apps, the better
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Epic Games launcher, Ubisoft Connect Launcher, and GOG Galaxy on Windows 11" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/game-launchers-on-windows-11.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Having a unified interface for all your games is great to keep things more organized, but there's another benefit to it, too, and that's saving resources. Game launchers aren't really meant to be using much in the way of resources in the background, but if you have Steam, Epic Games, and GOG Galaxy all running in the background, that's probably more than you want.</p>    <p>Maybe more importantly, having a single app can also save space on your computer. These launchers often take hundreds of megabytes of space, and while that's not a lot by today's standards, it's still eating into your hard drive, and having more free space is never a bad thing.</p>    <p>Heroic is a relatively lightweight app in itself, and since it replaces two others, it does make things a little bit nicer.</p>    <h2>
There are even some little extras
</h2><h3>
Helping you choose your next game
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Heroic Games Launcher showing aggregate review scores and length information on Amnesia: Rebirth" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/heroic-games-launcher-extra-info.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>The core benefits of Heroic Games Launcher already make it a fantastic addition to any gaming PC, but I also like that there some extra little things in this launcher. You can click on any of your games to see easily glanceable</p>    <p>information about the version you have installed, system requirements, and even some internet info on critic reviews, and data from HowLongToBeat.</p>    <p>Any PC gamer knows how easy it is to pile up <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/games-to-go-back-to-2025/" target="_blank">games in your library</a> that you're probably never going to play, especially because of some of the huge sales these titles get and the frequent giveaways on places like Epic Games. Being able to easily see the critical reception to games in your library, as well as how long they might take you to beat, can greatly help you choose what to play next.</p>    <p>It's just a nice bow on what's already a great package, and if you have any doubts that Heroic Games Launcher is a great match for your gaming PC, let me be the one to tell you that it is. It makes things a whole lot easier for you, and I highly recommend it.</p>

The flexibility and simplicity make it one of the best open-source tools for anyone running Raspberry Pi OS or another Linux-based distribution on their Pi.</p>    <h2>
Block unwanted ads and trackers with Pi-hole
</h2><h3>
A self-hosted DNS sinkhole that improves network privacy
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Pi-hole with LCARS theme" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/07/pi-hole-with-lcars-theme.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dont-make-the-same-mistake-did-self-hosting-pi-hole/" target="_blank">Pi-hole has become a household name</a> for Raspberry Pi enthusiasts, and for good reason. It acts as a local DNS filter, blocking ad servers and tracking domains for every device on your network. Once you set it up, you’ll notice websites loading faster and your devices consuming less data. It’s a set-it-and-forget-it tool that improves both privacy and performance.</p>    <p>The web dashboard gives you detailed insight into how your network communicates. You can see which domains are being requested, which were blocked, and which devices are the busiest. This visibility can be addictive for anyone who enjoys understanding their network’s behavior. It’s also helpful for identifying rogue devices or apps that constantly phone home.</p>    <p>Pi-hole works excellently as a standalone tool, but it’s even better when paired with Unbound for encrypted, recursive DNS resolution. This combination creates a secure and private setup where your Raspberry Pi becomes your own DNS authority. Few open-source tools deliver such tangible benefits with so little ongoing maintenance.</p>    <h2>
Simplify container management with Portainer
</h2><h3>
A user-friendly interface for Docker and self-hosted apps

<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1948854697" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1948854697" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1948854697" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1948854697" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1948854697-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>If you’re running Docker on your Raspberry Pi, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/portainer-guide/" target="_blank">Portainer is almost essential</a>. It’s an open-source tool that provides a visual dashboard for managing containers, images, networks, and volumes. Instead of typing out complex <code>docker</code> commands, you can spin up or tear down applications with a few clicks.</p>    <p>This tool shines when you’re experimenting with self-hosted apps. From deploying Nextcloud to managing Uptime Kuma, Portainer keeps your projects organized. It makes troubleshooting containers that won’t start or pulling images directly from Docker Hub easier. The lightweight design means it runs flawlessly even on a Pi 4 or Zero 2 W.</p>    <p>Portainer is also a great learning aid. If you’re still getting comfortable with Docker concepts, the interface provides visual feedback on what’s happening under the hood. Once you understand it, you can transition back to the command line or continue using the web dashboard for convenience. Either way, it’s a must-have for any modern Raspberry Pi setup.</p>    <h2>
Automate your environment with Home Assistant
</h2><h3>
A powerful automation platform for your smart devices
</h3>
<div>
<div>

<p> On a traditional, mutable Linux operating system, the base system files are writable. Everything goes; you and your apps can change anything at will, giving an incredible amount of flexibility, but it also can mean your system feels fragile. Updates can conflict, dependencies can clash, and things can be easily overwritten and lost forever.</p>    <p>An immutable operating system is essentially the opposite. The base system files are persistent, read-only, and are isolated meaning you're limited in the changes you can make. Much of the damage you could do on a normal distro is completely mitigated by this approach, but you can still install applications and use the system as you normally would.</p>    <h2>
A big safety net is important

Seemingly innocuous changes can result in a broken system

<p> One of the biggest hurdles for new Linux users is the fear of breaking something, and on most distros, that fear is 100% justified. I can't tell you how many times I've edited the wrong configuration file, tried to uninstall a package I didn't fully understand, and ended up breaking something.</p>    <p>Immutable distros largely eliminate that problem. Because the core system is read-only, you can’t accidentally corrupt it. If something goes wrong with an update, you just reboot and roll back to the previous state, which is known as an "atomic" design. For a newcomer learning Linux, that kind of safety net is super important, and will definitely come in handy.</p>    <h2>

<p>For the experienced Linux user, keeping up with updates, installing applications, and fixing conflicts can seem like business as usual, but for someone coming from Windows or macOS, that burden can be a little too much to bear. They expect to install something and have it work regardless of what other changes they may make on their system, and thankfully, immutable distros handle that burden for you.</p>    <p>With a package manager like Flatpak, you can ensure any dependencies your favorite applications need are installed and kept separate from everything else on your system. All applications are self-contained, and you don't need to worry about one app update breaking another.</p>    <p>That consistency also makes online help far more reliable. If you’re running Bazzite 42, your base system is identical to everyone else’s using that version.
