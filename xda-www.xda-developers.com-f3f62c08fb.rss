      <![CDATA[<p>If you own a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/steam-deck-review/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a> but you don't want to be limited to playing games on Steam, there's a good chance you've heard about the Heroic Games Launcher. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-app-lets-me-play-non-steam-games-steam-deck/" target="_blank">We've covered it ourselves</a> a few years back as a great way to bring Epic Games titles such as <em>Fortnite</em> to the Steam Deck.</p>    <p>But as great as Heroic is on Valve's handheld, that's not the end of its perks. This game launcher is also a great addition to your PC, and it can help reduce clutter and organize your games that much better. Let's take a look at why.</p>    <h2>
It's on all platforms
</h2><h3>
Yes, even macOS
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-988920154" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-988920154" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-988920154" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-988920154" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-988920154-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The Steam Deck runs SteamOS, which is a Linux-based operating system largely based on Arch, but the thing about Heroic is that it's hardly limited to any one platform. The launcher is available for Arch-based Linux distros, yes, but it's also available for the vast majority of Linux <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/this-is-by-far-the-best-linux-package-manager/" target="_blank">package managers</a> so you can play your games on any machine of your choosing.</p>    <p>And it's not just for Linux, either. It's also available on macOS and Windows. On macOS, you can still benefit <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-running-windows-apps-linux-with-wine-but-virtualization-still-better/" target="_blank">from Wine</a> to allow you to run a lot of Windows games on a Mac. You don't get all the benefits of Proton, which is exclusive to Linux, but it's still a big deal for anyone wanting to try PC gaming despite being stuck with a Mac.</p>    <p>Ultimately, that's still the biggest benefit of Heroic. On Windows, all games run natively, but Heroic makes it easy to bring a lot of these games to Linux and macOS through Proton and Wine. Plus, if any of those games also have a native build for that operating system, Heroic can also download the appropriate build to ensure you have the best experience. In fact, you can even choose the version of Wine, Proton (on Linux), or even Apple's Game Porting Toolkit (on macOS) to use with each game to ensure the best compatibility possible</p>    <h2>
All your games in one place
</h2><h3>
It's just more organized
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Heroic Games Launcher showing a library of games from different platforms" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/heroic-games-launcher-library.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>It used to be that Steam held a near monopoly on PC gaming, but over time, companies have stepped up to the plate with storefronts of their own, focusing on more specific benefits. Epic Games has built a reputation for itself by giving away free games on a regular basis, and a platform like GOG is popular for offering DRM-free games and also making a lot of classic games available and functional on modern hardware.</p>    <p>The problem with this is that it can become hard to manage your games when you're keeping a Steam library, a library for Epic Games titles, and another one for GOG, or even things like the EA App or Ubisoft Connect. All of those separate apps mean you have more hoops to jump through to get to your games, and that's something Heroic Games Launcher addresses, and does so on all platforms.</p>    <p>Out of the box, Heroic Games Launcher integrates with both the Epic Games Store and GOG, so you can buy games and browse your library from both platforms within the same app. It also lets you sign into Amazon Prime Gaming, but I don't find this all too useful considering most games there are redeemed on the Epic Games Store and GOG anyway. It's just about access to the storefront, but in my experience, it often fails to sign me in, so I'd just ignore that part.</p>    <p>Still, bringing those two platforms together is already a big plus, and if you're a Windows user, you can make it even better. You can add games from the EA App and Ubisoft Connect to your Heroic library, too, though it's a bit different here. With these apps, you still need the official launcher installed, you just have the option to view your games inside Heroic and use it to launch the official app and then the game itself. Still, it's a benefit for organization and makes things a lot easier.</p>    <p>You can take this even further, too. Heroic has an option for automatically games from your Heroic library to Steam, so if you want to keep everything in a single unified UI, you have that option. It's especially great if you want to use your PC in a home theater setup in Big Picture Mode, so you can access your games more easily with a controller.</p>    <h2>
Save space
</h2><h3>
The fewer apps, the better
</h3>
<div>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p>Having a unified interface for all your games is great to keep things more organized, but there's another benefit to it, too, and that's saving resources. Game launchers aren't really meant to be using much in the way of resources in the background, but if you have Steam, Epic Games, and GOG Galaxy all running in the background, that's probably more than you want.</p>    <p>Maybe more importantly, having a single app can also save space on your computer. These launchers often take hundreds of megabytes of space, and while that's not a lot by today's standards, it's still eating into your hard drive, and having more free space is never a bad thing.</p>    <p>Heroic is a relatively lightweight app in itself, and since it replaces two others, it does make things a little bit nicer.</p>    <h2>
There are even some little extras
</h2><h3>
Helping you choose your next game

</div>
</div>
<p>The core benefits of Heroic Games Launcher already make it a fantastic addition to any gaming PC, but I also like that there some extra little things in this launcher. You can click on any of your games to see easily glanceable</p>    <p>information about the version you have installed, system requirements, and even some internet info on critic reviews, and data from HowLongToBeat.</p>    <p>Any PC gamer knows how easy it is to pile up <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/games-to-go-back-to-2025/" target="_blank">games in your library</a> that you're probably never going to play, especially because of some of the huge sales these titles get and the frequent giveaways on places like Epic Games. Being able to easily see the critical reception to games in your library, as well as how long they might take you to beat, can greatly help you choose what to play next.</p>    <p>It's just a nice bow on what's already a great package, and if you have any doubts that Heroic Games Launcher is a great match for your gaming PC, let me be the one to tell you that it is. It makes things a whole lot easier for you, and I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>The core benefits of Heroic Games Launcher already make it a fantastic addition to any gaming PC, but I also like that there some extra little things in this launcher. You can click on any of your games to see easily glanceable</p>    <p>information about the version you have installed, system requirements, and even some internet info on critic reviews, and data from HowLongToBeat.</p>    <p>Any PC gamer knows how easy it is to pile up <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/games-to-go-back-to-2025/" target="_blank">games in your library</a> that you're probably never going to play, especially because of some of the huge sales these titles get and the frequent giveaways on places like Epic Games. Being able to easily see the critical reception to games in your library, as well as how long they might take you to beat, can greatly help you choose what to play next.</p>    <p>It's just a nice bow on what's already a great package, and if you have any doubts that Heroic Games Launcher is a great match for your gaming PC, let me be the one to tell you that it is. It makes things a whole lot easier for you, and I highly recommend it.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>The Raspberry Pi is already one of the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dust-collecting-devices-that-a-raspberry-pi-can-revive/" target="_blank">most versatile small computers</a> around, but open-source software is what truly unlocks its potential. With the right tools, you can turn it into a dashboard, server, automation hub, or even a robust monitoring system. Whether you use your <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/revive-old-laptop-with-raspberry-pi-desktop-os/" target="_blank">Pi for home projects</a>, learning, or self-hosting, these tools can significantly enhance its capabilities.</p>    <h2>
Manage your Pi from anywhere with Cockpit

<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/cockpit-to-manage-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank">Cockpit turns your Raspberry Pi</a> into a fully manageable server with a clean web interface. Once installed, it provides control over users, storage, networking, and services without requiring you to constantly type commands. You can even monitor CPU and memory usage in real time. For users who are comfortable with Linux but prefer a visual way to manage systems, Cockpit bridges the gap nicely.</p>    <p>It’s beneficial when you’re running multiple SBCs or Linux devices around your home. Instead of SSHing into each one, you can open a browser tab and handle updates or check logs from a central dashboard. This makes it ideal for both beginners and advanced users who value efficiency and productivity. You can even manage other machines remotely, making Cockpit an excellent foundation for a home lab.</p>    <p>Because it’s modular, you can extend Cockpit with additional panels. There are plugins for managing virtual machines, containers, storage, and networking tools. The flexibility and simplicity make it one of the best open-source tools for anyone running Raspberry Pi OS or another Linux-based distribution on their Pi.</p>    <h2>

<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dont-make-the-same-mistake-did-self-hosting-pi-hole/" target="_blank">Pi-hole has become a household name</a> for Raspberry Pi enthusiasts, and for good reason. It acts as a local DNS filter, blocking ad servers and tracking domains for every device on your network. Once you set it up, you’ll notice websites loading faster and your devices consuming less data. It’s a set-it-and-forget-it tool that improves both privacy and performance.</p>    <p>The web dashboard gives you detailed insight into how your network communicates. You can see which domains are being requested, which were blocked, and which devices are the busiest. This visibility can be addictive for anyone who enjoys understanding their network’s behavior. It’s also helpful for identifying rogue devices or apps that constantly phone home.</p>    <p>Pi-hole works excellently as a standalone tool, but it’s even better when paired with Unbound for encrypted, recursive DNS resolution. This combination creates a secure and private setup where your Raspberry Pi becomes your own DNS authority. Few open-source tools deliver such tangible benefits with so little ongoing maintenance.</p>    <h2>

<p>If you’re running Docker on your Raspberry Pi, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/portainer-guide/" target="_blank">Portainer is almost essential</a>. It’s an open-source tool that provides a visual dashboard for managing containers, images, networks, and volumes. Instead of typing out complex <code>docker</code> commands, you can spin up or tear down applications with a few clicks.</p>    <p>This tool shines when you’re experimenting with self-hosted apps. From deploying Nextcloud to managing Uptime Kuma, Portainer keeps your projects organized. It makes troubleshooting containers that won’t start or pulling images directly from Docker Hub easier. The lightweight design means it runs flawlessly even on a Pi 4 or Zero 2 W.</p>    <p>Portainer is also a great learning aid. If you’re still getting comfortable with Docker concepts, the interface provides visual feedback on what’s happening under the hood. Once you understand it, you can transition back to the command line or continue using the web dashboard for convenience. Either way, it’s a must-have for any modern Raspberry Pi setup.</p>    <h2>

<div>
<img alt="Pi-hole with LCARS theme" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/07/pi-hole-with-lcars-theme.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dont-make-the-same-mistake-did-self-hosting-pi-hole/" target="_blank">Pi-hole has become a household name</a> for Raspberry Pi enthusiasts, and for good reason. It acts as a local DNS filter, blocking ad servers and tracking domains for every device on your network. Once you set it up, you’ll notice websites loading faster and your devices consuming less data. It’s a set-it-and-forget-it tool that improves both privacy and performance.</p>    <p>The web dashboard gives you detailed insight into how your network communicates. You can see which domains are being requested, which were blocked, and which devices are the busiest. This visibility can be addictive for anyone who enjoys understanding their network’s behavior. It’s also helpful for identifying rogue devices or apps that constantly phone home.</p>    <p>Pi-hole works excellently as a standalone tool, but it’s even better when paired with Unbound for encrypted, recursive DNS resolution. This combination creates a secure and private setup where your Raspberry Pi becomes your own DNS authority. Few open-source tools deliver such tangible benefits with so little ongoing maintenance.</p>    <h2>

    <itunes:summary>
      <![CDATA[<p>Linux has a bit of a reputation associated with it, and depending on your computer background, that reputation can be positive or negative in connotation. It's the OS built for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-proxmox-best-os-for-your-homelab/" target="_blank">servers</a>, tinkerers, and developers, and not for the weak-minded. Its incredible robustness and flexibility often feel like a curse rather than a blessing for those who haven't been well exposed to it, and often times that can <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gaming-on-linux-still-isnt-perfect-heres-why-i-switched-off-of-it/" target="_blank">turn many users away</a> from it for good.</p>    <p>Immutable distros have been helping flip that script. They're built to be reliable, hard to break, and far less intimidating than their mutable counterparts. Operating systems like Bazzite, Fedora Silverblue and openSUSE Aeon are changing what it means to run a Linux system, offering an experience that is often safer, more consistent, and way more <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/if-youre-choosing-a-linux-distro-for-gaming-try-these-two-first/" target="_blank">friendly to new users</a>. If you've ever wanted to try Linux, an immutable distro can be the perfect place to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-transition-windows-linux/" target="_blank">jump in with both feet</a>.</p>    <h2>
What is an immutable Linux distribution?
</h2><h3>
Linux with guardrails
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Fedora Silverblue with the settings app open" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/08/fedora.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> On a traditional, mutable Linux operating system, the base system files are writable. Everything goes; you and your apps can change anything at will, giving an incredible amount of flexibility, but it also can mean your system feels fragile. Updates can conflict, dependencies can clash, and things can be easily overwritten and lost forever.</p>    <p>An immutable operating system is essentially the opposite. The base system files are persistent, read-only, and are isolated meaning you're limited in the changes you can make. Much of the damage you could do on a normal distro is completely mitigated by this approach, but you can still install applications and use the system as you normally would.</p>    <h2>
A big safety net is important
</h2><h3>
Seemingly innocuous changes can result in a broken system
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="bazzite-rx-9060-xt-7" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/06/bazzite-rx-9060-xt-7.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> One of the biggest hurdles for new Linux users is the fear of breaking something, and on most distros, that fear is 100% justified. I can't tell you how many times I've edited the wrong configuration file, tried to uninstall a package I didn't fully understand, and ended up breaking something.</p>    <p>Immutable distros largely eliminate that problem. Because the core system is read-only, you can’t accidentally corrupt it. If something goes wrong with an update, you just reboot and roll back to the previous state, which is known as an "atomic" design. For a newcomer learning Linux, that kind of safety net is super important, and will definitely come in handy.</p>    <h2>
Applications don't get in your way
</h2><h3>
And updates are simple
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-2120542988" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-2120542988" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-2120542988" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-2120542988" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-2120542988-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>For the experienced Linux user, keeping up with updates, installing applications, and fixing conflicts can seem like business as usual, but for someone coming from Windows or macOS, that burden can be a little too much to bear. They expect to install something and have it work regardless of what other changes they may make on their system, and thankfully, immutable distros handle that burden for you.</p>    <p>With a package manager like Flatpak, you can ensure any dependencies your favorite applications need are installed and kept separate from everything else on your system. All applications are self-contained, and you don't need to worry about one app update breaking another.</p>    <p>That consistency also makes online help far more reliable. If you’re running Bazzite 42, your base system is identical to everyone else’s using that version. Troubleshooting guides actually match your setup instead of sending you down a rabbit hole of missing packages or outdated repos.</p>    <h2>
Which immutable distros should you try?
</h2><h3>
The answer depends on what you plan to do on your system
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="bazzite-rx-9060-xt-6" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/06/bazzite-rx-9060-xt-6.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Not all immutable distros are built the same, some are tuned for gamers, others for general desktop use. <a href="https://bazzite.gg/" target="_blank">Bazzite</a> is a Fedora-based immutable distro specifically built for gamers. It includes up-to-date drivers, Proton, Steam, and handheld compatibility out of the box. If you want something for gaming that just works, start there.</p>    <p>For general use, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/" target="_blank">Fedora Silverblue</a> or Kinoite are immutable flavors of Fedora with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gnome-tweaks-that-i-cant-live-without/" target="_blank">GNOME</a> and KDE desktop environments, respectively. These are ideal for someone who just wants a clean, stable system. Additionally, <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Aeon" target="_blank">openSUSE Aeon</a> takes openSUSE's reliability and adds immutability, giving you another user-friendly KDE option.</p>    <p>Honestly, you can't really go wrong with any of these. No matter which one you start with, the common thread is the same: you can’t really mess it up, unless you really try to. Every option lets you explore Linux without worrying about breaking your install.</p>    <h3>
A better way to learn Linux
</h3>
<p>Whether you've been affected by the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-breaks-windows-10-to-11-upgrade-tool/" target="_blank">sunsetting of Windows 10</a> or if you’re just tired of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-you-might-roll-back-windows-update/" target="_blank">Windows updates</a> breaking your setup, even if you're apprehensive about trying Linux, try an <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/immutable-operating-systems-are-a-blessing-and-a-curse/" target="_blank">immutable distro</a>. It's a really great way to get your feet wet in a Linux environment without needing to worry about breaking it. Explore them (or even a mutable distro) in a VM, and see which ones you like.</p>]]>

<p> On a traditional, mutable Linux operating system, the base system files are writable. Everything goes; you and your apps can change anything at will, giving an incredible amount of flexibility, but it also can mean your system feels fragile. Updates can conflict, dependencies can clash, and things can be easily overwritten and lost forever.</p>    <p>An immutable operating system is essentially the opposite. The base system files are persistent, read-only, and are isolated meaning you're limited in the changes you can make. Much of the damage you could do on a normal distro is completely mitigated by this approach, but you can still install applications and use the system as you normally would.</p>    <h2>

      <![CDATA[<p>Ever since it was first revealed with a teaser trailer back in 2021, <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> is a game that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/star-wars-games-dont-need-to-be-in-the-high-republic-because-they-can-explore-these-eras-instead" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars</em> fans have wanted</a> to get their hands on. Unfortunately, the project was halted, despite the very positive reception that the reveal trailer had online. The original <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> is considered by many to be one of the best video games based on the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise, and is also considered one of the most important role-playing games released for the original Xbox. So it's totally understandable why a remake of the game would be desirable to <em>Star Wars</em> fans. But a recent leak may have given everyone a quick peek at what the game was going to be, and it reveals some interesting things about it.</p>    <p>One of the biggest and saddest reasons why <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> from Aspyr Media did not come out was because of how early the project was in development. For a long time, we never got to see much of the game after its initial reveal, even though discussions about it were constant online over social media and forums. But with the leak of images showing the game being put together, with aspects of models that would've appeared in it, <em>Star Wars</em> fans will have some more clarity about what this highly sought-after remake of a classic may have been like. Here's why The <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> leak shows exactly why we won't get this version of the game, despite fans desperately wanting it so badly.</p>    <h2>
Very early in the process
</h2><h3>
The bare bones of the Old Republic
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-991883062" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-991883062" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-991883062" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-991883062" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-991883062-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The leak of <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> was seen after items from the portfolio of a former Aspyr Media artist <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-development-screenshots-from-cancelled-star-wars-kotor-remake-by-aspyr-surfaces" target="_blank">were spotted online</a>, who left the project in 2022 when work on Aspyr's project was stopped. After many outlets reported on it and people discussed the images online, they were eventually taken down. However, before they were removed, people were able to see what type of work was being done on the game and get an idea of how far along the development team was. And for the most part, things were still in the early stages, with objects (weapons and environmental objects) being created in 3D programs and concept art being put together. For every game ever made, this is pretty standard, but because this was for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/star-wars-knights-old-republic-remake-different-original" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em></a>, it was a big deal to everyone.</p>    <p>While there may be a lot more work that was done behind the scenes that everyone hasn't seen yet, what everyone was able to see from the leak is that the game still had a long way to go. From the time that <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> was put on hiatus, many of the rumors that floated around were because both PlayStation and Lucasfilm were not satisfied with the progress that was being made. The result was the art director and design director for the game at Aspyr were let go, and the project was handed over to Saber Interactive, which has been in progress ever since.</p>

</div>
<p> What is abundantly clear from the leaks is that <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> was going to be very ambitious and big, matching up to the level of prestige that fans place on the original game. And while whatever it becomes under the banner of Saber Interactive, the first steps for a true <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/the-3-missing-star-wars-game-remasters-that-fans-desperately-want-lucasfilm-to-release" target="_blank">remake of the <em>Star Wars</em> classic</a> seemed to be in a good direction, even though it was hardly that far along.</p>    <h2>
Incredibly high expectations
</h2><h3>
Not just any Star Wars game
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-925138231" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-925138231" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-925138231" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-925138231" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-925138231-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the biggest challenges that this project under Aspyr Media had to overcome was to deliver a remake that lived up to the expectations of <em>Star Wars</em> fans around the world, who put the original <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> in such high regard. And for any studio, that would be a gargantuan task that is not easily done. It's hard enough to deliver <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/accepted-dark-souls-games-after-playing-star-wars-jedi-games" target="_blank">a great <em>Star Wars</em> game to fans of the franchise</a>, but it's on another level to retread what many consider to be one of the all-time greats to ever be released.</p>    <p>The leaks of what looked like a test for gameplay appeared to have a good outline of what players would see on screen, with a perspective and layout for a HUD that seemed like a great start. Having pictures of characters from the original game, like Mission Vao, on the side to switch between would have been great. Items from the same portfolio leak showed a level of detail on weapons and objects that players would have on hand, including vibroblades and a blaster that could have been customized in some ways. One could only imagine what it may have been like to see a lightsaber fully rendered in a place with the same level of detail that some of the leaked photos show. It may have been something to help keep the project over at Aspyr Media.</p>

<small>Credit:&nbsp;Lucasfilm Games</small>
</div>
</div>
<p> But as ambitious as things may have seemed, there is no way that the game would be ready for consoles anytime soon. The amount of work and attention to detail would have taken a very long time, especially with the in-progress shots showing that background objects would be just as <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/female-star-wars-game-characters" target="_blank">detailed as character models</a>. Anyone making a good guess about where the project was at the time of being put on hold would have said that <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> was probably years off from ever being released. And that's probably time that wasn't reasonably available before the call was made to put a stop to this version of the game.</p>    <h2>
Never getting this one now
</h2><h3>
A remake may be different

<p>The response to the leaked images of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/star-wars-knights-old-republic-remake-different-original" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em></a> has been positive online, with many thinking that what was there was very interesting and could have made for a great game. But seeing them now also brings up a sad point about what a remake of <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> will ultimately become for <em>Star Wars</em> fans, if ever there is one released down the line. Things are just going to be different and not exactly what we may have thought after seeing the reveal trailer in 2021.</p>    <p>We'll never get to see what that final vision was from Aspyr Media that was planned for the <em>KOTOR</em> remake. What we'll get will probably turn out very different from Saber Interactive when they finish their project, for better or worse. And maybe that's a good thing in some ways, especially since the leaks show just how early on things were in the development process. But there's always going to be that question of what Aspyr's <em>KOTOR </em>remake would have been, much in the same way<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/doom-series-every-core-game-ranked" target="_blank"> <em>DOOM </em>2016</a> fans will always ask what the original concept for <em>DOOM 4</em> could have been like if development never changed mid-way. The Darth Revan of Asypr Media will always be a lingering question, even after we see what Saber Interactive's Darth Revan is like.</p>

<h3>
Still waiting on The Old Republic
</h3>
<p>With the same level of patience as Master Yoda, <em>Star Wars</em> fans are still hoping to see <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> become a reality. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/the-5-best-remastered-star-wars-games-you-can-play-on-consoles-right-now" target="_blank">The original game is still beloved</a> and played by many people on newer consoles, with the re-release by Aspyr Media in 2021 on Nintendo Switch being the easiest way to do so. For die-hard fans of the Old Republic, the leaked images give a look at what could have been something truly extraordinary and ambitious on a galactic level, but was unfortunately not destined to be. Maybe it was the will of the force or the ill-timing of game development, but fans are still waiting to return to the days of The Old Republic. With how things have gone for the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise over the past few years, and with the popularity of other <em>Star Wars</em> titles on consoles, maybe these are the first signs that a return to <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> is over the horizon. We'll just have to keep waiting and see.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Ever since it was first revealed with a teaser trailer back in 2021, <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> is a game that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/star-wars-games-dont-need-to-be-in-the-high-republic-because-they-can-explore-these-eras-instead" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars</em> fans have wanted</a> to get their hands on. Unfortunately, the project was halted, despite the very positive reception that the reveal trailer had online. The original <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> is considered by many to be one of the best video games based on the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise, and is also considered one of the most important role-playing games released for the original Xbox. So it's totally understandable why a remake of the game would be desirable to <em>Star Wars</em> fans. But a recent leak may have given everyone a quick peek at what the game was going to be, and it reveals some interesting things about it.</p>    <p>One of the biggest and saddest reasons why <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> from Aspyr Media did not come out was because of how early the project was in development. For a long time, we never got to see much of the game after its initial reveal, even though discussions about it were constant online over social media and forums. But with the leak of images showing the game being put together, with aspects of models that would've appeared in it, <em>Star Wars</em> fans will have some more clarity about what this highly sought-after remake of a classic may have been like. Here's why The <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> leak shows exactly why we won't get this version of the game, despite fans desperately wanting it so badly.</p>    <h2>
Very early in the process
</h2><h3>
The bare bones of the Old Republic
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-991883062" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-991883062" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-991883062" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-991883062" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-991883062-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The leak of <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> was seen after items from the portfolio of a former Aspyr Media artist <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-development-screenshots-from-cancelled-star-wars-kotor-remake-by-aspyr-surfaces" target="_blank">were spotted online</a>, who left the project in 2022 when work on Aspyr's project was stopped. After many outlets reported on it and people discussed the images online, they were eventually taken down. However, before they were removed, people were able to see what type of work was being done on the game and get an idea of how far along the development team was. And for the most part, things were still in the early stages, with objects (weapons and environmental objects) being created in 3D programs and concept art being put together. For every game ever made, this is pretty standard, but because this was for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/star-wars-knights-old-republic-remake-different-original" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em></a>, it was a big deal to everyone.</p>    <p>While there may be a lot more work that was done behind the scenes that everyone hasn't seen yet, what everyone was able to see from the leak is that the game still had a long way to go. From the time that <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> was put on hiatus, many of the rumors that floated around were because both PlayStation and Lucasfilm were not satisfied with the progress that was being made. The result was the art director and design director for the game at Aspyr were let go, and the project was handed over to Saber Interactive, which has been in progress ever since.</p>

</div>
<p> What is abundantly clear from the leaks is that <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> was going to be very ambitious and big, matching up to the level of prestige that fans place on the original game. And while whatever it becomes under the banner of Saber Interactive, the first steps for a true <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/the-3-missing-star-wars-game-remasters-that-fans-desperately-want-lucasfilm-to-release" target="_blank">remake of the <em>Star Wars</em> classic</a> seemed to be in a good direction, even though it was hardly that far along.</p>    <h2>
Incredibly high expectations
</h2><h3>
Not just any Star Wars game
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-925138231" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-925138231" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-925138231" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-925138231" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-925138231-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the biggest challenges that this project under Aspyr Media had to overcome was to deliver a remake that lived up to the expectations of <em>Star Wars</em> fans around the world, who put the original <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> in such high regard. And for any studio, that would be a gargantuan task that is not easily done. It's hard enough to deliver <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/accepted-dark-souls-games-after-playing-star-wars-jedi-games" target="_blank">a great <em>Star Wars</em> game to fans of the franchise</a>, but it's on another level to retread what many consider to be one of the all-time greats to ever be released.</p>    <p>The leaks of what looked like a test for gameplay appeared to have a good outline of what players would see on screen, with a perspective and layout for a HUD that seemed like a great start. Having pictures of characters from the original game, like Mission Vao, on the side to switch between would have been great. Items from the same portfolio leak showed a level of detail on weapons and objects that players would have on hand, including vibroblades and a blaster that could have been customized in some ways. One could only imagine what it may have been like to see a lightsaber fully rendered in a place with the same level of detail that some of the leaked photos show. It may have been something to help keep the project over at Aspyr Media.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p> But as ambitious as things may have seemed, there is no way that the game would be ready for consoles anytime soon. The amount of work and attention to detail would have taken a very long time, especially with the in-progress shots showing that background objects would be just as <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/female-star-wars-game-characters" target="_blank">detailed as character models</a>. Anyone making a good guess about where the project was at the time of being put on hold would have said that <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> was probably years off from ever being released. And that's probably time that wasn't reasonably available before the call was made to put a stop to this version of the game.</p>    <h2>
Never getting this one now
</h2><h3>
A remake may be different
</h3>

<p>The response to the leaked images of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/star-wars-knights-old-republic-remake-different-original" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em></a> has been positive online, with many thinking that what was there was very interesting and could have made for a great game. But seeing them now also brings up a sad point about what a remake of <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> will ultimately become for <em>Star Wars</em> fans, if ever there is one released down the line. Things are just going to be different and not exactly what we may have thought after seeing the reveal trailer in 2021.</p>    <p>We'll never get to see what that final vision was from Aspyr Media that was planned for the <em>KOTOR</em> remake. What we'll get will probably turn out very different from Saber Interactive when they finish their project, for better or worse. And maybe that's a good thing in some ways, especially since the leaks show just how early on things were in the development process. But there's always going to be that question of what Aspyr's <em>KOTOR </em>remake would have been, much in the same way<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/doom-series-every-core-game-ranked" target="_blank"> <em>DOOM </em>2016</a> fans will always ask what the original concept for <em>DOOM 4</em> could have been like if development never changed mid-way. The Darth Revan of Asypr Media will always be a lingering question, even after we see what Saber Interactive's Darth Revan is like.</p>

<h3>
Still waiting on The Old Republic
</h3>
<p>With the same level of patience as Master Yoda, <em>Star Wars</em> fans are still hoping to see <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> become a reality. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/the-5-best-remastered-star-wars-games-you-can-play-on-consoles-right-now" target="_blank">The original game is still beloved</a> and played by many people on newer consoles, with the re-release by Aspyr Media in 2021 on Nintendo Switch being the easiest way to do so. For die-hard fans of the Old Republic, the leaked images give a look at what could have been something truly extraordinary and ambitious on a galactic level, but was unfortunately not destined to be. Maybe it was the will of the force or the ill-timing of game development, but fans are still waiting to return to the days of The Old Republic. With how things have gone for the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise over the past few years, and with the popularity of other <em>Star Wars</em> titles on consoles, maybe these are the first signs that a return to <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> is over the horizon. We'll just have to keep waiting and see.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since it was first revealed with a teaser trailer back in 2021, <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> is a game that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/star-wars-games-dont-need-to-be-in-the-high-republic-because-they-can-explore-these-eras-instead" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars</em> fans have wanted</a> to get their hands on. Unfortunately, the project was halted, despite the very positive reception that the reveal trailer had online. The original <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> is considered by many to be one of the best video games based on the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise, and is also considered one of the most important role-playing games released for the original Xbox. So it's totally understandable why a remake of the game would be desirable to <em>Star Wars</em> fans. But a recent leak may have given everyone a quick peek at what the game was going to be, and it reveals some interesting things about it.</p>    <p>One of the biggest and saddest reasons why <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> from Aspyr Media did not come out was because of how early the project was in development. For a long time, we never got to see much of the game after its initial reveal, even though discussions about it were constant online over social media and forums. But with the leak of images showing the game being put together, with aspects of models that would've appeared in it, <em>Star Wars</em> fans will have some more clarity about what this highly sought-after remake of a classic may have been like. Here's why The <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> leak shows exactly why we won't get this version of the game, despite fans desperately wanting it so badly.</p>    <h2>
Very early in the process
</h2><h3>
The bare bones of the Old Republic
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-991883062" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-991883062" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-991883062" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-991883062" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-991883062-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The leak of <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> was seen after items from the portfolio of a former Aspyr Media artist <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-development-screenshots-from-cancelled-star-wars-kotor-remake-by-aspyr-surfaces" target="_blank">were spotted online</a>, who left the project in 2022 when work on Aspyr's project was stopped. After many outlets reported on it and people discussed the images online, they were eventually taken down. However, before they were removed, people were able to see what type of work was being done on the game and get an idea of how far along the development team was. And for the most part, things were still in the early stages, with objects (weapons and environmental objects) being created in 3D programs and concept art being put together. For every game ever made, this is pretty standard, but because this was for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/star-wars-knights-old-republic-remake-different-original" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em></a>, it was a big deal to everyone.</p>    <p>While there may be a lot more work that was done behind the scenes that everyone hasn't seen yet, what everyone was able to see from the leak is that the game still had a long way to go. From the time that <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> was put on hiatus, many of the rumors that floated around were because both PlayStation and Lucasfilm were not satisfied with the progress that was being made. The result was the art director and design director for the game at Aspyr were let go, and the project was handed over to Saber Interactive, which has been in progress ever since.</p>

</div>
<p> What is abundantly clear from the leaks is that <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> was going to be very ambitious and big, matching up to the level of prestige that fans place on the original game. And while whatever it becomes under the banner of Saber Interactive, the first steps for a true <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/the-3-missing-star-wars-game-remasters-that-fans-desperately-want-lucasfilm-to-release" target="_blank">remake of the <em>Star Wars</em> classic</a> seemed to be in a good direction, even though it was hardly that far along.</p>    <h2>
Incredibly high expectations
</h2><h3>
Not just any Star Wars game
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-925138231" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-925138231" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-925138231" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-925138231" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-925138231-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the biggest challenges that this project under Aspyr Media had to overcome was to deliver a remake that lived up to the expectations of <em>Star Wars</em> fans around the world, who put the original <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> in such high regard. And for any studio, that would be a gargantuan task that is not easily done. It's hard enough to deliver <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/accepted-dark-souls-games-after-playing-star-wars-jedi-games" target="_blank">a great <em>Star Wars</em> game to fans of the franchise</a>, but it's on another level to retread what many consider to be one of the all-time greats to ever be released.</p>    <p>The leaks of what looked like a test for gameplay appeared to have a good outline of what players would see on screen, with a perspective and layout for a HUD that seemed like a great start. Having pictures of characters from the original game, like Mission Vao, on the side to switch between would have been great. Items from the same portfolio leak showed a level of detail on weapons and objects that players would have on hand, including vibroblades and a blaster that could have been customized in some ways. One could only imagine what it may have been like to see a lightsaber fully rendered in a place with the same level of detail that some of the leaked photos show. It may have been something to help keep the project over at Aspyr Media.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p> But as ambitious as things may have seemed, there is no way that the game would be ready for consoles anytime soon. The amount of work and attention to detail would have taken a very long time, especially with the in-progress shots showing that background objects would be just as <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/female-star-wars-game-characters" target="_blank">detailed as character models</a>. Anyone making a good guess about where the project was at the time of being put on hold would have said that <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> was probably years off from ever being released. And that's probably time that wasn't reasonably available before the call was made to put a stop to this version of the game.</p>    <h2>
Never getting this one now
</h2><h3>
A remake may be different
</h3>

<p>The response to the leaked images of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/star-wars-knights-old-republic-remake-different-original" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em></a> has been positive online, with many thinking that what was there was very interesting and could have made for a great game. But seeing them now also brings up a sad point about what a remake of <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> will ultimately become for <em>Star Wars</em> fans, if ever there is one released down the line. Things are just going to be different and not exactly what we may have thought after seeing the reveal trailer in 2021.</p>    <p>We'll never get to see what that final vision was from Aspyr Media that was planned for the <em>KOTOR</em> remake. What we'll get will probably turn out very different from Saber Interactive when they finish their project, for better or worse. And maybe that's a good thing in some ways, especially since the leaks show just how early on things were in the development process. But there's always going to be that question of what Aspyr's <em>KOTOR </em>remake would have been, much in the same way<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/doom-series-every-core-game-ranked" target="_blank"> <em>DOOM </em>2016</a> fans will always ask what the original concept for <em>DOOM 4</em> could have been like if development never changed mid-way. The Darth Revan of Asypr Media will always be a lingering question, even after we see what Saber Interactive's Darth Revan is like.</p>

<h3>
Still waiting on The Old Republic
</h3>
<p>With the same level of patience as Master Yoda, <em>Star Wars</em> fans are still hoping to see <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> become a reality. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/the-5-best-remastered-star-wars-games-you-can-play-on-consoles-right-now" target="_blank">The original game is still beloved</a> and played by many people on newer consoles, with the re-release by Aspyr Media in 2021 on Nintendo Switch being the easiest way to do so. For die-hard fans of the Old Republic, the leaked images give a look at what could have been something truly extraordinary and ambitious on a galactic level, but was unfortunately not destined to be. Maybe it was the will of the force or the ill-timing of game development, but fans are still waiting to return to the days of The Old Republic. With how things have gone for the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise over the past few years, and with the popularity of other <em>Star Wars</em> titles on consoles, maybe these are the first signs that a return to <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em> is over the horizon. We'll just have to keep waiting and see.</p>

<p>The current DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Modules) form factor for RAM has been around for years, and it'll be what you immediately think of as system memory. But the push for faster speeds has meant that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/strange-reason-empty-ram-slots-might-be-hurting-ram-performance/" target="_blank">motherboard memory slots are causing signaling issues</a> with DDR5, as they start to generate radio interference thanks to the physics involved.</p>

<p>CAMM2 stands for Compression Attached Memory Module (version 2), and instead of the connectors being in a line, it has a grid that looks similar to the bottom of a CPU. Rearranging the connectors shortens the traces needed, which improves stability, and the CAMM2 module is also designed to replicate the topology that used to be handled by up to four DIMM sockets, but in a very much smaller area, reducing the distance electrical signals need to pass even further.</p>    <p>Each module is thinner than traditional large-capacity memory modules, as the NAND is only on one side, and each can currently hold up to 128GB of RAM, which is more than most computing tasks need presently.</p>    <h3>
Why do we need a new form factor?
</h3>

<p>CAMM2 isn't a huge concern for desktop users, which is partly why motherboard manufacturers are still validating its use and how to position it on the PCB. DDR5 already comes in large capacities and speeds past 8,000MT/s, without being too badly affected by the signaling issues. But to push past 9,000MT/s or so reliably, the longer traces of DIMMs become more of an issue, and that's why we see companies like <a href="https://www.gskill.com/community/1502239313/1751444655/G.SKILL-CAMM2-DDR5-Memory-Module-Demonstrates-DDR5-10000-Overclock-Speed-on-ASUS-Z890-Motherboard" target="_blank">G.Skill making CAMM2 modules that manage 10,000MT/s</a>.</p>    <p>It's more beneficial for laptop users right now, because SODIMMs start to suffer past 6,400MT/s, are only available up to 32GB per module, and they're double-sided so thick when at that capacity. The other option right now for laptop makers is to solder the RAM to the board or to the CPU, which means no upgrade path. CAMM2 can fit up to 128GB of RAM in less space than four SODIMMs, making it an attractive alternative when upgradability is a concern.</p>    <h2>
CAMM2 will enable faster RAM speeds

While increasing the stability of the system

<p>CAMM2 currently enables 9,600MT/s speeds without overclocking past the XMP settings, with a maximum capacity of 128GB per stick. Each module is dual-channel on its own thanks to the new electrical pathing, and the reduced traces promise better stability.</p>    <p>It might not be completely necessary for DDR5, but DDR6 and beyond are on the horizon, and anything that improves on memory stability is a good thing in my books. DDR3 and DDR4 were relatively easy to run at stable speeds and latencies, while I've had plenty of issues getting DDR5 modules running at their advertised settings, let alone anything higher.</p>    <h3>
It's a polarizing design
</h3>
<p>I've been speaking to PC enthusiasts over the last few months about CAMM2, and they've got mixed feelings. Some welcome the increased speeds and promised reliability, while others don't want the form factor on desktop motherboards. The single module design of current implementations is the biggest sticking point, with the community not happy that it means replacing the entire RAM module if they want a larger capacity. Others like the aesthetics of filling four RAM slots, and think the flat design is a bit boring.</p>    <h3>
I can't wait to have CAMM2 RAM in my computer
</h3>
<p>Every PC I've built for personal use has had the fastest memory sticks I could find at the time, with the lowest latencies. I've always overclocked my RAM past those limits, and had good results until DDR5 arrived. And after years of DDR5 causing weird issues and stability glitches, I'm ready for a change. I've been working on getting hands-on experience with CAMM2 motherboards for a while now, and I can't wait to see what the new paradigm for memory packaging will bring to the table.</p>]]>

<p>CAMM2 isn't a huge concern for desktop users, which is partly why motherboard manufacturers are still validating its use and how to position it on the PCB. DDR5 already comes in large capacities and speeds past 8,000MT/s, without being too badly affected by the signaling issues.

Sure, speeds, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-why-ram-timings-matter/" target="_blank">latencies</a>, capacities, and generations have come and gone over the years, and the pin count has changed slightly, but DIMMs and SODIMMs have stayed a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-install-ram/" target="_blank">recognizable shape and form</a>.</p>    <p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/we-need-to-talk-about-ddr5/" target="_blank">DDR5 memory is now a mature technology</a>, but we're hitting the limits of what the DIMM packaging method can produce, and that's a problem. <span>This is not so much for DDR5, but because <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ddr6-for-the-desktop-might-look-weird/" target="_blank">DDR6 for desktops and laptops</a> is coming in a few years, it</span> calls for changes.

<p>The current DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Modules) form factor for RAM has been around for years, and it'll be what you immediately think of as system memory. But the push for faster speeds has meant that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/strange-reason-empty-ram-slots-might-be-hurting-ram-performance/" target="_blank">motherboard memory slots are causing signaling issues</a> with DDR5, as they start to generate radio interference thanks to the physics involved.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>The modern battle for productivity is often fought with clocks rather than with inefficient tools. There's a crushing overabundance of assists and tasks to accomplish, yet very little time, because digital environments are engineered to shatter sustained focus. We're constantly pulled in a dozen directions by notifications, endless feeds, and the siren song of browser tabs, and my workdays were no different until <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pomodoro-apps-with-more-features/" target="_blank">I found the Pomodoro Technique</a>. The concept is brilliantly simple — break your task down into manageable, goal-oriented chunks, typically 25 to 30 minutes long, separated by short, timed breaks. This rhythm of focused work followed by brief rest respects the limits of human concentration and prevents burnout.</p>    <p>The technique gets its quirky name from the Italian word for "tomato," inspired by the tomato-shaped kitchen timer its creator, Francesco Cirillo, used as a student. You could, of course, place a physical kitchen timer on your desk, but let's be honest, it looks rather out of place next to a mechanical keyboard and a 4K monitor. An hourglass I had sitting around is even worse, with no reset option until it runs out. Modern operating systems like Windows 11 integrate something similar, like Focus Mode in the Clock app, and it even syncs to play music from a chosen service when you're focused. However, it's a blunt, OS-wide tool that doesn't fence you into the task at hand, so staying focused depends on your often fallible self-discipline. Moreover, switching to the Clock app repeatedly is tiresome.</p>    <p>For those of us who live and work in a web browser, there’s salvation in a much better integrated solution — browser extensions.</p>    <h2>

<p> If your work life is anything like mine, it’s a chaotic dance across multiple devices and operating systems. I might start writing an article on my Windows desktop, move to a Linux-powered netbook on the couch for a change of scenery, and then get sidetracked on my Android phone. I could use a standalone timer app or a physical gadget like an island in this workflow, but it would become just one more element in a multi-component system. However, I use the Chrome browser on all my devices, regardless of OS, and I value the seamless sync of settings, bookmarks, and extensions across them.</p>    <p>Using a Pomodoro timer web extension will ensure it follows me everywhere, thanks to the sync. It's the next best thing to a dedicated physical gadget, without adding more clutter to your desk or <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/e-ink-pomodoro-timer-esp32/" target="_blank">another device</a> that needs charging or replacement batteries. Sure, extensions don't work on Android yet, but on the more work-oriented devices, my Pomodoro extension syncs session data. The real magic happens when continuous, synced tracking aggregates data into useful insights about my work habits at the end of the week or month, which a disparate collection of timers could never do.</p>    <h2>

<p> Beyond being a simple metronome for your focus, a good Pomodoro extension can become an invaluable record-keeping tool. For freelancers, consultants, or anyone who bills by the hour, accurately tracking time is non-negotiable. A browser extension can log the time you spend working on specific tasks or projects. Each completed Pomodoro session is a quantifiable block of work, making it incredibly easy to tally up your hours and invoice clients confidently every month, without retroactively piecing together workdays with educated guesses about how long tasks took.</p>    <p>Some of these Chrome web extensions also help gamify <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/improved-task-time-management-with-free-open-source-tool/" target="_blank">productivity goals</a>, turning the otherwise mundane act of staying on task into a personal challenge with virtual rewards. They use dashboards to visualize progress, showing me streaks of completed sessions, daily or weekly totals, and other metrics. This creates a positive feedback loop, where progress motivates me to stick to a system of timed, focused work for consistent productivity. It transforms productivity from a chore into a game against your procrastination tendencies.</p>    <h2>

<p>I didn't jump the gun and consider a browser extension as the first and best solution. My journey started with PWAs and websites offering online Pomodoro timers with glanceable information in my tab switcher window. However, within an hour, it was just one of 37 tabs I had opened, and I started missing alerts. In contrast, a web extension lives in the Chrome toolbar, always a click away and hard to miss, no matter how deep my Reddit research goes. For anyone whose work is largely web-based, this is a game-changer. The timer helps you maintain a steady, productive cadence with a prominent foreground presence.</p>    <p>This also reduces the effort and friction required to start a new focus session. I'm also greatly pleased by how a browser extension keeps me from reaching for my phone to set a timer or switch apps on my PC, which risks getting sidetracked. It minimizes context-switching, which is a known productivity killer. The timer must remain a natural part of my browser environment.</p>    <h2>
One tool to block distractions too
</h2><h3>
More than two birds with one stone

</div>
</div>
<p> Another significant advantage of using a Pomodoro timer through a browser extension comes in enforceable limits. If you're using a separate app, device, or PWA to stay focused, the onus of avoiding distractions like social media and inbound notifications still lies with you and your self-control. I'll admit, the pull is strong, and I nearly gave up on timed focus sessions until I figured I could leverage the permissions an extension enjoys in my browser's architecture. They can act as a guardrail when your willpower falters, since they can block sites the same way an ad-blocking extension blocks ads.</p>    <p>I initially <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/one-sec-productivity-extension/" target="_blank">relied on extensions like One Sec</a>, which add friction to accessing distracting websites. Instead of an outright block, they make me wait a few seconds or complete a breathing exercise and reconsider my choice before accessing the site for a limited duration of my choosing. While effective, this interfered with recreational content consumption as well. So, I switched to an <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/blaawk/pbnfhkmfddkhbenbjbajgonmbdaclbak" target="_blank">extension called Blaawk</a>. It integrates a full-fledged website blocker with a Pomodoro timer, making online distractions completely off-limits while you're in a focus session. This might sound extreme, but for anyone who's easily derailed, having an automated system that removes temptation only when you're focused might be all that prevents you from wasting the entire day. Moreover, Blaawk also has a fully featured <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/kanban-board-cured-task-to-do-list-cant-go-back/" target="_blank">Kanban board that links tasks</a> to Pomodoro sessions, automatic focus session scheduling and site blocking, site whitelists, and blocker aggression settings — <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/replaced-expensive-productivity-apps-with-free-tools-couldnt-be-happier/" target="_blank">all for free</a>.</p>    <h3>
Automating the clock made me more efficient, and can help you too
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Pomocat Pomodoro timer running on a phone placed in a stand on a white desk with books in the backdrop" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/02/xda-pomocat.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Ultimately, any productivity system should free up your mental bandwidth to focus on actual work. A Pomodoro timer offloads clock-watching to an automated flow with alerts while you soak in the task at hand instead of wondering when you should take a break. Over time, this could help you become more efficient, as you train your brain to enter a state of deep focus on command, knowing that a designated break is always just around the corner. For those who work online, a simple browser extension can be the key that unlocks this structured, less stressful, and profoundly productive way of working as it did for me.</p>]]>

<p> Another significant advantage of using a Pomodoro timer through a browser extension comes in enforceable limits. If you're using a separate app, device, or PWA to stay focused, the onus of avoiding distractions like social media and inbound notifications still lies with you and your self-control. I'll admit, the pull is strong, and I nearly gave up on timed focus sessions until I figured I could leverage the permissions an extension enjoys in my browser's architecture. They can act as a guardrail when your willpower falters, since they can block sites the same way an ad-blocking extension blocks ads.</p>    <p>I initially <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/one-sec-productivity-extension/" target="_blank">relied on extensions like One Sec</a>, which add friction to accessing distracting websites. Instead of an outright block, they make me wait a few seconds or complete a breathing exercise and reconsider my choice before accessing the site for a limited duration of my choosing. While effective, this interfered with recreational content consumption as well. So, I switched to an <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/blaawk/pbnfhkmfddkhbenbjbajgonmbdaclbak" target="_blank">extension called Blaawk</a>. It integrates a full-fledged website blocker with a Pomodoro timer, making online distractions completely off-limits while you're in a focus session. This might sound extreme, but for anyone who's easily derailed, having an automated system that removes temptation only when you're focused might be all that prevents you from wasting the entire day. Moreover, Blaawk also has a fully featured <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/kanban-board-cured-task-to-do-list-cant-go-back/" target="_blank">Kanban board that links tasks</a> to Pomodoro sessions, automatic focus session scheduling and site blocking, site whitelists, and blocker aggression settings — <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/replaced-expensive-productivity-apps-with-free-tools-couldnt-be-happier/" target="_blank">all for free</a>.</p>    <h3>

<p> Ultimately, any productivity system should free up your mental bandwidth to focus on actual work. A Pomodoro timer offloads clock-watching to an automated flow with alerts while you soak in the task at hand instead of wondering when you should take a break. Over time, this could help you become more efficient, as you train your brain to enter a state of deep focus on command, knowing that a designated break is always just around the corner. For those who work online, a simple browser extension can be the key that unlocks this structured, less stressful, and profoundly productive way of working as it did for me.</p>]]>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The modern battle for productivity is often fought with clocks rather than with inefficient tools. There's a crushing overabundance of assists and tasks to accomplish, yet very little time, because digital environments are engineered to shatter sustained focus. We're constantly pulled in a dozen directions by notifications, endless feeds, and the siren song of browser tabs, and my workdays were no different until <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pomodoro-apps-with-more-features/" target="_blank">I found the Pomodoro Technique</a>. The concept is brilliantly simple — break your task down into manageable, goal-oriented chunks, typically 25 to 30 minutes long, separated by short, timed breaks. This rhythm of focused work followed by brief rest respects the limits of human concentration and prevents burnout.</p>    <p>The technique gets its quirky name from the Italian word for "tomato," inspired by the tomato-shaped kitchen timer its creator, Francesco Cirillo, used as a student. You could, of course, place a physical kitchen timer on your desk, but let's be honest, it looks rather out of place next to a mechanical keyboard and a 4K monitor. An hourglass I had sitting around is even worse, with no reset option until it runs out. Modern operating systems like Windows 11 integrate something similar, like Focus Mode in the Clock app, and it even syncs to play music from a chosen service when you're focused. However, it's a blunt, OS-wide tool that doesn't fence you into the task at hand, so staying focused depends on your often fallible self-discipline. Moreover, switching to the Clock app repeatedly is tiresome.</p>    <p>For those of us who live and work in a web browser, there’s salvation in a much better integrated solution — browser extensions.</p>    <h2>
Sync across your digital life
</h2><h3>
With lower switching between apps

<p> If your work life is anything like mine, it’s a chaotic dance across multiple devices and operating systems. I might start writing an article on my Windows desktop, move to a Linux-powered netbook on the couch for a change of scenery, and then get sidetracked on my Android phone. I could use a standalone timer app or a physical gadget like an island in this workflow, but it would become just one more element in a multi-component system. However, I use the Chrome browser on all my devices, regardless of OS, and I value the seamless sync of settings, bookmarks, and extensions across them.</p>    <p>Using a Pomodoro timer web extension will ensure it follows me everywhere, thanks to the sync. It's the next best thing to a dedicated physical gadget, without adding more clutter to your desk or <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/e-ink-pomodoro-timer-esp32/" target="_blank">another device</a> that needs charging or replacement batteries. Sure, extensions don't work on Android yet, but on the more work-oriented devices, my Pomodoro extension syncs session data. The real magic happens when continuous, synced tracking aggregates data into useful insights about my work habits at the end of the week or month, which a disparate collection of timers could never do.</p>    <h2>
Log your work hours and personal goals
</h2><h3>
Most extensions promise they won't store your data too
</h3>

<p> Beyond being a simple metronome for your focus, a good Pomodoro extension can become an invaluable record-keeping tool. For freelancers, consultants, or anyone who bills by the hour, accurately tracking time is non-negotiable. A browser extension can log the time you spend working on specific tasks or projects. Each completed Pomodoro session is a quantifiable block of work, making it incredibly easy to tally up your hours and invoice clients confidently every month, without retroactively piecing together workdays with educated guesses about how long tasks took.</p>    <p>Some of these Chrome web extensions also help gamify <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/improved-task-time-management-with-free-open-source-tool/" target="_blank">productivity goals</a>, turning the otherwise mundane act of staying on task into a personal challenge with virtual rewards. They use dashboards to visualize progress, showing me streaks of completed sessions, daily or weekly totals, and other metrics. This creates a positive feedback loop, where progress motivates me to stick to a system of timed, focused work for consistent productivity. It transforms productivity from a chore into a game against your procrastination tendencies.</p>    <h2>
A tool in the foreground with active interrupts
</h2><h3>
Leave less to your self-control

</div>
<p>I didn't jump the gun and consider a browser extension as the first and best solution. My journey started with PWAs and websites offering online Pomodoro timers with glanceable information in my tab switcher window. However, within an hour, it was just one of 37 tabs I had opened, and I started missing alerts. In contrast, a web extension lives in the Chrome toolbar, always a click away and hard to miss, no matter how deep my Reddit research goes. For anyone whose work is largely web-based, this is a game-changer. The timer helps you maintain a steady, productive cadence with a prominent foreground presence.</p>    <p>This also reduces the effort and friction required to start a new focus session. I'm also greatly pleased by how a browser extension keeps me from reaching for my phone to set a timer or switch apps on my PC, which risks getting sidetracked. It minimizes context-switching, which is a known productivity killer. The timer must remain a natural part of my browser environment.</p>    <h2>

      <![CDATA[<p>As we get closer and closer to Halloween, it's time to begin stocking up on the horror; that is, if you haven't started already. And what's better for filling out the collection than a free horror game that people have reviewed positively? If you're on the hunt for something creepy this year, Amnesia: The Bunker has been knocked down from $25 to the low, low price of absolutely nothing.</p>    <h2>
Amnesia: The Bunker is free to claim on the Epic Games Store until October 23rd
</h2>
<p>If you've never heard of the Amnesia series, it made a huge splash when its first entry, The Dark Descent, was picked up by YouTubers and streamed to a huge audience. Now, the developers, Frictional Games, have fleshed out the Amnesia series with new entries and even created highly rated horror games that deviate from the Amnesia style, such as SOMA.</p>    <p>Amnesia: The Bunker was released in 2023, and at the time of writing, it has a solid 4.6/5 rating on the Epic Games Store. Here's how Frictional Games describe it:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>Left all alone in a desolate WW1 bunker with only one bullet remaining in the barrel, it’s up to you to face the oppressing terrors in the dark. Keep the lights on at all costs, persevere, and make your way out alive. A truly intense horror experience.</p>
<p>Immerse yourself in the multiple ways of tackling survival. In the shoes of the French soldier Henri Clément, you are armed with a revolver gun, a noisy dynamo flashlight, and other scarce supplies to scavenge and craft along the way. With randomization and unpredictable behavior, no play-through is the same.</p>
<p>Hunted by an ever-present threat reacting to your every move and sound, you must adapt your play-style to face hell. Every decision will change the outcome of how the game responds. Actions bear consequences.</p>
</blockquote><p>Amnesia: The Bunker usually sells for $25, but if you head over to the Epic Games Store, you can claim it for absolutely nothing between now and October 23rd. And if you're not sure if the game is worth your time, we did crown it and its sci-fi brother, SOMA, as some of the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/6-most-underrated-horror-games-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">most underrated horror games for Steam Deck</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>As we get closer and closer to Halloween, it's time to begin stocking up on the horror; that is, if you haven't started already. And what's better for filling out the collection than a free horror game that people have reviewed positively? If you're on the hunt for something creepy this year, Amnesia: The Bunker has been knocked down from $25 to the low, low price of absolutely nothing.</p>    <h2>
Amnesia: The Bunker is free to claim on the Epic Games Store until October 23rd
</h2>
<p>If you've never heard of the Amnesia series, it made a huge splash when its first entry, The Dark Descent, was picked up by YouTubers and streamed to a huge audience. Now, the developers, Frictional Games, have fleshed out the Amnesia series with new entries and even created highly rated horror games that deviate from the Amnesia style, such as SOMA.</p>    <p>Amnesia: The Bunker was released in 2023, and at the time of writing, it has a solid 4.6/5 rating on the Epic Games Store. Here's how Frictional Games describe it:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>Left all alone in a desolate WW1 bunker with only one bullet remaining in the barrel, it’s up to you to face the oppressing terrors in the dark. Keep the lights on at all costs, persevere, and make your way out alive. A truly intense horror experience.</p>
<p>Immerse yourself in the multiple ways of tackling survival. In the shoes of the French soldier Henri Clément, you are armed with a revolver gun, a noisy dynamo flashlight, and other scarce supplies to scavenge and craft along the way. With randomization and unpredictable behavior, no play-through is the same.</p>
<p>Hunted by an ever-present threat reacting to your every move and sound, you must adapt your play-style to face hell. Every decision will change the outcome of how the game responds. Actions bear consequences.</p>
</blockquote><p>Amnesia: The Bunker usually sells for $25, but if you head over to the Epic Games Store, you can claim it for absolutely nothing between now and October 23rd. And if you're not sure if the game is worth your time, we did crown it and its sci-fi brother, SOMA, as some of the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/6-most-underrated-horror-games-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">most underrated horror games for Steam Deck</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>There’s something freeing about not having to install yet another image editor just to crop or resize a picture. Lately, I’ve been using the Image Tools suite in OmniTools, a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-open-source-web-based-graphics-editor-replaced-gimp/" target="_blank">browser-based open-source app</a> that does many of the tasks I used to need multiple apps for. It packs a full set of image editing utilities, from quick fixes like cropping to more advanced functions like background removal and color editing. And everything can be done from a browser.</p>    <p>For average users who need a quick way to take care of a variety of their editing needs, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-pay-for-adobe-acrobat-when-omnitools-is-better/" target="_blank">OmniTools is one of the best</a>. Here’s everything I’ve been loving about OmniTools’ Image Tools pack so far…</p>    <h2>
Background removal
</h2><h3>
Instant transparent backgrounds
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="OmniTools background removal tool" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/omnitools-background-removal-tool.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> One of the first tools that caught my eye when I started exploring OmniTools is the background removal feature. Most free background removers are subpar at best and often leave you with wonky edges, so I was curious whether this one would deliver. And it did. I uploaded my image that included some hair strands, which are typically more difficult to isolate from the background, and the removal was near-perfect, sans for a tiny bit of lighting that crept through.</p>    <h2>
Transparent PNG
</h2><h3>
Selectively removing colors
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="OmniTools removing green screen from image" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/omnitools-removing-green-screen-from-image-1.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Color removal is another one of those features that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-open-source-tools-for-amazing-photo-and-video-edits/" target="_blank">free editors</a> tend to fall short on, so I had to give this one a try because it’s an editing technique I actually use frequently. Transparent PNG works the same as chroma keying, which involves removing a single color to isolate a subject from the background – this is what a green screen is. As you can see, OmniTools did a decent-ish job at removing the green screen, with some pixels still peeking through. To be fair, my color selection was a little off. Overall, this is a great tool to include in a free suite.</p>    <h2>
Resize
</h2><h3>
Quick and precise
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Resizing image in OmniTools" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/resizing-image-in-omnitools.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Now onto some of OmniTools’ more basic offerings. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-resize-an-image/" target="_blank">Resizing an image</a> is something everyone needs to do from time to time, regardless of whether they’re an editor. And OmniTools makes this easier than ever. You can resize by pixels, which lets you set the height and width dimensions manually. There’s also a Maintain Aspect Ratio option here, which maintains the proportions and prevents the image from squishing or stretching. You can also resize by percentage, which is much quicker.</p>    <h2>
Cropping
</h2><h3>
Accurate framing in seconds
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Cropping image in OmniTools" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/cropping-image-in-omnitools.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Just like resizing, we all need to crop our images from time to time. OmniTools gives you a little more than just the basics here, however. After uploading your image, you can resize it manually in the editor window using the white dots. There’s also the option to shift the position of the crop (in pixels) and change the size of the crop (also in pixels). I really like that it comes with a circular crop, which is perfect for cropping headshots and social media profile pictures.</p>    <h2>
Compress image

Shrink the file size without ruining the quality
</h3>

<div>
<img alt="Compressing image in OmniTools" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/compressing-image-in-omnitools.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-file-compression-tools-windows/" target="_blank">File compression</a> is another one of those things we all need from time to time. It could be for sending images over email or optimizing them for web use. Smaller files size means faster load times and smoother sharing. OmniTools’ compressor makes this dead simple. It lets you set a max file size in megabytes, and also determine how much quality you’re willing to sacrifice – the higher the quality loss, the smaller the image. Here, it shrunk my 10MB image to 500KB without losing the integrity of the graphic.</p>    <h2>
Convert to JPG
</h2><h3>
Instantly convert to a universal format

</div>
</div>
<p> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/started-converting-all-my-files-with-open-source-tool/" target="_blank">Converting my images</a> to JPG is another thing I do almost every day. It’s perfect for online sharing since this format loads faster and is universally supported across apps and browsers. So OmniTools’ converter comes in very handy. You can drop in almost any format – WebP, PNG, TIFF – and it spits out a lightweight JPG. You can select the quality, with a lower value resulting in a smaller file size. And for transparent images, you can fill in the background with the color selector.</p>    <h2>
Image-to-text
</h2><h3>
An accurate OCR tool
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Using OCR to extract image form text in OmniTools" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/using-ocr-to-extract-image-form-text-in-omnitools.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> OCR is not a feature I expected to find in OmniTools’ Image suite. The image-to-text feature extracts text, including paragraphs, from images using optical character recognition. It’s ideal for digitizing notes, grabbing quotes, or cleaning up document scans without manually retyping. I also use OCR to pull text from informational and instructional YouTube videos. And as you can see here by the screenshot I took of this article, it’s accurate.</p>    <h2>
Image Editor
</h2><h3>
All of my basics are covered
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-682740045" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-682740045" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-682740045" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-682740045" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-682740045-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>I saved the best for last. OmniTools’ image editor is quite stripped down, but it covers everything I need for basic daily editing outside my creative projects. It has HSL sliders, so you can change the hue and brightness, and also comes with a sizable filter selection. The Watermark feature is a quick way to add my social media handle to images if necessary. My favorite feature is Annotate because it comes with drawing abilities and shapes, which makes OmniTools a bit of a graphics editor, too.</p>    <h3>
I don’t need much else
</h3>
<p>The OmniTools Image pack proves you don’t need to install heavy-duty software for images, especially if you’re only doing basic edits every day. You can do everything – resizing, converting, compressing, and even some creative edits – instantly in your browser. Finally, an online editor that actually delivers.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s something freeing about not having to install yet another image editor just to crop or resize a picture. Lately, I’ve been using the Image Tools suite in OmniTools, a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-open-source-web-based-graphics-editor-replaced-gimp/" target="_blank">browser-based open-source app</a> that does many of the tasks I used to need multiple apps for. It packs a full set of image editing utilities, from quick fixes like cropping to more advanced functions like background removal and color editing. And everything can be done from a browser.</p>    <p>For average users who need a quick way to take care of a variety of their editing needs, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-pay-for-adobe-acrobat-when-omnitools-is-better/" target="_blank">OmniTools is one of the best</a>. Here’s everything I’ve been loving about OmniTools’ Image Tools pack so far…</p>    <h2>
Background removal
</h2><h3>
Instant transparent backgrounds
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="OmniTools background removal tool" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/omnitools-background-removal-tool.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> One of the first tools that caught my eye when I started exploring OmniTools is the background removal feature. Most free background removers are subpar at best and often leave you with wonky edges, so I was curious whether this one would deliver. And it did. I uploaded my image that included some hair strands, which are typically more difficult to isolate from the background, and the removal was near-perfect, sans for a tiny bit of lighting that crept through.</p>    <h2>
Transparent PNG
</h2><h3>
Selectively removing colors
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="OmniTools removing green screen from image" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/omnitools-removing-green-screen-from-image-1.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Color removal is another one of those features that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-open-source-tools-for-amazing-photo-and-video-edits/" target="_blank">free editors</a> tend to fall short on, so I had to give this one a try because it’s an editing technique I actually use frequently. Transparent PNG works the same as chroma keying, which involves removing a single color to isolate a subject from the background – this is what a green screen is. As you can see, OmniTools did a decent-ish job at removing the green screen, with some pixels still peeking through. To be fair, my color selection was a little off. Overall, this is a great tool to include in a free suite.</p>    <h2>
Resize
</h2><h3>
Quick and precise
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Resizing image in OmniTools" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/resizing-image-in-omnitools.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Now onto some of OmniTools’ more basic offerings. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-resize-an-image/" target="_blank">Resizing an image</a> is something everyone needs to do from time to time, regardless of whether they’re an editor. And OmniTools makes this easier than ever. You can resize by pixels, which lets you set the height and width dimensions manually. There’s also a Maintain Aspect Ratio option here, which maintains the proportions and prevents the image from squishing or stretching. You can also resize by percentage, which is much quicker.</p>    <h2>
Cropping
</h2><h3>
Accurate framing in seconds
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Cropping image in OmniTools" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/cropping-image-in-omnitools.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Just like resizing, we all need to crop our images from time to time. OmniTools gives you a little more than just the basics here, however. After uploading your image, you can resize it manually in the editor window using the white dots. There’s also the option to shift the position of the crop (in pixels) and change the size of the crop (also in pixels). I really like that it comes with a circular crop, which is perfect for cropping headshots and social media profile pictures.</p>    <h2>
Compress image
</h2><h3>
Shrink the file size without ruining the quality
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Compressing image in OmniTools" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/compressing-image-in-omnitools.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-file-compression-tools-windows/" target="_blank">File compression</a> is another one of those things we all need from time to time. It could be for sending images over email or optimizing them for web use. Smaller files size means faster load times and smoother sharing. OmniTools’ compressor makes this dead simple. It lets you set a max file size in megabytes, and also determine how much quality you’re willing to sacrifice – the higher the quality loss, the smaller the image. Here, it shrunk my 10MB image to 500KB without losing the integrity of the graphic.</p>    <h2>
Convert to JPG
</h2><h3>
Instantly convert to a universal format
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="OmniTools png image to jpg in OmniTools" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/omnitools-png-image-to-jpg-in-omnitools.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/started-converting-all-my-files-with-open-source-tool/" target="_blank">Converting my images</a> to JPG is another thing I do almost every day. It’s perfect for online sharing since this format loads faster and is universally supported across apps and browsers. So OmniTools’ converter comes in very handy. You can drop in almost any format – WebP, PNG, TIFF – and it spits out a lightweight JPG. You can select the quality, with a lower value resulting in a smaller file size. And for transparent images, you can fill in the background with the color selector.</p>    <h2>
Image-to-text
</h2><h3>
An accurate OCR tool
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Using OCR to extract image form text in OmniTools" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/using-ocr-to-extract-image-form-text-in-omnitools.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> OCR is not a feature I expected to find in OmniTools’ Image suite. The image-to-text feature extracts text, including paragraphs, from images using optical character recognition. It’s ideal for digitizing notes, grabbing quotes, or cleaning up document scans without manually retyping. I also use OCR to pull text from informational and instructional YouTube videos. And as you can see here by the screenshot I took of this article, it’s accurate.</p>    <h2>
Image Editor
</h2><h3>
All of my basics are covered
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-682740045" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-682740045" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-682740045" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-682740045" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-682740045-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>I saved the best for last. OmniTools’ image editor is quite stripped down, but it covers everything I need for basic daily editing outside my creative projects. It has HSL sliders, so you can change the hue and brightness, and also comes with a sizable filter selection. The Watermark feature is a quick way to add my social media handle to images if necessary. My favorite feature is Annotate because it comes with drawing abilities and shapes, which makes OmniTools a bit of a graphics editor, too.</p>    <h3>
I don’t need much else
</h3>
<p>The OmniTools Image pack proves you don’t need to install heavy-duty software for images, especially if you’re only doing basic edits every day. You can do everything – resizing, converting, compressing, and even some creative edits – instantly in your browser. Finally, an online editor that actually delivers.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while, a big-budget game comes along that doesn't just look good, but also <em>runs</em> well. Now, on paper, that <em>should</em> just be the norm, but AAA gaming and optimized titles haven't been getting along for a while now. One rare case, however, is <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. It's Techland's long-awaited follow-up to its parkour-infused zombie series.</p>    <p>The game may not be perfect, but it's stable, consistent, and unapologetically optimized for everyone. From those still hanging on to their trusty GTX 1080s to those who are yet to move from their 20-series cards. Still, it's pretty iconic how we're at a point where this level of performance feels almost shocking. It's not praise for the industry, but <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/is-ray-tracing-even-worth-it/" target="_blank">it surely is an indictment</a>.</p>    <h2>
The Beast is a modern AAA game that just works
</h2><h3>
In today's day and age, that's a rarity
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-50920623" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-50920623" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-50920623" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-50920623" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-50920623-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The first thing you notice when booting up <em><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dying-light-the-beast-pc-review/" target="_blank">Dying Light: The Beast</a> </em>isn't its visuals, its scale, or even the much-awaited return of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/games-with-hollywood-actors-best-acting/" target="_blank">Roger Craig Smith as Kyle Crane</a>. In fact, it's how buttery smooth the game runs. Whether you're playing on PC, PS5, or the Series X, the game maintains steady frame rates with almost no dips, stutters, or shader compilation hiccups. On my PC, it booted up quickly, detected the hardware properly, and offered a surprisingly generous amount of graphics options. All of this actually makes a difference.</p>    <p>Techland's decision not to chase the ray tracing craze right out of the gate deserves some serious applause, here. Like <em>Atomic Heart </em>before it, <em>The Beast </em>instead opts for a clean, well-lit presentation that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ray-tracing-not-nvidia-killer-usp-anymore/" target="_blank">doesn't hinge on RTX reflections</a> or shadows to look atmospheric. Instead, it relies on strong texture work, careful lighting design, and dynamic weather systems to make its world come alive. You'd be surprised how much of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/upcoming-next-gen-games/" target="_blank">that "next-gen look"</a> you can achieve without nuking performance just to show off fancy reflections in puddles.</p>    <h2>
Forgoing ray-tracing is a huge reason for the game's great performance
</h2><h3>
Paired with impressive optimization, The Beast scales incredibly well across older-generation GPUs
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-2065535091" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-2065535091" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-2065535091" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-2065535091" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-2065535091-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Ray tracing may sound like <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-promises-2x-performance-with-next-gen-ray-tracing/" target="_blank">the holy grail of modern graphics</a>, but it's still an expensive, power-hungry luxury that <em>very few</em> players can actually afford to enable. In contrast, <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>feels like a statement which reads, "you don't need cutting-edge lighting tech to look cutting-edge." That's a gutsy stance for a game this ambitious.</p>    <p>By forgoing ray tracing for now, Techland has ensured that <em>The Beast </em>would scale gracefully across a whole range of systems. In a year when AAA releases like <em><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/worst-unreal-engine-5-games-in-2025/" target="_blank">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> </em>and <em>Borderlands 4 </em>have not been kind even to the latest 50-series cards and flagship GPUs, <em>The Beast </em>runs incredibly well even on mid-tier GPUs like the RTX 2060 or the RX 5700 XT. Heck, even on a 1660 Ti, the game manages to deliver close to 60fps on low settings with FSR (since the card doesn't support DLSS).</p>    <p>Rasterized graphics in 2025 are incredible, and clearly, they have only gotten better with time. The ray tracing tax is incredibly hard to justify, as it has always been, and there are <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/games-that-justify-ray-tracing-tax/" target="_blank">only a handful of games</a> today that truly make <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-ray-tracing-isnt-worth-performance-hit/" target="_blank">the performance cost</a> worth it.</p>    <h2>
Praising the game still feels ironic, sadly
</h2><h3>
I love how well it runs, but shouldn't it be the norm?
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-1313229685" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-1313229685" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-1313229685" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-1313229685" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-1313229685-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Let's be honest, though — we've collectively lowered our standards. The industry lately has conditioned players to expect day one patches, stuttering frame rates, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/borderlands-4-why-we-need-stop-making-excuses-buggy-launches/" target="_blank">broken PC ports</a> that compile shaders at the cost of horrible 1% lows, and constant hotfixes just to make the games we paid full price for <em>function</em>. So when something like <em>The Beast </em>arrives and simply runs without imploding, it feels... revolutionary?</p>    <p>It shouldn't be. This is (and should be) the <em>bare minimum</em>.</p>    <p>And yet, here we are, applauding a studio for doing something that, a decade ago, was standard practice. Remember when games launched and you could just play them? No 90GB patch, no <a href="https://gamerant.com/open-world-games-with-longest-development-time/" target="_blank">three-year-long roadmap</a> for ironing out bugs and glitches and improving performance? The new <em>Dying Light </em>game does evoke that old-school confidence, and that alone makes it feel special. It's a polished product on day one, which is a rarity in today's day and age.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>The Beast's optimization says more about the state of modern gaming than it does about Techland's brilliance.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>Here's the bittersweet truth: the fact that <em>The Beast</em>'s optimization feels like a breath of fresh air says more about the state of modern gaming than it does about Techland's brilliance. We've set the bar so low that "a game that runs properly and doesn't render old PCs obsolete" is now headline-worthy. Yes, the game absolutely deserves its praise, but it also exposes <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gaming-trends-that-need-to-end-in-2025/" target="_blank">how complacent the industry has become</a>.</p>    <p>We shouldn't be surprised when a big game launches smoothly. Instead, we should <em>expect </em>it. And yet, in a market riddled with technical disasters, <em>The Beast</em> feels like an act of rebellion.</p>    <h2>
Optimization feels like a lost art, but Techland has quietly mastered it
</h2><h3>
Beautiful where it needs to be, efficient where it can be
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-4-818070932" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-4-818070932" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-4-818070932" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-4-818070932" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-4-818070932-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Techland has always understood that performance is part of immersion. Even on a terribly under-powered HP laptop that I got in 2013 for college, the first <em>Dying Light </em>game ran at 30fps when I plugged that aging thing in. It really shouldn't have run at all, but it did, and that was my first playthrough of a brilliant game that eventually made its way on to my Mount Rushmore, becoming the one I've played <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/most-replayable-games-i-will-never-get-tired-of-playing/" target="_blank">a whopping seven times over</a>.</p>    <p>That same DNA is evident in <em>Dying Light:</em> <em>The Beast</em>. It doesn't have the <em>most</em> photorealistic environments or the densest zombie hordes, but every design decision here feels deliberate. The lighting engine is tuned to give you depth without dependency on heavy rendering techniques. Shadows are believable but still manage to remain efficient. Textures are sharp where they need to be, and very cleverly masked where they don't, outside of the occasional square-shaped blood pool.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>When good art direction does the heavy lifting, ray-tracing isn't needed to sell the illusion.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>It's the game's dynamic time-of-day and weather system that make it feel alive, and that effect is delivered not through technical ray-tracing wizardry, but because it's balanced to <em>feel natural</em>. When the orange glow of dusk hits the city nested in a valley in the European Alps? That's when you realize full well that ray-tracing was never needed to sell the illusion. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-art-styles-games/" target="_blank">Just good art direction</a> which does the heavy lifting, and that's something I'm sad too many modern developers forget.</p>

More AAA titles should forgo ray-tracing

</section><p> <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> doesn't reinvent the wheel. It just remembers how to make one that rolls perfectly straight. It's stable, scalable, and technically confident in ways that most AAA games aren't anymore. By skipping ray tracing and focusing on optimization, they've created a game that runs beautifully across the board, and ironically, gets way more praise just by not being like the rest of the titles in the AAA blanket.</p>    <p>If it takes a game without ray tracing to remind everyone of how far rasterization has come and how it comes with benefits of scalability across older PCs as well, then maybe it's time the rest of the industry stopped chasing reflections and started chasing results.</p>]]>

    <description>
      <![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while, a big-budget game comes along that doesn't just look good, but also <em>runs</em> well. Now, on paper, that <em>should</em> just be the norm, but AAA gaming and optimized titles haven't been getting along for a while now. One rare case, however, is <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. It's Techland's long-awaited follow-up to its parkour-infused zombie series.</p>    <p>The game may not be perfect, but it's stable, consistent, and unapologetically optimized for everyone. From those still hanging on to their trusty GTX 1080s to those who are yet to move from their 20-series cards. Still, it's pretty iconic how we're at a point where this level of performance feels almost shocking. It's not praise for the industry, but <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/is-ray-tracing-even-worth-it/" target="_blank">it surely is an indictment</a>.</p>    <h2>
The Beast is a modern AAA game that just works
</h2><h3>
In today's day and age, that's a rarity
</h3>

<p>The first thing you notice when booting up <em><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dying-light-the-beast-pc-review/" target="_blank">Dying Light: The Beast</a> </em>isn't its visuals, its scale, or even the much-awaited return of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/games-with-hollywood-actors-best-acting/" target="_blank">Roger Craig Smith as Kyle Crane</a>. In fact, it's how buttery smooth the game runs. Whether you're playing on PC, PS5, or the Series X, the game maintains steady frame rates with almost no dips, stutters, or shader compilation hiccups. On my PC, it booted up quickly, detected the hardware properly, and offered a surprisingly generous amount of graphics options. All of this actually makes a difference.</p>    <p>Techland's decision not to chase the ray tracing craze right out of the gate deserves some serious applause, here. Like <em>Atomic Heart </em>before it, <em>The Beast </em>instead opts for a clean, well-lit presentation that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ray-tracing-not-nvidia-killer-usp-anymore/" target="_blank">doesn't hinge on RTX reflections</a> or shadows to look atmospheric. Instead, it relies on strong texture work, careful lighting design, and dynamic weather systems to make its world come alive. You'd be surprised how much of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/upcoming-next-gen-games/" target="_blank">that "next-gen look"</a> you can achieve without nuking performance just to show off fancy reflections in puddles.</p>    <h2>
Forgoing ray-tracing is a huge reason for the game's great performance
</h2><h3>
Paired with impressive optimization, The Beast scales incredibly well across older-generation GPUs
</h3>

</div>
<p>Ray tracing may sound like <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-promises-2x-performance-with-next-gen-ray-tracing/" target="_blank">the holy grail of modern graphics</a>, but it's still an expensive, power-hungry luxury that <em>very few</em> players can actually afford to enable. In contrast, <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>feels like a statement which reads, "you don't need cutting-edge lighting tech to look cutting-edge." That's a gutsy stance for a game this ambitious.</p>    <p>By forgoing ray tracing for now, Techland has ensured that <em>The Beast </em>would scale gracefully across a whole range of systems. In a year when AAA releases like <em><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/worst-unreal-engine-5-games-in-2025/" target="_blank">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> </em>and <em>Borderlands 4 </em>have not been kind even to the latest 50-series cards and flagship GPUs, <em>The Beast </em>runs incredibly well even on mid-tier GPUs like the RTX 2060 or the RX 5700 XT. Heck, even on a 1660 Ti, the game manages to deliver close to 60fps on low settings with FSR (since the card doesn't support DLSS).</p>    <p>Rasterized graphics in 2025 are incredible, and clearly, they have only gotten better with time. The ray tracing tax is incredibly hard to justify, as it has always been, and there are <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/games-that-justify-ray-tracing-tax/" target="_blank">only a handful of games</a> today that truly make <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-ray-tracing-isnt-worth-performance-hit/" target="_blank">the performance cost</a> worth it.</p>    <h2>
Praising the game still feels ironic, sadly
</h2><h3>
I love how well it runs, but shouldn't it be the norm?
</h3>

<p>Let's be honest, though — we've collectively lowered our standards. The industry lately has conditioned players to expect day one patches, stuttering frame rates, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/borderlands-4-why-we-need-stop-making-excuses-buggy-launches/" target="_blank">broken PC ports</a> that compile shaders at the cost of horrible 1% lows, and constant hotfixes just to make the games we paid full price for <em>function</em>. So when something like <em>The Beast </em>arrives and simply runs without imploding, it feels... revolutionary?</p>    <p>It shouldn't be. This is (and should be) the <em>bare minimum</em>.</p>    <p>And yet, here we are, applauding a studio for doing something that, a decade ago, was standard practice. Remember when games launched and you could just play them? No 90GB patch, no <a href="https://gamerant.com/open-world-games-with-longest-development-time/" target="_blank">three-year-long roadmap</a> for ironing out bugs and glitches and improving performance? The new <em>Dying Light </em>game does evoke that old-school confidence, and that alone makes it feel special. It's a polished product on day one, which is a rarity in today's day and age.</p>

</div>
</section><p>Here's the bittersweet truth: the fact that <em>The Beast</em>'s optimization feels like a breath of fresh air says more about the state of modern gaming than it does about Techland's brilliance. We've set the bar so low that "a game that runs properly and doesn't render old PCs obsolete" is now headline-worthy. Yes, the game absolutely deserves its praise, but it also exposes <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gaming-trends-that-need-to-end-in-2025/" target="_blank">how complacent the industry has become</a>.</p>    <p>We shouldn't be surprised when a big game launches smoothly. Instead, we should <em>expect </em>it. And yet, in a market riddled with technical disasters, <em>The Beast</em> feels like an act of rebellion.</p>    <h2>
Optimization feels like a lost art, but Techland has quietly mastered it
</h2><h3>
Beautiful where it needs to be, efficient where it can be
</h3>

<p>Techland has always understood that performance is part of immersion. Even on a terribly under-powered HP laptop that I got in 2013 for college, the first <em>Dying Light </em>game ran at 30fps when I plugged that aging thing in. It really shouldn't have run at all, but it did, and that was my first playthrough of a brilliant game that eventually made its way on to my Mount Rushmore, becoming the one I've played <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/most-replayable-games-i-will-never-get-tired-of-playing/" target="_blank">a whopping seven times over</a>.</p>    <p>That same DNA is evident in <em>Dying Light:</em> <em>The Beast</em>. It doesn't have the <em>most</em> photorealistic environments or the densest zombie hordes, but every design decision here feels deliberate. The lighting engine is tuned to give you depth without dependency on heavy rendering techniques. Shadows are believable but still manage to remain efficient. Textures are sharp where they need to be, and very cleverly masked where they don't, outside of the occasional square-shaped blood pool.</p>

<div><p>When good art direction does the heavy lifting, ray-tracing isn't needed to sell the illusion.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>It's the game's dynamic time-of-day and weather system that make it feel alive, and that effect is delivered not through technical ray-tracing wizardry, but because it's balanced to <em>feel natural</em>. When the orange glow of dusk hits the city nested in a valley in the European Alps? That's when you realize full well that ray-tracing was never needed to sell the illusion. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-art-styles-games/" target="_blank">Just good art direction</a> which does the heavy lifting, and that's something I'm sad too many modern developers forget.</p>

More AAA titles should forgo ray-tracing

</div>
</section><p> <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> doesn't reinvent the wheel. It just remembers how to make one that rolls perfectly straight. It's stable, scalable, and technically confident in ways that most AAA games aren't anymore. By skipping ray tracing and focusing on optimization, they've created a game that runs beautifully across the board, and ironically, gets way more praise just by not being like the rest of the titles in the AAA blanket.</p>    <p>If it takes a game without ray tracing to remind everyone of how far rasterization has come and how it comes with benefits of scalability across older PCs as well, then maybe it's time the rest of the industry stopped chasing reflections and started chasing results.</p>]]>
    </description>
    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while, a big-budget game comes along that doesn't just look good, but also <em>runs</em> well. Now, on paper, that <em>should</em> just be the norm, but AAA gaming and optimized titles haven't been getting along for a while now. One rare case, however, is <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. It's Techland's long-awaited follow-up to its parkour-infused zombie series.</p>    <p>The game may not be perfect, but it's stable, consistent, and unapologetically optimized for everyone. From those still hanging on to their trusty GTX 1080s to those who are yet to move from their 20-series cards. Still, it's pretty iconic how we're at a point where this level of performance feels almost shocking. It's not praise for the industry, but <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/is-ray-tracing-even-worth-it/" target="_blank">it surely is an indictment</a>.</p>    <h2>
The Beast is a modern AAA game that just works
</h2><h3>
In today's day and age, that's a rarity
</h3>

<p>The first thing you notice when booting up <em><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dying-light-the-beast-pc-review/" target="_blank">Dying Light: The Beast</a> </em>isn't its visuals, its scale, or even the much-awaited return of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/games-with-hollywood-actors-best-acting/" target="_blank">Roger Craig Smith as Kyle Crane</a>. In fact, it's how buttery smooth the game runs. Whether you're playing on PC, PS5, or the Series X, the game maintains steady frame rates with almost no dips, stutters, or shader compilation hiccups. On my PC, it booted up quickly, detected the hardware properly, and offered a surprisingly generous amount of graphics options. All of this actually makes a difference.</p>    <p>Techland's decision not to chase the ray tracing craze right out of the gate deserves some serious applause, here. Like <em>Atomic Heart </em>before it, <em>The Beast </em>instead opts for a clean, well-lit presentation that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ray-tracing-not-nvidia-killer-usp-anymore/" target="_blank">doesn't hinge on RTX reflections</a> or shadows to look atmospheric. Instead, it relies on strong texture work, careful lighting design, and dynamic weather systems to make its world come alive. You'd be surprised how much of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/upcoming-next-gen-games/" target="_blank">that "next-gen look"</a> you can achieve without nuking performance just to show off fancy reflections in puddles.</p>    <h2>
Forgoing ray-tracing is a huge reason for the game's great performance
</h2><h3>
Paired with impressive optimization, The Beast scales incredibly well across older-generation GPUs
</h3>

<p>Ray tracing may sound like <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-promises-2x-performance-with-next-gen-ray-tracing/" target="_blank">the holy grail of modern graphics</a>, but it's still an expensive, power-hungry luxury that <em>very few</em> players can actually afford to enable. In contrast, <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>feels like a statement which reads, "you don't need cutting-edge lighting tech to look cutting-edge." That's a gutsy stance for a game this ambitious.</p>    <p>By forgoing ray tracing for now, Techland has ensured that <em>The Beast </em>would scale gracefully across a whole range of systems. In a year when AAA releases like <em><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/worst-unreal-engine-5-games-in-2025/" target="_blank">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> </em>and <em>Borderlands 4 </em>have not been kind even to the latest 50-series cards and flagship GPUs, <em>The Beast </em>runs incredibly well even on mid-tier GPUs like the RTX 2060 or the RX 5700 XT. Heck, even on a 1660 Ti, the game manages to deliver close to 60fps on low settings with FSR (since the card doesn't support DLSS).</p>    <p>Rasterized graphics in 2025 are incredible, and clearly, they have only gotten better with time. The ray tracing tax is incredibly hard to justify, as it has always been, and there are <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/games-that-justify-ray-tracing-tax/" target="_blank">only a handful of games</a> today that truly make <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-ray-tracing-isnt-worth-performance-hit/" target="_blank">the performance cost</a> worth it.</p>    <h2>
Praising the game still feels ironic, sadly
</h2><h3>
I love how well it runs, but shouldn't it be the norm?
</h3>

<p>Let's be honest, though — we've collectively lowered our standards. The industry lately has conditioned players to expect day one patches, stuttering frame rates, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/borderlands-4-why-we-need-stop-making-excuses-buggy-launches/" target="_blank">broken PC ports</a> that compile shaders at the cost of horrible 1% lows, and constant hotfixes just to make the games we paid full price for <em>function</em>. So when something like <em>The Beast </em>arrives and simply runs without imploding, it feels... revolutionary?</p>    <p>It shouldn't be. This is (and should be) the <em>bare minimum</em>.</p>    <p>And yet, here we are, applauding a studio for doing something that, a decade ago, was standard practice. Remember when games launched and you could just play them? No 90GB patch, no <a href="https://gamerant.com/open-world-games-with-longest-development-time/" target="_blank">three-year-long roadmap</a> for ironing out bugs and glitches and improving performance? The new <em>Dying Light </em>game does evoke that old-school confidence, and that alone makes it feel special. It's a polished product on day one, which is a rarity in today's day and age.</p>

</div>
</section><p>Here's the bittersweet truth: the fact that <em>The Beast</em>'s optimization feels like a breath of fresh air says more about the state of modern gaming than it does about Techland's brilliance. We've set the bar so low that "a game that runs properly and doesn't render old PCs obsolete" is now headline-worthy. Yes, the game absolutely deserves its praise, but it also exposes <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gaming-trends-that-need-to-end-in-2025/" target="_blank">how complacent the industry has become</a>.</p>    <p>We shouldn't be surprised when a big game launches smoothly. Instead, we should <em>expect </em>it. And yet, in a market riddled with technical disasters, <em>The Beast</em> feels like an act of rebellion.</p>    <h2>
Optimization feels like a lost art, but Techland has quietly mastered it
</h2><h3>
Beautiful where it needs to be, efficient where it can be
</h3>

<p>Techland has always understood that performance is part of immersion. Even on a terribly under-powered HP laptop that I got in 2013 for college, the first <em>Dying Light </em>game ran at 30fps when I plugged that aging thing in. It really shouldn't have run at all, but it did, and that was my first playthrough of a brilliant game that eventually made its way on to my Mount Rushmore, becoming the one I've played <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/most-replayable-games-i-will-never-get-tired-of-playing/" target="_blank">a whopping seven times over</a>.</p>    <p>That same DNA is evident in <em>Dying Light:</em> <em>The Beast</em>. It doesn't have the <em>most</em> photorealistic environments or the densest zombie hordes, but every design decision here feels deliberate. The lighting engine is tuned to give you depth without dependency on heavy rendering techniques. Shadows are believable but still manage to remain efficient. Textures are sharp where they need to be, and very cleverly masked where they don't, outside of the occasional square-shaped blood pool.</p>

<div><p>When good art direction does the heavy lifting, ray-tracing isn't needed to sell the illusion.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>It's the game's dynamic time-of-day and weather system that make it feel alive, and that effect is delivered not through technical ray-tracing wizardry, but because it's balanced to <em>feel natural</em>. When the orange glow of dusk hits the city nested in a valley in the European Alps? That's when you realize full well that ray-tracing was never needed to sell the illusion. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-art-styles-games/" target="_blank">Just good art direction</a> which does the heavy lifting, and that's something I'm sad too many modern developers forget.</p>

More AAA titles should forgo ray-tracing

</section><p> <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> doesn't reinvent the wheel. It just remembers how to make one that rolls perfectly straight. It's stable, scalable, and technically confident in ways that most AAA games aren't anymore. By skipping ray tracing and focusing on optimization, they've created a game that runs beautifully across the board, and ironically, gets way more praise just by not being like the rest of the titles in the AAA blanket.</p>    <p>If it takes a game without ray tracing to remind everyone of how far rasterization has come and how it comes with benefits of scalability across older PCs as well, then maybe it's time the rest of the industry stopped chasing reflections and started chasing results.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>Proxmox may have developed a massive following in the home server community, but this virtualization platform is just as powerful for enterprise-grade workloads. After all, Proxmox’s killer performance and KVM support are only a small subset of its features, with its advanced SDN stack, high-availability clusters, and compatibility with automation tools being super useful for business and DevOps-centric tasks.</p>    <p>Better yet, there are a handful of seemingly complex features that can even aid your casual PVE home lab. Having used Proxmox for a long time, here are the best settings, toggles, and tweaks that made my home server more reliable and foolproof.</p>    <h2>
Use RAID-powered ZFS pools
</h2><h3>
To add redundancy to my PVE setup
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Creating a new ZFS pool in Proxmox" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/proxmox-zfs-2.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Proxmox uses ext4 as the file system for the storage pools, and while it’s not bad by any means, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-always-use-zfs-on-my-nas-and-home-lab-servers-for-this-reason/" target="_blank">ZFS</a> is clearly superior for server tasks. Sure, this beast of a file system requires more RAM to satisfy its RAM-devouring tendencies. But ZFS’ checksumming capabilities and Copy-on-Write design make it a lot more reliable for storing virtual guest data. That’s before you consider ZFS’ terrific support for RAID setups.</p>    <p>Now, RAID isn’t meant to replace proper backups (and I’ll go over those in a bit). Instead, it’s a neat way to add more redundancy to a Proxmox workstation using spare drives. Me? As much as I prefer RAID 10, I’ve only got three 2TB hard drives to work with. As such, I use the next best thing – RAIDZ 1 – to make my primary PVE node more reliable. If that sounds unfamiliar, RAIDZ 1 is pretty much equivalent to a conventional RAID 5 setup, minus the write hole problem.</p>    <h2>
Configure Log2Ram on the boot SSD
</h2><h3>
Write amplification can be a silent killer
</h3>

<p>Although I rely on hard drives for VMs and LXCs that require a lot of data, I prefer SSDs for my boot drives and virtual guests where I need performance over all else. My Windows and Arch Linux dev virtual machines are a good example of the latter, as I’d rather not deal with extra latency brought by hard drives. Unfortunately, SSDs carry the scourge called write amplification, which results in excessive write operations. Over time, this can degrade the lifespan of your SSDs, making solutions like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/disable-these-services-to-prevent-wearing-out-your-proxmox-boot-drive/" target="_blank">Log2Ram</a> a godsend if you’re as paranoid about your home lab’s health as I am.</p>    <p>True to its name, Log2Ram saves log files generated by your PVE server to the memory and routinely transfers them to the drives. That way, the host machine doesn’t constantly write logs to the SSDs. Sure, write amplification may not be as big of an issue on premium SSDs, but since I plan to use my Proxmox server for another decade, I’d rather use Log2Ram to preserve the lifespans of my SSDs.</p>    <h2>
Run a monitoring server 24/7
</h2><h3>
On a low-power Raspberry Pi, of course
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1819396580" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1819396580" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1819396580" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1819396580" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1819396580-img" data-gallery-type="">

<p>I use Proxmox for a variety of reasons, and learning about virtualization, networking, and DevOps projects is one of them. Unfortunately, I’ve had my fair share of projects where a dumb mistake in a config file caused my virtual guests (and even the host, in some cases) to become inaccessible. Throw in the fact that container updates can break my self-hosted application stack, and a monitoring hub becomes a must-have for my home lab.</p>    <p>Pulse is my favorite monitoring application for Proxmox, as it meshes really well with the virtualization platform. Once you connect it with a PVE host, Pulse can pull the uptime, network, and detailed resource utilization statistics from your virtual guests and display them on its sleek interface. Likewise, you can pair your Proxmox Backup Server with Pulse to create a detailed log of your snapshot tasks. It’s also capable of sending alerts to a notification server, and I use it with Gotify to receive pings whenever my self-hosted services go down. Since I don’t want my Pulse monitoring hub to become inaccessible with the rest of my PVE virtual guests, I host it on a Raspberry Pi instead of running it on my Proxmox server.</p>    <h2>
Deploy Proxmox Backup Server
</h2><h3>
And create remote sync tasks
</h3>

<p>Even without a PBS instance, Proxmox can still back up VM and LXC data, and even send it to NAS shares and remote devices. However, Proxmox Backup Server adds some useful features that make it worth deploying. The incremental nature of backups created via PBS makes them fairly small, while the compression and deduplication provisions offered by Proxmox’s companion platform limit the amount of space hogged by my snapshots.</p>    <p>Recovering files from a Proxmox Backup Server is also pretty quick, thanks to the granular restore and live recovery facilities offered by the platform. Since PBS supports remote sync jobs, it can add more redundancy in the form of 3-2-1 backup schedules.</p>    <h3>

</div>
<p>Besides these software tweaks, I’ve also made some changes in the underlying hardware to make my Proxmox hub more reliable. Since my server supports <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ecc-ram-guide/" target="_blank">ECC memory</a>, I’ve ditched conventional RAM sticks. This may seem somewhat overkill considering the higher cost of ECC RAM kits, but I’d rather spend extra to protect my home server from bit rot. My backwater town also has frequent blackouts, so a UPS is essential for my Proxmox and NAS nodes.</p>    <p>If you’re willing to shell out some money on extra hardware, a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-clustered-cheap-devices-into-a-proxmox-ha-lab/" target="_blank">high-availability cluster</a> can add even more reliability to your Proxmox setup. I recently built one using some old systems I had lying around, and while the nodes don’t have enough horsepower to run multiple VMs, the cluster works pretty well for my LXC collection.</p>]]>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Proxmox may have developed a massive following in the home server community, but this virtualization platform is just as powerful for enterprise-grade workloads. After all, Proxmox’s killer performance and KVM support are only a small subset of its features, with its advanced SDN stack, high-availability clusters, and compatibility with automation tools being super useful for business and DevOps-centric tasks.</p>    <p>Better yet, there are a handful of seemingly complex features that can even aid your casual PVE home lab. Having used Proxmox for a long time, here are the best settings, toggles, and tweaks that made my home server more reliable and foolproof.</p>    <h2>
Use RAID-powered ZFS pools
</h2><h3>
To add redundancy to my PVE setup
</h3>
<div>
<div>

<p>Proxmox uses ext4 as the file system for the storage pools, and while it’s not bad by any means, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-always-use-zfs-on-my-nas-and-home-lab-servers-for-this-reason/" target="_blank">ZFS</a> is clearly superior for server tasks. Sure, this beast of a file system requires more RAM to satisfy its RAM-devouring tendencies. But ZFS’ checksumming capabilities and Copy-on-Write design make it a lot more reliable for storing virtual guest data. That’s before you consider ZFS’ terrific support for RAID setups.</p>    <p>Now, RAID isn’t meant to replace proper backups (and I’ll go over those in a bit). Instead, it’s a neat way to add more redundancy to a Proxmox workstation using spare drives. Me? As much as I prefer RAID 10, I’ve only got three 2TB hard drives to work with. As such, I use the next best thing – RAIDZ 1 – to make my primary PVE node more reliable. If that sounds unfamiliar, RAIDZ 1 is pretty much equivalent to a conventional RAID 5 setup, minus the write hole problem.</p>    <h2>
Configure Log2Ram on the boot SSD
</h2><h3>
Write amplification can be a silent killer
</h3>

<p>Although I rely on hard drives for VMs and LXCs that require a lot of data, I prefer SSDs for my boot drives and virtual guests where I need performance over all else. My Windows and Arch Linux dev virtual machines are a good example of the latter, as I’d rather not deal with extra latency brought by hard drives. Unfortunately, SSDs carry the scourge called write amplification, which results in excessive write operations. Over time, this can degrade the lifespan of your SSDs, making solutions like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/disable-these-services-to-prevent-wearing-out-your-proxmox-boot-drive/" target="_blank">Log2Ram</a> a godsend if you’re as paranoid about your home lab’s health as I am.</p>    <p>True to its name, Log2Ram saves log files generated by your PVE server to the memory and routinely transfers them to the drives. That way, the host machine doesn’t constantly write logs to the SSDs. Sure, write amplification may not be as big of an issue on premium SSDs, but since I plan to use my Proxmox server for another decade, I’d rather use Log2Ram to preserve the lifespans of my SSDs.</p>    <h2>
Run a monitoring server 24/7
</h2><h3>
On a low-power Raspberry Pi, of course
</h3>

<p>I use Proxmox for a variety of reasons, and learning about virtualization, networking, and DevOps projects is one of them. Unfortunately, I’ve had my fair share of projects where a dumb mistake in a config file caused my virtual guests (and even the host, in some cases) to become inaccessible. Throw in the fact that container updates can break my self-hosted application stack, and a monitoring hub becomes a must-have for my home lab.</p>    <p>Pulse is my favorite monitoring application for Proxmox, as it meshes really well with the virtualization platform. Once you connect it with a PVE host, Pulse can pull the uptime, network, and detailed resource utilization statistics from your virtual guests and display them on its sleek interface. Likewise, you can pair your Proxmox Backup Server with Pulse to create a detailed log of your snapshot tasks. It’s also capable of sending alerts to a notification server, and I use it with Gotify to receive pings whenever my self-hosted services go down. Since I don’t want my Pulse monitoring hub to become inaccessible with the rest of my PVE virtual guests, I host it on a Raspberry Pi instead of running it on my Proxmox server.</p>    <h2>
Deploy Proxmox Backup Server
</h2><h3>
And create remote sync tasks
</h3>

<p>Even without a PBS instance, Proxmox can still back up VM and LXC data, and even send it to NAS shares and remote devices. However, Proxmox Backup Server adds some useful features that make it worth deploying. The incremental nature of backups created via PBS makes them fairly small, while the compression and deduplication provisions offered by Proxmox’s companion platform limit the amount of space hogged by my snapshots.</p>    <p>Recovering files from a Proxmox Backup Server is also pretty quick, thanks to the granular restore and live recovery facilities offered by the platform. Since PBS supports remote sync jobs, it can add more redundancy in the form of 3-2-1 backup schedules.</p>    <h3>

<p>Besides these software tweaks, I’ve also made some changes in the underlying hardware to make my Proxmox hub more reliable.

This may seem somewhat overkill considering the higher cost of ECC RAM kits, but I’d rather spend extra to protect my home server from bit rot.
