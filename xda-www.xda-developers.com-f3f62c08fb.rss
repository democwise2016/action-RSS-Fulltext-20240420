      <![CDATA[<p>What's better than a party game? A party game you can play both online <em>and</em> locally, of course. No matter if your friends are on your sofa or are "so-fa" away from you, you can still play a round whenever you like.</p>    <p>Well, if you're hankering for a new way to test your friendship, why not give Ultimate Chicken Horse a try? Not only is it a blast with your friends, but it's currently 65% off on Steam, bringing the price down to an impressive $5.24.</p>    <h2>
Why Ultimate Chicken Horse is a great pick for you and your friends
</h2>
<p>So here's the premise for Ultimate Chicken Horse. Once you and your friends have been assigned a woodland creature to play as, you begin building a stage. The goal is to go from the start to the flag. Sounds easy? Well, yes, it is; that's why it's your job to lay traps along the path.</p>    <p><span>You may be tempted to make the stage impossible to beat, but the rub is that <em>you</em> also have to play and complete the level. If everyone falls prey to traps, nobody scores a point. Similarly, if <em>nobody</em> perishes, nobody scores a point. You have to strike a precise balance where it's just easy enough that you can beat it, but hard enough that nobody else can. And once you figure out the perfect solution, you have to protect your design from your annoyed friends, as they do everything in their power to ruin your setup.Here's how the devs describe the game:</span></p>    <blockquote>
<p>Ever wish you were a wall-jumping, arrow-dodging, trap-setting horse, besting your animal pals in a race through a peril-laden obstacle course that you all built together?</p>
<p>Wish Granted!</p>
<p>Ultimate Chicken Horse is a party platformer where you and your friends build the level as you play, placing deadly traps before trying to reach the end of the level. If you can make it but your friends can't, you score points! Play online or locally with your animal buddies and experiment with a wide variety of platforms in all sorts of strange locations to find new ways to mess with your friends.</p>
</blockquote><p>Ultimate Chicken Horse is currently 65% off on Steam for $5.29. As I <span>mentioned earlier, it features both couch co-op and online play modes for friends of all distances; however, it <em>also</em> supports crossplay, allowing you to play with friends who already own it on a different console</span>. Be sure to snag it before the deal expires on October 20th, and check out <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pc-games-perfect-play-lan-party/" target="_blank">these other PC games that are perfect to play at a LAN party</a>.</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What's better than a party game? A party game you can play both online <em>and</em> locally, of course. No matter if your friends are on your sofa or are "so-fa" away from you, you can still play a round whenever you like.</p>    <p>Well, if you're hankering for a new way to test your friendship, why not give Ultimate Chicken Horse a try? Not only is it a blast with your friends, but it's currently 65% off on Steam, bringing the price down to an impressive $5.24.</p>    <h2>
Why Ultimate Chicken Horse is a great pick for you and your friends
</h2>
<p>So here's the premise for Ultimate Chicken Horse. Once you and your friends have been assigned a woodland creature to play as, you begin building a stage. The goal is to go from the start to the flag. Sounds easy? Well, yes, it is; that's why it's your job to lay traps along the path.</p>    <p><span>You may be tempted to make the stage impossible to beat, but the rub is that <em>you</em> also have to play and complete the level. If everyone falls prey to traps, nobody scores a point. Similarly, if <em>nobody</em> perishes, nobody scores a point. You have to strike a precise balance where it's just easy enough that you can beat it, but hard enough that nobody else can. And once you figure out the perfect solution, you have to protect your design from your annoyed friends, as they do everything in their power to ruin your setup.Here's how the devs describe the game:</span></p>    <blockquote>
<p>Ever wish you were a wall-jumping, arrow-dodging, trap-setting horse, besting your animal pals in a race through a peril-laden obstacle course that you all built together?</p>
<p>Wish Granted!</p>
<p>Ultimate Chicken Horse is a party platformer where you and your friends build the level as you play, placing deadly traps before trying to reach the end of the level. If you can make it but your friends can't, you score points! Play online or locally with your animal buddies and experiment with a wide variety of platforms in all sorts of strange locations to find new ways to mess with your friends.</p>
</blockquote><p>Ultimate Chicken Horse is currently 65% off on Steam for $5.29. As I <span>mentioned earlier, it features both couch co-op and online play modes for friends of all distances; however, it <em>also</em> supports crossplay, allowing you to play with friends who already own it on a different console</span>. Be sure to snag it before the deal expires on October 20th, and check out <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pc-games-perfect-play-lan-party/" target="_blank">these other PC games that are perfect to play at a LAN party</a>.</p>

Windows hints at a Cortana-like comeback for Windows 11 with a reveal set for Thursday.

Copilot-era AI could make voice control truly useful, but I'm skeptical it will catch on.

After Vista's flop, I doubt voice UIs will replace keyboards anytime soon.

<p>So, a brief bit of context. If you were around during the Windows Vista days, you'll know of Cortana. And if you know of Cortana, you'll know how much Microsoft pushed to make it a voice-controlled tool for your operating system. The idea was that you didn't have to touch your keyboard or mouse; you just said "Hey Cortana" and then told her what you wanted to do.</p>    <p>Of course, back then, the modern-day LLM version of AI was a ways off, so you only had some pre-set commands you could do. And as you might imagine, it fell off, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief and went back to using their keyboards.</p>    <p>Now that you know the context of my dread, check out this random X post from the Windows account for no reason whatsoever:</p>
<p>I mean, it has to be, right? It has to be a second shot at Microsoft's dream to have us all arguing with our computers to get it to do what we want it to do. We have the technology to do it, too; with the rise of AI LLMs like Copilot, you no longer have to speak an exact command to get something done. In theory, you could describe what you <em>want</em> to do and have Copilot figure out how to achieve it on its own.</p>    <p>Do we have the technology for a Cortana-like system that will actually do its job properly this time? Absolutely. Will it take off? Don't count on it. I don't think, after all these years, we've warmed to the concept of talking to our computers any more than we have during our Vista years.

Windows hints at a Cortana-like comeback for Windows 11 with a reveal set for Thursday.

Copilot-era AI could make voice control truly useful, but I'm skeptical it will catch on.

<p>When you move from Windows to Linux, you'll need to do a little bit of working out what can stay and what can go. Some of the apps you like using on Windows have a Linux version that works perfectly; others will work, but not as well. And others still won't have a Linux version, meaning you'll need to find an alternative.</p>    <p>From my personal experience, I had an easier time finding Linux versions of my favorite apps when I was on a Debian-based system. If developers create a Linux version, it typically includes a DEB package, which you can simply download and install on a Debian-based distribution. When I moved to Fedora, some of my apps didn't have RPM files, so I had to manually convert them to DEB versions to use them, which isn't ideal.</p>    <h2>

However, Linux Mint isn't the only distro worth checking out
</h2><h3>
Don't base your entire judgment on one version of Linux

<p>Before you hop onto Linux Mint, it's worth noting that it's not the only distro out there that you can use as a beginner. It's one of the best points of entry, for sure, but you can totally experiment with other ones if you'd like.</p>    <p>While using Linux Mint, take note of all the aspects you dislike. Perhaps Linux Mint feels a bit <em>too</em> similar to Windows, and you'd like to add a bit of variety to the UI? Does Linux Mint update too often? Does it update too slowly? Do you dislike Cinnamon as a desktop environment and want to try something else? Do you want more control over what's installed on your system and want to build it from scratch? Or perhaps you want a distro that specializes in a specific task, such as work, gaming, or even serving as a server?</p>    <p>If you use Linux Mint and are completely satisfied with it, that's great! Just because Linux Mint is ideal for beginners, doesn't mean you <em>have</em> to grow out of it and use a different distro later on. However, if you <em>do</em> find some things you don't like, don't be afraid to go distro hopping or change up the desktop environment to find the one that checks the boxes for you, something <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-transition-windows-linux/" target="_blank">I highly recommend Linux newcomers try once or twice</a>.</p>    <p><span>I moved away from Linux Mint to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/kde/" target="_blank">Fedora KDE Plasma</a> because I enjoy how often Fedora updates, how it adopts Wayland tech, and how KDE Plasma works.</span> You can see an example of KDE Plasma in the screenshots above. As it's a desktop environment, you can install it on Linux Mint. However, I recommend trying Fedora KDE Plasma instead, as it allows you to use it without breaking anything. Your use case will be unique to you, so be sure to reach out or do research on the elements you treasure the most to find your perfect distro.</p>    <h3>
Linux Mint is a great start for Windows escapees
</h3>
<p>Whether you find a new home on Linux Mint or you end up moving on, I think it's well worth checking out if you want to give your Windows 10 PC a second life. Plus, if you're using older hardware, it may thank you for using a lighter OS over Windows 10.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ansible executes automation workflows using playbooks, which are akin to blueprints outlining tasks and their execution procedures. While playbooks are pretty easy to create once you get the hang of them, running them is a bit tedious if you use Ansible extensively in your home lab.</p>    <p>For example, I’ve got separate playbooks for updating packages, adding users, monitoring services, managing files, and modifying network settings. Since most VM distros in my home lab have separate package managers, I’ve made multiple playbooks to arm freshly-configured apps with my favorite distros. That’s before you include the variable files, inventory config, host documents, and other artifacts required by Ansible to execute automation chains. Since Ansible mainly relies on terminal commands, I have to constantly switch directories when deploying tasks from my library of playbooks.</p>    <p>Semaphore solves this issue by offering a sleek interface for all my Ansible documents, including inventory files for hosts, key stores for credentials, and project repos. Many of these, like the config files containing the host IP addresses and the key store documents containing the user credentials, can be interlinked even when they are in entirely different project directories. That’s a huge benefit when your Ansible setup is as chaotic as mine, and you can even connect GitHub repos to Semaphore and pull your playbooks from there.</p>    <h3>
Semaphore can run (and schedule) your playbooks

</div>
</div>
<p>While the ability to organize Ansible files is indeed helpful, the ability to execute playbooks from a centralized web interface is the best aspect of Semaphore. The Task Templates section lets you create reusable (or rather re-runnable) templates out of pre-existing Ansible playbooks, inventory configs, credential vaults, and other artifacts.</p>    <p>For folks who want to fine-tune their automation flows even further, Semaphore also lets you add tags, branch details, survey variables, CLI arguments, and a couple of other parameters to the template. Plus, Semaphore lets you schedule the execution tasks for templates, and you can even run parallel tasks if you want to configure multiple virtual guests simultaneously.</p>    <h3>

</div>
<p>Troubleshooting is one of the most important aspects of automation, as it’s easy to make mistakes even when you’re an Ansible veteran. Fortunately, Semaphore has some tricks up its sleeve to help you diagnose faulty config files. Similar to the command-line interface you’d use with a barebones setup, Semaphore provides detailed logs if things go wrong when running a Playbook, and you can add the -v argument inside a template to get verbose details about the errors.</p>    <p>Likewise, the Activity tab lists all the operations during an automation flow, so you can narrow down the steps where the execution chain went south. It even has a built-in notification facility, so you can get alerts when Semaphore can’t run your playbook tasks. Telegram is available on the Semaphore UI by default, though you can modify the config.json file for the platform to add support for emails, Slack, and (my favorite) Gotify.</p>    <h2>
Setting up Semaphore

Plenty of ways to get it up and running

<p>Semaphore, like other developer-centric tools, can be deployed in a variety of ways. I’m a fan of containerized setups, especially since installing the binary package and configuring a database server separately seems like a lot of hassle. While there are dedicated Docker Compose files for Semaphore out there, I went with a good ol’ Proxmox-powered LXC instead.</p>    <p>Thanks to the amazing Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts repository, deploying Semaphore was as simple as running the <em>bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/semaphore.sh)"</em> command inside the Shell tab of my PVE node. After choosing the <strong>Default settings</strong> and waiting for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/proxmox-guide/" target="_blank">Proxmox</a> to work its magic, I headed into the Semaphore LXC’s Console menu and typed <em>cat ~/semaphore.creds</em> to grab the password. Switching to the Semaphore container’s web UI, I entered admin as the <strong>Username</strong> alongside the <strong>Password</strong> I copied earlier. With that, it was time to create and deploy some playbooks.</p>    <h3>
You’ll have to add multiple files to the server though
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-784772599" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-784772599" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-784772599" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-784772599" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-784772599-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of my favorite aspects of the Semaphore LXC is that it not only configures the database for the app, but it also installs Ansible, so I don’t need to set up the automation platform separately. Unfortunately, Ansible requires a couple of other documents besides playbooks, so I had to set those up first.</p>    <p>I started things off with the inventory file, which is responsible for pointing Ansible automations to the client IP addresses. Although I could’ve created a file on the Semaphore LXC and linked to it, I made a static file inside the <strong>Inventory</strong> tab and added the following code to it.</p>    <pre>[ayushs-server]<br>192.168.0.94</pre>    <p>Next, I had to create a project repo, which is essentially a folder containing my playbooks. So, I went back to the Semaphore LXC tab on my Proxmox node and used the <em>mkdir </em>command to create a path inside the home folder. Then, I added this location to the <strong>Repository</strong> tab on Semaphore’s web UI. I also had to add the user credentials for this virtual machine, or else I wouldn’t be able to execute automation scripts on it. I did that by opening the <strong>Key Store </strong>tab and adding a <strong>Username</strong> and<strong> Password</strong>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, it was time to create a playbook for my VM. I headed back to the Semaphore LXC inside Proxmox’s interface and used the <em>nano</em> editor to create a new file that ends with the <em>.yml </em>extension. To keep things simple, I created a test playbook that installs Krita on the VM by adding the following code to it (with the right indentation, of course).</p>    <pre>--<br>- hosts: all<br> become: true<br> tasks:<br> - name: Krita setup<br> apt:<br> name: krita<br> state: latest<br> update_cache: true</pre>    <p>With all artifacts set up, I navigated to <strong>Task Templates </strong>inside Semaphore’s web UI and chose <strong>Ansible Playbook</strong> as the task I wished to create. Then, I added the LXC directory of the playbook as the <strong>Path</strong> and chose the <strong>Inventory</strong> and <strong>Repository</strong> options I’d set up earlier. I left the <strong>Variable Group</strong> empty and added the credentials from earlier under the <strong>Vault</strong> option before pressing the<strong> Create</strong> button. As a test, I ran the newly-created template, and within a few minutes, my Semaphore-powered Ansible instance had successfully installed Krita on my Debian VM.</p>    <h3>

<p>I’ve spent the last weekend messing around with Semaphore’s options, and it’s a powerhouse if you’re into hardcore home lab/DevOps experiments. I’ve created a handful of Ansible documents spread across multiple directories, and the ability to choose them when creating a template is a game-changer for my disorganized setup. Besides Ansible, Semaphore also supports Terraform, and I’m already itching to get my hands dirty with some VM-provisioning automations – especially since I use Terraform and Ansible with my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-clustered-cheap-devices-into-a-proxmox-ha-lab/" target="_blank">Proxmox cluster</a> to train my sysadmin skills.</p>]]>

Setting up Semaphore
</h2><h3>
Plenty of ways to get it up and running
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Installing Semaphore on a Proxmox LXC" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/semaphore-2.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">

<p>Semaphore, like other developer-centric tools, can be deployed in a variety of ways. I’m a fan of containerized setups, especially since installing the binary package and configuring a database server separately seems like a lot of hassle. While there are dedicated Docker Compose files for Semaphore out there, I went with a good ol’ Proxmox-powered LXC instead.</p>    <p>Thanks to the amazing Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts repository, deploying Semaphore was as simple as running the <em>bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/semaphore.sh)"</em> command inside the Shell tab of my PVE node. After choosing the <strong>Default settings</strong> and waiting for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/proxmox-guide/" target="_blank">Proxmox</a> to work its magic, I headed into the Semaphore LXC’s Console menu and typed <em>cat ~/semaphore.creds</em> to grab the password. Switching to the Semaphore container’s web UI, I entered admin as the <strong>Username</strong> alongside the <strong>Password</strong> I copied earlier. With that, it was time to create and deploy some playbooks.</p>    <h3>
You’ll have to add multiple files to the server though
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-784772599" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-784772599" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-784772599" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-784772599" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-784772599-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of my favorite aspects of the Semaphore LXC is that it not only configures the database for the app, but it also installs Ansible, so I don’t need to set up the automation platform separately. Unfortunately, Ansible requires a couple of other documents besides playbooks, so I had to set those up first.</p>    <p>I started things off with the inventory file, which is responsible for pointing Ansible automations to the client IP addresses. Although I could’ve created a file on the Semaphore LXC and linked to it, I made a static file inside the <strong>Inventory</strong> tab and added the following code to it.</p>    <pre>[ayushs-server]<br>192.168.0.94</pre>    <p>Next, I had to create a project repo, which is essentially a folder containing my playbooks. So, I went back to the Semaphore LXC tab on my Proxmox node and used the <em>mkdir </em>command to create a path inside the home folder. Then, I added this location to the <strong>Repository</strong> tab on Semaphore’s web UI. I also had to add the user credentials for this virtual machine, or else I wouldn’t be able to execute automation scripts on it. I did that by opening the <strong>Key Store </strong>tab and adding a <strong>Username</strong> and<strong> Password</strong>.</p>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Editing a Template in Semaphore" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/semaphore-8.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, it was time to create a playbook for my VM. I headed back to the Semaphore LXC inside Proxmox’s interface and used the <em>nano</em> editor to create a new file that ends with the <em>.yml </em>extension. To keep things simple, I created a test playbook that installs Krita on the VM by adding the following code to it (with the right indentation, of course).</p>    <pre>--<br>- hosts: all<br> become: true<br> tasks:<br> - name: Krita setup<br> apt:<br> name: krita<br> state: latest<br> update_cache: true</pre>    <p>With all artifacts set up, I navigated to <strong>Task Templates </strong>inside Semaphore’s web UI and chose <strong>Ansible Playbook</strong> as the task I wished to create. Then, I added the LXC directory of the playbook as the <strong>Path</strong> and chose the <strong>Inventory</strong> and <strong>Repository</strong> options I’d set up earlier. I left the <strong>Variable Group</strong> empty and added the credentials from earlier under the <strong>Vault</strong> option before pressing the<strong> Create</strong> button. As a test, I ran the newly-created template, and within a few minutes, my Semaphore-powered Ansible instance had successfully installed Krita on my Debian VM.</p>    <h3>
Semaphore is quite a powerful tool for automation lovers
</h3>
<div>

<img alt="The Task Templates in Semaphore" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/semaphore-16.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>I’ve spent the last weekend messing around with Semaphore’s options, and it’s a powerhouse if you’re into hardcore home lab/DevOps experiments. I’ve created a handful of Ansible documents spread across multiple directories, and the ability to choose them when creating a template is a game-changer for my disorganized setup. Besides Ansible, Semaphore also supports Terraform, and I’m already itching to get my hands dirty with some VM-provisioning automations – especially since I use Terraform and Ansible with my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-clustered-cheap-devices-into-a-proxmox-ha-lab/" target="_blank">Proxmox cluster</a> to train my sysadmin skills.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>Some of you might not agree with me, but I believe we don't need more powerful products. The current crop of PC hardware is plenty powerful for whatever one wishes to do with their PC. Every successive generation of CPUs and GPUs should aim for bigger numbers, but that doesn't need to be the priority anymore. The PC hardware industry has far bigger kinks to iron out — unfinished products, an unhealthy focus on AI, runaway pricing, and paper launches. We don't want <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/most-gamers-dont-need-fastest-cpu-gpu/" target="_blank">record-breaking GPUs or faster CPUs</a>; for once, give us lasting products that most of us can realistically own. </p>    <h2>
Innovation that was promised years ago
</h2><h3>
What happened to DirectStorage?
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1501811112" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1501811112" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1501811112" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1501811112" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1501811112-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Many of us have forgotten the promises made by the industry in the form of revolutionary technologies like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/does-directstorage-matter-gaming-performance/" target="_blank">DirectStorage</a>. Poised to disrupt the traditional pipeline of asset decompression bottlenecked by the CPU, it sought to connect the storage directly to the GPU for radically improved loading times and performance. However, years after that promised reality, only a handful of games support DirectStorage, and fewer still implement it the right way. In many instances, gamers have seen better performance without DirectStorage in games that seemingly support the feature.</p>    <p>Even ray tracing, championed by Nvidia back in 2018, still carries a prohibitive performance penalty on all but the most powerful graphics cards. Anyone hoping to experience the stellar visuals associated with the latest ray-traced games needs to choose between subpar performance and overpriced hardware. We have more powerful graphics cards than ever, but <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-ray-tracing-isnt-worth-performance-hit/" target="_blank">ray tracing remains elusive for the majority of gamers</a>. When will we see a game-changing shift that will make ray tracing easier to run on mainstream hardware? </p>    <h2>
More rigorous QA
</h2><h3>
Is it too much to ask for functioning hardware?
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-2028575475" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-2028575475" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-2028575475" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-2028575475" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-2028575475-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The last few years have been detrimental to the reputation of most PC hardware giants when it comes to quality assurance. Intel's overvolted 13th and 14th Gen CPUs were just part of the equation; Nvidia and AMD didn't want to feel left out either. Many <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-you-should-care-about-the-rtx-50-series-rops-fiasco/" target="_blank">RTX 50 series GPUs shipped with missing ROPs</a>, the updated <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/why-doesnt-nvidia-stick-to-8-pin-pcie-cables/" target="_blank">12V-2x6 connector continued to exhibit reliability issues</a>, and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-breaks-silence-on-over-100-dead-ryzen-7-9800x3d-cpus/" target="_blank">AMD's Ryzen X3D CPUs were seemingly dying</a> inside the motherboard sockets. Even the otherwise excellent <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/intel-arc-b580-has-a-major-flaw/" target="_blank">Intel Battlemage GPUs shipped with an unexplained performance overhead</a> when paired with older and budget CPUs.</p>    <p>The standards of testing and RMA practices have dipped to a new low in the industry, and consumers are left holding the bag. In the race to be the first to market, manufacturers are slacking off in the reliability department. Users don't have too many options, and are forced to buy whatever's available. However, something needs to change soon if more companies don't want to risk lasting damage to their brand.</p>    <h2>
Real performance gains instead of AI dependency
</h2><h3>
Where are the gains?
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-1703258776" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-1703258776" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-1703258776" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-1703258776" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-1703258776-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The latest generation of graphics cards seems to have taken AI-powered performance a bit too seriously. Instead of offering hardware-driven performance gains to consumers, both Nvidia and AMD have put all their eggs in the AI basket, shamelessly marketing sky-high FPS numbers powered by <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-works-best-doesnt-make-sense/" target="_blank">frame generation</a>. Despite what the FPS counter says, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/nvidia-fake-frames-new-normal/" target="_blank">AI-generated frames</a> aren't equivalent to rendered frames — the perceived smoothness of the game suffers to a degree that most people can spot. </p>    <p>Nvidia even claimed that its RTX 5070 packed RTX 4090 levels of performance, which obviously proved false when third-party benchmarks compared the rasterized performance of the two GPUs. AMD's RX 9000 series didn't offer a huge performance jump over the RX 7000 series either. If this is a sign of things to come, consumers will be forced to rethink PC upgrades in terms of value and longevity. </p>    <h2>
Components that we can actually buy
</h2><h3>
At realistic MSRPs
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-4-82418315" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-4-82418315" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-4-82418315" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-4-82418315" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-4-82418315-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>What use are the best CPUs and GPUs when most people can't even buy them for months after launch? That's exactly what's been happening during every major launch for the last five years. Whether it's due to a crypto boom, the pandemic, scalpers, or strained supply chains, it's been a nightmare for consumers to even get an opportunity to buy overpriced PC parts. The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/like-rtx-5000-series-paper-launches-more-common/" target="_blank">string of paper launches</a> continues, and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/we-may-never-get-gpus-at-msrp-again/" target="_blank">MSRPs don't mean a thing anymore</a>. Street prices keep climbing in the face of insufficient supply, and only those with deep pockets can stomach jacked-up prices at storefronts or third-party platforms.</p>    <p>Manufacturers ought to work on improving stock levels or avoid marketing fictitious MSRPs. Instead, they continue to operate with the knowledge that their products will continue to sell no matter what. There are enough consumers who will pay anything to own the latest hardware. This keeps the vicious cycle alive, preventing lasting changes to the supply chain or marketing trends. I would love to see in-stock products at announced prices the next time Nvidia, AMD, or Intel launches a new CPU or GPU lineup. </p>    <h2>
Digestible prices for mainstream components
</h2><h3>
It's too late already
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-5-1892138872" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-5-1892138872" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-5-1892138872" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-5-1892138872" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-5-1892138872-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>

<p>The latest generation of graphics cards seems to have taken AI-powered performance a bit too seriously.

Despite what the FPS counter says, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/nvidia-fake-frames-new-normal/" target="_blank">AI-generated frames</a> aren't equivalent to rendered frames — the perceived smoothness of the game suffers to a degree that most people can spot. </p>    <p>Nvidia even claimed that its RTX 5070 packed RTX 4090 levels of performance, which obviously proved false when third-party benchmarks compared the rasterized performance of the two GPUs.

<p>What use are the best CPUs and GPUs when most people can't even buy them for months after launch? That's exactly what's been happening during every major launch for the last five years.

<p>We knew that Samsung had a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xreal-project-astra-ar-glasses/" target="_blank">new headset in the works</a>, and it's now finally ready to unveil its latest project to the public. The brand's first Android XR headset, Project Moohan, will finally make its official debut on October 21.</p>    <p>But before the event, it is giving those that register a chance to score a $100 credit that can be used on any device that's announced. Like previous reservation opportunities, those interested will need to enter their name and email in order to secure the credit. </p>    <p>Of course, you won't be obligated to purchase anything you see, so if you're not interested, you can just pass and ditch the $100 credit. As you can imagine though, this is going to be a pretty big deal since it's a new product category for the brand.</p>    <p>While it's had pretty good success with phones, tablets, and wearables — a successful mixed reality headset is something that hasn't been done yet. In 2024, Apple released its <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/apple-vision-pro-review/" target="_blank">Vision Pro</a> headset, and despite a huge effort, it's pretty much been forgotten about.</p>
<p>Samsung's had more time to really refine its offering, while also checking out the ever-changing landscape. So it will be interesting to see what it comes up with. The good news is that it could have a pretty solid software backing thanks to Android.</p>    <p>But the real determining factor is going to be the price. If it can manage to deliver an attractive headset with excellent technologies that's actually affordable, Samsung could have a huge winner on its hands.</p>    <p>However, this is going to be its first attempt, so we'll just have to wait and see what it comes up with. Again, if you're even slightly interested, we recommend popping in your reservation in order to score the $100 credit towards the device.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>It can be argued that one of the most important companies to ever be involved with the arts is Disney. The company has influenced generations of people with their animations and feature films, and had a big impact on the world of video games. Disney games have been part of the childhoods of kids around the world, and have been impactful on the industry in ways that changed it positively forever. Whether it was during the 16-bit era or the modern day on home consoles, the effect that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-marvel-comics-games-that-are-avengers-level-classics" target="_blank">Disney-related games</a> had can be seen and felt even today.</p>    <p>But what were some of the most important Disney games to come out? The company and its many characters have managed to appear across home console generations over the decades. But while some video games have included Disney characters in ways that were meaningful, they haven't always impacted the industry or stood out to players in a big way. And yet, certain games were able to remain a benchmark for positive influence on video games beyond their initial release, and are often looked back on fondly as classics. Here are three Disney video game releases that positively changed gaming forever.</p>    <h2>
Ducktales (NES)
</h2><h3>
A legendary NES release
</h3>

<p>For some people, the release of <em>Ducktales</em> on the Nintendo Entertainment System marked a very important point for licensed games. Released in 1989 <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/franchises-overdue-capcom-fighting-collection-treatment" target="_blank">by Capcom</a>, <em>Ducktales</em> is based on the popular animated television show of the same name, with players controlling Uncle Scrooge as he explores locations for treasures and clashes with different villains from the show. It was a simple platformer to play, with a lot of its depth coming from the many hidden collectibles and pathways to discover on each stage. The gameplay has Scrooge using his cane as a pogo stick to reach higher platforms and items high up on the screen, as well as knocking out enemies he encounters.</p>    <p>There are five stages within <em>Ducktales</em> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/3-legacy-accessories-nintendo-can-bring-back-like-the-virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank">on NES</a>, each with their own theme and unique visuals. But one aspect of the game that stands out to many people is its soundtrack, with the moon stage being one of the most famous tracks that is referenced by people often. The game is also known for having multiple endings, which change based on the amount of treasure they accumulate by the end. Multiple characters from the show can be seen in the game, including Magica De Spell and Flintheart Glomgold. A remake of <em>Ducktales</em> was released in 2013, titled <em>Ducktales: Remastered</em>, and features the gameplay and expanded levels, but also has an entirely upgraded presentation and soundtrack. The game also included full voice acting for the characters, including the late voice of Uncle Scrooge, Alan Young.</p>

<p> The success of <em>Ducktales</em> paved the way for other Disney games to release <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/nes-games-never-coming-switch-online" target="_blank">on the NES</a>, which were based on other hit Disney animated shows that were part of the Disney Afternoon block of television. Games like <em>Darkwing Duck</em>, <em>Talespin</em>, and two games based on <em>Chip &amp; Dale: Rescue Rangers</em> were some of the system's biggest licensed releases, and were the springboard for more Disney games to appear on other platforms after the NES.</p>

<p>When people think of collectible figures connected to video games, they often think of two different kinds of "toys-to-life" franchises: Nintendo's amiibo and <em>Disney Infinity</em>. While Nintendo would release amiibo figures connected to their games in 2014, <em>Disney Infinity</em> was actually before it to release in 2013, even though it wasn't the first video game to have figures connected to it. The original game to do so was Activision's <em>Skylanders</em> series, which was related to the <em>Spyro the Dragon</em> franchise. But <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/5-rarest-playstation-3-games-youll-never-own" target="_blank"><em>Disney Infinity</em></a> took the concept and perfected it in a way only a company like Disney could, with its rich history of characters and popular franchises.</p>    <p>The game pushed the concept of players buying figures and having them appear in the game, which was done with a pad for character figures to be placed upon. At the same time, some figures came paired with toys that would open up new locations and themed settings to explore within the game, which were often tied to Disney series like <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Monster Inc.</em>, and many others. Getting the figures and connecting them to the game was a massively popular aspect to playing <em>Disney Infinity</em>, even though the game could be played without ever buying more figures. But to get the full effect and experience everything that <em>Disney Infinity</em> had to offer, players had to purchase at least one bundle to open up aspects of Playset mode and Toy Box mode.</p>

<p> There were a total of three major releases for <em>Disney Infinity</em>, which expanded the game in different ways. More figures were sold at retail stores, with new story and sandbox content added to the experience. Franchises like Marvel Comics and <em>Star Wars</em> became a major part of the game, as they both had multiple films being released in theaters. But while <em>Disney Infinity</em> was a success for many people, the series came to an abrupt end when Avalanche Studios was closed down in 2016. The series was retired by Disney and production on figures came to an end. Many connect what was done while <em>Disney Infinity</em> was still around to the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/these-3-nintendo-switch-2-games-are-going-to-be-major-releases-for-the-2025-holidays" target="_blank">success of Nintendo's amiibo</a> figures, with many noting the quality of the figures and focus on popular series being a big component to their success in the same way <em>Disney Infinity</em> had done before.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-it-felt-like-witnessing-console-wars" target="_blank">console wars between Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis</a> were filled with many game releases that were directly competing with one another. More often than not, some licensed games had alternate versions between the two consoles, which would look and play differently. One game release like that was <em>Disney's Aladdin</em>, which had very different experiences between both home consoles. The version that many people praise and feel was the better of the two was the release for the Sega Genesis in 1993, which was developed by Virgin Games. The version on Super Nintendo was made by Capcom, who had a long history at that point making games based on Disney properties.</p>    <p>The Genesis version of <em>Disney's Aladdin</em> stood out to players for its high-quality animation and straight-forward gameplay, which had Aladdin himself wielding a sword against enemies. While the game's story was loosely based on the plot of the iconic animated film, it took some liberties with it in multiple stages. Players still got to see all the main aspects from the movie, including the genie and other characters that Aladdin meets, but it was presented through the lens of an action-platformer where Aladdin would battle enemies like the sultan's guards and snakes. However, everything in motion had the same attention to detail with its animation and visual style that a Disney animated feature would have, with many frames providing smoother-looking movement for every character.</p>

<p> Many people consider <em>Disney's Aladdin</em> to be one of the best 16-bit Disney games to release, which also gave room for other Disney games to be developed <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-play-these-3-genesis-games-to-relive-the-best-that-sega-offered-in-the-90s" target="_blank">for the Sega Genesis</a> and Super Nintendo. <em>Disney's Aladdin</em> was followed up by games based on <em>The Lion King</em>, <em>The Jungle Book</em>, and multiple games based on <em>Disney's Beauty and the Beast</em> for the Genesis. The Super Nintendo also saw games based on the same animated features, but were also somewhat different. The success of <em>Disney's Aladdin</em> on the Sega Genesis also contributed to Nintendo finding ways to compete with the game on the Super Nintendo, which directly led to the development and release of <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>.</p>

<h3>
Magical influence across generations
</h3>
<p>The influence that the Walt Disney company has across entertainment mediums cannot be understated. While the company was building a legacy in cinemas with their animated features, they also found parallel success in video games with the titles based on their franchises. Even today, many <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/most-influential-video-games-decade" target="_blank">people reference and fondly remember</a> Disney games that were part of their childhood, which also happen to be impactful on the gaming industry in positive ways for everyone. Although there have been many Disney-related games to come out over the years which may have been successful, not all of them have been able to influence people in a major way beyond their initial release. And yet, some games have that extra magical touch that has lasted throughout the decades and are still viewed as classics that people enjoy today, which will eventually be passed on to the generations that come after.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>It can be argued that one of the most important companies to ever be involved with the arts is Disney. The company has influenced generations of people with their animations and feature films, and had a big impact on the world of video games. Disney games have been part of the childhoods of kids around the world, and have been impactful on the industry in ways that changed it positively forever. Whether it was during the 16-bit era or the modern day on home consoles, the effect that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-marvel-comics-games-that-are-avengers-level-classics" target="_blank">Disney-related games</a> had can be seen and felt even today.</p>    <p>But what were some of the most important Disney games to come out? The company and its many characters have managed to appear across home console generations over the decades. But while some video games have included Disney characters in ways that were meaningful, they haven't always impacted the industry or stood out to players in a big way. And yet, certain games were able to remain a benchmark for positive influence on video games beyond their initial release, and are often looked back on fondly as classics. Here are three Disney video game releases that positively changed gaming forever.</p>    <h2>
Ducktales (NES)
</h2><h3>
A legendary NES release
</h3>

<p>For some people, the release of <em>Ducktales</em> on the Nintendo Entertainment System marked a very important point for licensed games. Released in 1989 <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/franchises-overdue-capcom-fighting-collection-treatment" target="_blank">by Capcom</a>, <em>Ducktales</em> is based on the popular animated television show of the same name, with players controlling Uncle Scrooge as he explores locations for treasures and clashes with different villains from the show. It was a simple platformer to play, with a lot of its depth coming from the many hidden collectibles and pathways to discover on each stage. The gameplay has Scrooge using his cane as a pogo stick to reach higher platforms and items high up on the screen, as well as knocking out enemies he encounters.</p>    <p>There are five stages within <em>Ducktales</em> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/3-legacy-accessories-nintendo-can-bring-back-like-the-virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank">on NES</a>, each with their own theme and unique visuals. But one aspect of the game that stands out to many people is its soundtrack, with the moon stage being one of the most famous tracks that is referenced by people often. The game is also known for having multiple endings, which change based on the amount of treasure they accumulate by the end. Multiple characters from the show can be seen in the game, including Magica De Spell and Flintheart Glomgold. A remake of <em>Ducktales</em> was released in 2013, titled <em>Ducktales: Remastered</em>, and features the gameplay and expanded levels, but also has an entirely upgraded presentation and soundtrack. The game also included full voice acting for the characters, including the late voice of Uncle Scrooge, Alan Young.</p>

<p> The success of <em>Ducktales</em> paved the way for other Disney games to release <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/nes-games-never-coming-switch-online" target="_blank">on the NES</a>, which were based on other hit Disney animated shows that were part of the Disney Afternoon block of television. Games like <em>Darkwing Duck</em>, <em>Talespin</em>, and two games based on <em>Chip &amp; Dale: Rescue Rangers</em> were some of the system's biggest licensed releases, and were the springboard for more Disney games to appear on other platforms after the NES.</p>

<p>When people think of collectible figures connected to video games, they often think of two different kinds of "toys-to-life" franchises: Nintendo's amiibo and <em>Disney Infinity</em>. While Nintendo would release amiibo figures connected to their games in 2014, <em>Disney Infinity</em> was actually before it to release in 2013, even though it wasn't the first video game to have figures connected to it. The original game to do so was Activision's <em>Skylanders</em> series, which was related to the <em>Spyro the Dragon</em> franchise. But <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/5-rarest-playstation-3-games-youll-never-own" target="_blank"><em>Disney Infinity</em></a> took the concept and perfected it in a way only a company like Disney could, with its rich history of characters and popular franchises.</p>    <p>The game pushed the concept of players buying figures and having them appear in the game, which was done with a pad for character figures to be placed upon. At the same time, some figures came paired with toys that would open up new locations and themed settings to explore within the game, which were often tied to Disney series like <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Monster Inc.</em>, and many others. Getting the figures and connecting them to the game was a massively popular aspect to playing <em>Disney Infinity</em>, even though the game could be played without ever buying more figures. But to get the full effect and experience everything that <em>Disney Infinity</em> had to offer, players had to purchase at least one bundle to open up aspects of Playset mode and Toy Box mode.</p>

<p> There were a total of three major releases for <em>Disney Infinity</em>, which expanded the game in different ways. More figures were sold at retail stores, with new story and sandbox content added to the experience. Franchises like Marvel Comics and <em>Star Wars</em> became a major part of the game, as they both had multiple films being released in theaters. But while <em>Disney Infinity</em> was a success for many people, the series came to an abrupt end when Avalanche Studios was closed down in 2016. The series was retired by Disney and production on figures came to an end. Many connect what was done while <em>Disney Infinity</em> was still around to the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/these-3-nintendo-switch-2-games-are-going-to-be-major-releases-for-the-2025-holidays" target="_blank">success of Nintendo's amiibo</a> figures, with many noting the quality of the figures and focus on popular series being a big component to their success in the same way <em>Disney Infinity</em> had done before.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-it-felt-like-witnessing-console-wars" target="_blank">console wars between Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis</a> were filled with many game releases that were directly competing with one another. More often than not, some licensed games had alternate versions between the two consoles, which would look and play differently. One game release like that was <em>Disney's Aladdin</em>, which had very different experiences between both home consoles. The version that many people praise and feel was the better of the two was the release for the Sega Genesis in 1993, which was developed by Virgin Games. The version on Super Nintendo was made by Capcom, who had a long history at that point making games based on Disney properties.</p>    <p>The Genesis version of <em>Disney's Aladdin</em> stood out to players for its high-quality animation and straight-forward gameplay, which had Aladdin himself wielding a sword against enemies. While the game's story was loosely based on the plot of the iconic animated film, it took some liberties with it in multiple stages. Players still got to see all the main aspects from the movie, including the genie and other characters that Aladdin meets, but it was presented through the lens of an action-platformer where Aladdin would battle enemies like the sultan's guards and snakes. However, everything in motion had the same attention to detail with its animation and visual style that a Disney animated feature would have, with many frames providing smoother-looking movement for every character.</p>

<p> Many people consider <em>Disney's Aladdin</em> to be one of the best 16-bit Disney games to release, which also gave room for other Disney games to be developed <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-play-these-3-genesis-games-to-relive-the-best-that-sega-offered-in-the-90s" target="_blank">for the Sega Genesis</a> and Super Nintendo. <em>Disney's Aladdin</em> was followed up by games based on <em>The Lion King</em>, <em>The Jungle Book</em>, and multiple games based on <em>Disney's Beauty and the Beast</em> for the Genesis. The Super Nintendo also saw games based on the same animated features, but were also somewhat different. The success of <em>Disney's Aladdin</em> on the Sega Genesis also contributed to Nintendo finding ways to compete with the game on the Super Nintendo, which directly led to the development and release of <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>.</p>

<h3>
Magical influence across generations
</h3>
<p>The influence that the Walt Disney company has across entertainment mediums cannot be understated. While the company was building a legacy in cinemas with their animated features, they also found parallel success in video games with the titles based on their franchises. Even today, many <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/most-influential-video-games-decade" target="_blank">people reference and fondly remember</a> Disney games that were part of their childhood, which also happen to be impactful on the gaming industry in positive ways for everyone. Although there have been many Disney-related games to come out over the years which may have been successful, not all of them have been able to influence people in a major way beyond their initial release. And yet, some games have that extra magical touch that has lasted throughout the decades and are still viewed as classics that people enjoy today, which will eventually be passed on to the generations that come after.</p>]]>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It can be argued that one of the most important companies to ever be involved with the arts is Disney. The company has influenced generations of people with their animations and feature films, and had a big impact on the world of video games. Disney games have been part of the childhoods of kids around the world, and have been impactful on the industry in ways that changed it positively forever. Whether it was during the 16-bit era or the modern day on home consoles, the effect that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-marvel-comics-games-that-are-avengers-level-classics" target="_blank">Disney-related games</a> had can be seen and felt even today.</p>    <p>But what were some of the most important Disney games to come out? The company and its many characters have managed to appear across home console generations over the decades. But while some video games have included Disney characters in ways that were meaningful, they haven't always impacted the industry or stood out to players in a big way. And yet, certain games were able to remain a benchmark for positive influence on video games beyond their initial release, and are often looked back on fondly as classics. Here are three Disney video game releases that positively changed gaming forever.</p>    <h2>
Ducktales (NES)
</h2><h3>
A legendary NES release
</h3>

<p>For some people, the release of <em>Ducktales</em> on the Nintendo Entertainment System marked a very important point for licensed games. Released in 1989 <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/franchises-overdue-capcom-fighting-collection-treatment" target="_blank">by Capcom</a>, <em>Ducktales</em> is based on the popular animated television show of the same name, with players controlling Uncle Scrooge as he explores locations for treasures and clashes with different villains from the show. It was a simple platformer to play, with a lot of its depth coming from the many hidden collectibles and pathways to discover on each stage. The gameplay has Scrooge using his cane as a pogo stick to reach higher platforms and items high up on the screen, as well as knocking out enemies he encounters.</p>    <p>There are five stages within <em>Ducktales</em> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/3-legacy-accessories-nintendo-can-bring-back-like-the-virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank">on NES</a>, each with their own theme and unique visuals. But one aspect of the game that stands out to many people is its soundtrack, with the moon stage being one of the most famous tracks that is referenced by people often. The game is also known for having multiple endings, which change based on the amount of treasure they accumulate by the end. Multiple characters from the show can be seen in the game, including Magica De Spell and Flintheart Glomgold. A remake of <em>Ducktales</em> was released in 2013, titled <em>Ducktales: Remastered</em>, and features the gameplay and expanded levels, but also has an entirely upgraded presentation and soundtrack. The game also included full voice acting for the characters, including the late voice of Uncle Scrooge, Alan Young.</p>

<p> The success of <em>Ducktales</em> paved the way for other Disney games to release <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/nes-games-never-coming-switch-online" target="_blank">on the NES</a>, which were based on other hit Disney animated shows that were part of the Disney Afternoon block of television. Games like <em>Darkwing Duck</em>, <em>Talespin</em>, and two games based on <em>Chip &amp; Dale: Rescue Rangers</em> were some of the system's biggest licensed releases, and were the springboard for more Disney games to appear on other platforms after the NES.</p>

<p>When people think of collectible figures connected to video games, they often think of two different kinds of "toys-to-life" franchises: Nintendo's amiibo and <em>Disney Infinity</em>. While Nintendo would release amiibo figures connected to their games in 2014, <em>Disney Infinity</em> was actually before it to release in 2013, even though it wasn't the first video game to have figures connected to it. The original game to do so was Activision's <em>Skylanders</em> series, which was related to the <em>Spyro the Dragon</em> franchise. But <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/5-rarest-playstation-3-games-youll-never-own" target="_blank"><em>Disney Infinity</em></a> took the concept and perfected it in a way only a company like Disney could, with its rich history of characters and popular franchises.</p>    <p>The game pushed the concept of players buying figures and having them appear in the game, which was done with a pad for character figures to be placed upon. At the same time, some figures came paired with toys that would open up new locations and themed settings to explore within the game, which were often tied to Disney series like <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Monster Inc.</em>, and many others. Getting the figures and connecting them to the game was a massively popular aspect to playing <em>Disney Infinity</em>, even though the game could be played without ever buying more figures. But to get the full effect and experience everything that <em>Disney Infinity</em> had to offer, players had to purchase at least one bundle to open up aspects of Playset mode and Toy Box mode.</p>

<p> There were a total of three major releases for <em>Disney Infinity</em>, which expanded the game in different ways. More figures were sold at retail stores, with new story and sandbox content added to the experience. Franchises like Marvel Comics and <em>Star Wars</em> became a major part of the game, as they both had multiple films being released in theaters. But while <em>Disney Infinity</em> was a success for many people, the series came to an abrupt end when Avalanche Studios was closed down in 2016. The series was retired by Disney and production on figures came to an end. Many connect what was done while <em>Disney Infinity</em> was still around to the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/these-3-nintendo-switch-2-games-are-going-to-be-major-releases-for-the-2025-holidays" target="_blank">success of Nintendo's amiibo</a> figures, with many noting the quality of the figures and focus on popular series being a big component to their success in the same way <em>Disney Infinity</em> had done before.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-it-felt-like-witnessing-console-wars" target="_blank">console wars between Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis</a> were filled with many game releases that were directly competing with one another. More often than not, some licensed games had alternate versions between the two consoles, which would look and play differently. One game release like that was <em>Disney's Aladdin</em>, which had very different experiences between both home consoles. The version that many people praise and feel was the better of the two was the release for the Sega Genesis in 1993, which was developed by Virgin Games. The version on Super Nintendo was made by Capcom, who had a long history at that point making games based on Disney properties.</p>    <p>The Genesis version of <em>Disney's Aladdin</em> stood out to players for its high-quality animation and straight-forward gameplay, which had Aladdin himself wielding a sword against enemies. While the game's story was loosely based on the plot of the iconic animated film, it took some liberties with it in multiple stages. Players still got to see all the main aspects from the movie, including the genie and other characters that Aladdin meets, but it was presented through the lens of an action-platformer where Aladdin would battle enemies like the sultan's guards and snakes. However, everything in motion had the same attention to detail with its animation and visual style that a Disney animated feature would have, with many frames providing smoother-looking movement for every character.</p>

<p> Many people consider <em>Disney's Aladdin</em> to be one of the best 16-bit Disney games to release, which also gave room for other Disney games to be developed <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-play-these-3-genesis-games-to-relive-the-best-that-sega-offered-in-the-90s" target="_blank">for the Sega Genesis</a> and Super Nintendo. <em>Disney's Aladdin</em> was followed up by games based on <em>The Lion King</em>, <em>The Jungle Book</em>, and multiple games based on <em>Disney's Beauty and the Beast</em> for the Genesis. The Super Nintendo also saw games based on the same animated features, but were also somewhat different. The success of <em>Disney's Aladdin</em> on the Sega Genesis also contributed to Nintendo finding ways to compete with the game on the Super Nintendo, which directly led to the development and release of <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>.</p>

<h3>
Magical influence across generations
</h3>
<p>The influence that the Walt Disney company has across entertainment mediums cannot be understated. While the company was building a legacy in cinemas with their animated features, they also found parallel success in video games with the titles based on their franchises. Even today, many <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/most-influential-video-games-decade" target="_blank">people reference and fondly remember</a> Disney games that were part of their childhood, which also happen to be impactful on the gaming industry in positive ways for everyone. Although there have been many Disney-related games to come out over the years which may have been successful, not all of them have been able to influence people in a major way beyond their initial release. And yet, some games have that extra magical touch that has lasted throughout the decades and are still viewed as classics that people enjoy today, which will eventually be passed on to the generations that come after.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/support-for-windows-10-has-ended-but-microsoft-defender-will-continue-to-protect-your-pc/" target="_blank">Neowin</a>, Microsoft has made a post on the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Blog. Titled "<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftdefenderatpblog/end-of-windows-10-support-what-defender-customers-need-to-know/4461349" target="_blank">End of Windows 10 Support: What Defender Customers Need to Know</a>," Microsoft clarifies what Windows 10 users can expect from Microsoft Defender as we move into the Extended Security Updates (ESU) period.</p>    <p>Here's what Microsoft says about Defender support for Windows 10:</p>    <blockquote>
<p>Defender supports a range of legacy systems, including Windows 10. (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/minimum-requirements#windows-versions-supported-by-defender-for-endpoint" target="_blank">See here for a full list of supported operating systems</a>.) Microsoft Defender will continue to provide detection and protection capabilities to the extent possible on Windows 10 and other legacy systems. Keep in mind that security solutions on legacy systems are inherently less secure and may not be able to receive all new features, so please review the next section for important actions you can take.</p>
<p>For Windows 10 customers without Defender, Microsoft will continue to provide security intelligence updates for the built-in Microsoft Defender Antivirus protection through October 2028. Of course, Defender Antivirus alone isn't a comprehensive risk mitigation posture without Microsoft Defender detection and response deployed across your digital estate.</p>
</blockquote><p>So, it sounds like Microsoft Defender will at least continue to work on Windows 10 for the next ESU year. The company hasn't clarified how long the support will continue, but from what I can guess, there's a good chance it'll continue to be used until the ESU expires. Given how Microsoft has previously stated that it <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-10-extended-security-update-program/" target="_blank">plans for three more years of support</a> for those enrolled, I'd wager that Microsoft Defender will be along for the ride for at least that long.</p>    <p>Of course, right after that passage, Microsoft recommends either continuing with Windows 10 under ESU or upgrading to Windows 11. Regardless of how much support Microsoft Defender receives in the coming years, enrolling in the ESU is still recommended to keep the operating system up to date.</p>]]>

    <itunes:title><![CDATA[I made my TrueNAS system virtually immortal]]></itunes:title>
    <itunes:author><![CDATA[XDA[RSS+]]]></itunes:author>
    <itunes:summary>
      <![CDATA[<p>While we've all taken different journeys into home lab experiments, one of the mainstays is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/use-truenas-proxmox-vm-prefer-bare-metal/" target="_blank">running your own NAS with an operating system like TrueNAS</a>. You get to use your own choice of hardware, which can be significantly more potent than bespoke NAS enclosures, and you get more ways of doing things. Plus, you get to choose your file system, and if you're not <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-zfs-is-the-best-filesystem-for-nas/" target="_blank">picking ZFS</a>, then I'm here to say you're wrong.</p>    <p>That's because between ZFS, virtualizing TrueNAS in Proxmox, and a handy backup tool, my TrueNAS is (nearly) immortal. It gives me two of the three pieces of a good     <span><a href="/duplicati-free-open-source-backup-tool/" target="_blank">3-2-1 backup strategy</a></span> and limits the effects of a power cut because of a beefy UPS battery. And while I could use <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/you-should-use-proxmox-backup-server-if-you-have-a-pve-home-lab/" target="_blank">Proxmox Backup Server</a> for most things, or the inbuilt TrueNAS backup tools, I've found that a tool called Sanoid makes things even easier.    </p>    <h2>
There's nothing worse than an apocryphal data event
</h2><h3>
But with ZFS you can recover thanks to snapshots
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-645048615" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-645048615" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-645048615" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-645048615" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-645048615-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the best features of TrueNAS is using the     <span><a href="/how-zfs-is-superior-to-btrfs/" target="_blank">ZFS file system</a></span>, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/zfs-mistakes-you-only-make-once/" target="_blank">which has numerous NAS-centric features to save you from your worst inclinations</a>. One of these is snapshots, which capture the full state of your NAS at that specific point in time. It's like how Time Machine works for macOS, or File History in Windows, except it's the entire contents of your NAS.    </p>    <p>To reduce the storage load this would take, ZFS does incremental snapshots, so each new saved version only captures the changes since the last snapshot, and the system can combine them if the worst happens, and you need to re-image your NAS. One setup many TrueNAS users employ is to have an all-flash storage pool for current projects that's snapshotted to a HDD-based pool with more storage, so that you can work on the speedy storage while keeping your data safely on longer-term drives. And that's (mostly) what my setup is, except the two storage pools are on different machines.</p>    <h3>
Sanoid makes the process easier
</h3>
<p>Sanoid was <a href="https://opensource.com/life/16/7/sanoid" target="_blank">designed to rebuild your storage when it all goes wrong</a>. It's all too easy to CLI away large swathes of data when using *nix-based operating systems, and TrueNAS is no exception. And with ZFS already built in, it has the tools to create the necessary backups, but it does take some persuasion to get it working. The other thing is that any backup solution that doesn't take into account <em>every</em> change is going to miss things when you restore, and Sanoid is a backstop against that.</p>    <p>By taking ZFS snapshots on a rigorous policy timeline, Sanoid covers your bases with a comprehensive spread of backup fodder for when it all falls down. In the words of Jim Salter (the wise developer behind it), it "help[s] you put Humpty Dumpty back together," at least if you're dealing with ZFS file systems. </p>

<p>TrueNAS has it's own tools for handling ZFS snapshots, but they're not the easiest to use, and there's one tool that beats all others for ZFS snapshot management. That's Sanoid, which has a ton of power for a very straightforward tool. It's more a suite of scripts to handle ZFS snapshots, both locally and over the network if you prefer, and I can see why it's a community favorite.</p>    <p>Sanoid is really simple to use; all you need is a cron job to have it run every minute so it doesn't miss any snapshot schedules:</p>    <pre>* * * * * TZ=UTC /usr/local/bin/sanoid --cron<br></pre>    <p>And then one file in <strong>/etc/sanoid/sanoid.conf</strong> that </p>    <pre>[data/home]<br> use_template = production<br>[data/images]<br> use_template = production<br> recursive = yes<br> process_children_only = yes<br>[data/images/win7]<br> hourly = 4<br><br>#############################<br># templates below this line #<br>#############################<br><br>[template_production]<br> frequently = 0<br> hourly = 36<br> daily = 30<br> monthly = 3<br> yearly = 0<br> autosnap = yes<br> autoprune = yes<br></pre>    <p>This sets the Sanoid script up to take <strong>36 hourly</strong>, <strong>30 daily</strong>, <strong>3 monthly,</strong> and <strong>no yearly</strong> snapshots for every dataset you have set under data/images. But I already said that I'm also sending those snapshots to my second NAS, and Sanoid has a tool for that too.</p>    <p>It's called Syncoid, and it's incredibly simple to use. If your local system had multiple storage pools, you could run Syncoid as follows, which would copy your stack of ZFS snapshots to the second storage pool:</p>    <pre>syncoid data/images/vm backup/images/vm<br></pre>    <p>I've got mine to send images to my Synology NAS, which has much more space than my     <span><a href="/all-ssd-storage-servers-the-good-the-bad-and-the-nasty/" target="_blank">all-flash NAS</a></span>. and Sanoid installed via Container Manager. The general syntax for that transfer is as follows:    </p>    <pre>syncoid data/images/vm root@synology_NAS:backup/images/vm<br></pre>    <p>And to get that replicated ZFS filesystem back from my other NAS:</p>    <pre>syncoid root@synology_NAS:data/images/vm backup/images/vm<br></pre>    <p>And that's it, a robust snapshot system on TrueNAS that's then sent to a Synology NAS for longer-term storage.</p>    <h3>
It's not quite that simple on TrueNAS
</h3>
<p>Two things make it harder to use Sanoid on TrueNAS. One is the limitation of adding things from the package manager, but using Sanoid Portable gets past that because you're making a custom app for TrueNAS with no needed dependencies. And the other is that TrueNAS has a habit of overwriting any custom scripts or tweaks when you do OS updates, which is irritating<span>. Still, <a href="https://github.com/furicle/Syncoid-Scale" target="_blank">this</a></span><a href="https://github.com/furicle/Syncoid-Scale" target="_blank"> script on GitHub will fix that</a> and make it easy to restore Sanoid to a working state once you've updated your NAS operating system.</p>    <h3>
There is one more piece of the puzzle
</h3>
<p>Since I'm passing relatively large amounts of data between my two NAS devices, I don't want to have a situation where power cuts out and data is lost on the wire, as it were. And that means I need a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ups-is-an-overlooked-pc-upgrade/" target="_blank">hefty UPS</a> to ensure that my NAS devices and network don't go down. The thing is, most UPS units have relatively small batteries, and that's a problem when I've got my whole home lab plugged in. Larger battery devices often don't switch over fast enough for sensitive electronics, which need less than 10ms switchover to continue operating.</p>    <p>But it's not a problem for the 3,072Wh cells inside the EcoFlow portable power station. I can plug my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/one-regret-from-going-all-in-on-power-over-ethernet/" target="_blank">PoE network stack</a>, NAS units, and other home lab equipment in, and if a power outage happens, it switches as fast as the smaller UPS on my PC. It'll even <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ups-nut-home-assistant-safely-shut-down-server-blackout/" target="_blank">send a standard NUT message out</a> to turn off all my computers and servers gracefully once data transfer is over, and probably still have tons of power left to stream my media server over the network so we have entertainment until the power comes back on.</p>

Between ZFS snapshots and a sturdy UPS, my TrueNAS is nearly immortal

<p>It takes a combination of technologies to keep my NAS going strong, but when they're set up correctly, it would take a truly apocalyptic event to make me lose data.

<p>TrueNAS has it's own tools for handling ZFS snapshots, but they're not the easiest to use, and there's one tool that beats all others for ZFS snapshot management. That's Sanoid, which has a ton of power for a very straightforward tool. It's more a suite of scripts to handle ZFS snapshots, both locally and over the network if you prefer, and I can see why it's a community favorite.</p>    <p>Sanoid is really simple to use; all you need is a cron job to have it run every minute so it doesn't miss any snapshot schedules:</p>    <pre>* * * * * TZ=UTC /usr/local/bin/sanoid --cron<br></pre>    <p>And then one file in <strong>/etc/sanoid/sanoid.conf</strong> that </p>    <pre>[data/home]<br> use_template = production<br>[data/images]<br> use_template = production<br> recursive = yes<br> process_children_only = yes<br>[data/images/win7]<br> hourly = 4<br><br>#############################<br># templates below this line #<br>#############################<br><br>[template_production]<br> frequently = 0<br> hourly = 36<br> daily = 30<br> monthly = 3<br> yearly = 0<br> autosnap = yes<br> autoprune = yes<br></pre>    <p>This sets the Sanoid script up to take <strong>36 hourly</strong>, <strong>30 daily</strong>, <strong>3 monthly,</strong> and <strong>no yearly</strong> snapshots for every dataset you have set under data/images. But I already said that I'm also sending those snapshots to my second NAS, and Sanoid has a tool for that too.</p>    <p>It's called Syncoid, and it's incredibly simple to use. If your local system had multiple storage pools, you could run Syncoid as follows, which would copy your stack of ZFS snapshots to the second storage pool:</p>    <pre>syncoid data/images/vm backup/images/vm<br></pre>    <p>I've got mine to send images to my Synology NAS, which has much more space than my     <span><a href="/all-ssd-storage-servers-the-good-the-bad-and-the-nasty/" target="_blank">all-flash NAS</a></span>. and Sanoid installed via Container Manager. The general syntax for that transfer is as follows:    </p>    <pre>syncoid data/images/vm root@synology_NAS:backup/images/vm<br></pre>    <p>And to get that replicated ZFS filesystem back from my other NAS:</p>    <pre>syncoid root@synology_NAS:data/images/vm backup/images/vm<br></pre>    <p>And that's it, a robust snapshot system on TrueNAS that's then sent to a Synology NAS for longer-term storage.</p>    <h3>
It's not quite that simple on TrueNAS
</h3>
<p>Two things make it harder to use Sanoid on TrueNAS. One is the limitation of adding things from the package manager, but using Sanoid Portable gets past that because you're making a custom app for TrueNAS with no needed dependencies. And the other is that TrueNAS has a habit of overwriting any custom scripts or tweaks when you do OS updates, which is irritating<span>. Still, <a href="https://github.com/furicle/Syncoid-Scale" target="_blank">this</a></span><a href="https://github.com/furicle/Syncoid-Scale" target="_blank"> script on GitHub will fix that</a> and make it easy to restore Sanoid to a working state once you've updated your NAS operating system.</p>    <h3>
There is one more piece of the puzzle
</h3>
<p>Since I'm passing relatively large amounts of data between my two NAS devices, I don't want to have a situation where power cuts out and data is lost on the wire, as it were. And that means I need a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ups-is-an-overlooked-pc-upgrade/" target="_blank">hefty UPS</a> to ensure that my NAS devices and network don't go down. The thing is, most UPS units have relatively small batteries, and that's a problem when I've got my whole home lab plugged in. Larger battery devices often don't switch over fast enough for sensitive electronics, which need less than 10ms switchover to continue operating.</p>    <p>But it's not a problem for the 3,072Wh cells inside the EcoFlow portable power station. I can plug my <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/one-regret-from-going-all-in-on-power-over-ethernet/" target="_blank">PoE network stack</a>, NAS units, and other home lab equipment in, and if a power outage happens, it switches as fast as the smaller UPS on my PC. It'll even <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ups-nut-home-assistant-safely-shut-down-server-blackout/" target="_blank">send a standard NUT message out</a> to turn off all my computers and servers gracefully once data transfer is over, and probably still have tons of power left to stream my media server over the network so we have entertainment until the power comes back on.</p>

<h3>
Between ZFS snapshots and a sturdy UPS, my TrueNAS is nearly immortal
</h3>
<p>It takes a combination of technologies to keep my NAS going strong, but when they're set up correctly, it would take a truly apocalyptic event to make me lose data. Between ZFS snapshots being taken on a regular schedule by Sanoid, which also handles all the trimming tasks to ensure those snapshots are as small as possible, and more battery capacity than I really need as a UPS, I know my data is as secure as it could be. The only missing part in this article is an off-site backup, which I haven't quite figured out yet.</p>]]></content:encoded>
