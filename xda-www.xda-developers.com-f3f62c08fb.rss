<p>Open Notebook is an open-source, AI-powered note-taking platform that lets you create notebooks for querying with the latest AI models. These notebooks could use URLs, PowerPoint, PDF, or other types of files, or you can feed it YouTube links to get AI transcripts for further analysis.</p>    <p>Open Notebook has many of the tools that initially drew me to NotebookLM, plus it's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/hated-llms-until-hosted-my-own/" target="_blank">not limited to only Google's models</a>:</p>        <ul>

<p>The only thing it can't use as a source is a direct connection to Google Docs, Notion, GitHub, or any of the other cloud services that some other NotebookLM replacements can link to.

<p>Open Notebook pulls all your sources into a local database and keeps them there.

<p>If you've got any Docker exposure, running Open Notebook won't take more than a few minutes. Copy the example on the GitHub page, save it as a docker-compose.yaml file like you'd do with any other container, and go on an API key hunt for the docker.env file containing all the container variables. </p>    <p>Open Notebook has a huge range of supported models, including:</p>        <ul>
<li>
<strong>OpenAI</strong>

<p>You can pick the AI models you want for all the different tools in Open Notebook, and I recommend you play around to see which works the best with your workloads. Google's Gemini models are best for larger context windows, and Elevenlabs are best for podcast creation, but other than that, you can pick the models you vibe best with. This gets you a tool suited to your needs and your budget, and not one that's limited in scope.</p>    <p>Once you have sources added to your notebooks, you can get into transformations, which are really the summaries and other insights that NotebookLM will create for you without being prompted. Or you can use the sidebar chatbot to ask deeper questions about context, and then save the answers as notes, deepening your understanding, and the amount of data the AI models have the next time you have questions.</p>    <h3>

<p>Podcast generation was my favorite tool in NotebookLM, and while it's not quite as polished in Open Notebook, it works. Again, customization is key here, and you can set the roles of the participants, their conversation style, engagement techniques, and dialogue structure to get a podcast you'll want to listen to, and not the one Google thinks you want to hear.</p>    <h3>

<p>I'll be the first to say my memory is terrible, but that's why AI tools like Open Notebook make so much sense to me. I can add my notes, things I've come across while browsing, and insights from experts, and combine them all into purpose-built notebooks for further query when I need to revisit a topic. It's the best way to support my working method, but it is a boon to anyone who has to research any topic deeply.</p>    <h3>

<p>The draw for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/finally-started-using-notebooklm-and-should-have-sooner/" target="_blank">NotebookLM is how easy it is to use</a>, and that's a simple fact. The setup for Open Notebook is tiresome, with a dozen or so different AI provider APIs to handle, then integrate and troubleshoot when they give you errors. I quickly ran into token limits for my free tiers of every service, so this is more a tool for those who want the best AI model for their needs, balanced against the cost of using the API over time.</p>    <h3>
Self-hosting my AI notebook keeps my essential data where I want it — on my own server

<p>Despite the amount of setup woes I encountered, I'm going to keep using Open Notebook. I like having my data saved on my own hardware, so that if Google, or anyone else, decides to stop developing the tool I've been using, I don't lose my curated data.

Open Notebook is quick to get running
</h2><h3>
But you'll need to go on an API hunt first
</h3>

</div>
</div>
<p>If you've got any Docker exposure, running Open Notebook won't take more than a few minutes. Copy the example on the GitHub page, save it as a docker-compose.yaml file like you'd do with any other container, and go on an API key hunt for the docker.env file containing all the container variables. </p>    <p>Open Notebook has a huge range of supported models, including:</p>        <ul>
<li>
<strong>OpenAI</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Anthropic</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Gemini</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Vertex.ai</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mistral</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Deepseek</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ollama</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Open Router</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Groq</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>xAI</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Elevenlabs</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Voyage AI</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Azure OpenAI</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Firecrawl</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Jina</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can pick the AI models you want for all the different tools in Open Notebook, and I recommend you play around to see which works the best with your workloads. Google's Gemini models are best for larger context windows, and Elevenlabs are best for podcast creation, but other than that, you can pick the models you vibe best with. This gets you a tool suited to your needs and your budget, and not one that's limited in scope.</p>    <p>Once you have sources added to your notebooks, you can get into transformations, which are really the summaries and other insights that NotebookLM will create for you without being prompted. Or you can use the sidebar chatbot to ask deeper questions about context, and then save the answers as notes, deepening your understanding, and the amount of data the AI models have the next time you have questions.</p>    <h3>
Podcast generation is my favorite tool
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="screenshot of open notebook's podcast generator settings" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/open-notebook-podcast-generation-settings.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Podcast generation was my favorite tool in NotebookLM, and while it's not quite as polished in Open Notebook, it works. Again, customization is key here, and you can set the roles of the participants, their conversation style, engagement techniques, and dialogue structure to get a podcast you'll want to listen to, and not the one Google thinks you want to hear.</p>    <h3>
Or I can query the documents I have saved for inspiration, recall, or insight
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="screenshot of open notebook's ask your knowledge base tool" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/open-notebook-query-knowledge-base.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>I'll be the first to say my memory is terrible, but that's why AI tools like Open Notebook make so much sense to me. I can add my notes, things I've come across while browsing, and insights from experts, and combine them all into purpose-built notebooks for further query when I need to revisit a topic. It's the best way to support my working method, but it is a boon to anyone who has to research any topic deeply.</p>    <h3>
</h3>
<h3>
Unfortunately, it's not a complete replacement for NotebookLM
</h3>
<p>The draw for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/finally-started-using-notebooklm-and-should-have-sooner/" target="_blank">NotebookLM is how easy it is to use</a>, and that's a simple fact. The setup for Open Notebook is tiresome, with a dozen or so different AI provider APIs to handle, then integrate and troubleshoot when they give you errors. I quickly ran into token limits for my free tiers of every service, so this is more a tool for those who want the best AI model for their needs, balanced against the cost of using the API over time.</p>    <h3>
Self-hosting my AI notebook keeps my essential data where I want it — on my own server
</h3>
<p>Despite the amount of setup woes I encountered, I'm going to keep using Open Notebook. I like having my data saved on my own hardware, so that if Google, or anyone else, decides to stop developing the tool I've been using, I don't lose my curated data. That's happened more times than I can remember with Google services, especially, and I don't want to make that mistake again.</p>    <p>blurb</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<div>    <ul>
<li>
Windows 10 hits EOL; final update only offers minor fixes; future updates are security-only.
</li>
<li>
Windows 11 receives a major update: AI-powered File Explorer actions, 'Click to Do' Summarize, and movable hardware indicators.
</li>
<li>
Update fixes many bugs (Hyper-V, SMBv1, gaming, Windows Hello) and adds a passkey manager and a Braille viewer.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</section><p>Well, here we are. This month's Patch Tuesday is also the end-of-life date for Windows 10. While people who are signed up for the Windows 10 extended support scheme will still receive security updates for at least another year, we'll see no more patches that address anything other than threats to the operating system.</p>    <p>Still, before Microsoft cuts the cord on Windows 10's feature updates, it has one more patch to release to the public. And, of course, because it's Patch Tuesday, Windows 11 gets an update too.</p>    <h2>
Windows 10 goes out with a whimper
</h2>

<p>For <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-14-2025-kb5066791-os-builds-19044-6456-and-19045-6456-657e5143-6c5d-4401-8efa-1641ca93c051" target="_blank">Windows 10</a>, its final update isn't much to get excited over. The final patch introduces some security fixes and adds the following patches from the preview build:</p>    <blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>[SMBv1 protocol connectivity (known issue)]</strong> Fixed: An issue where you might not be able to connect to shared files and folders if you're using the Server Message Block (SMB) v1 protocol on NetBIOS over TCP/IP NetBIOS (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-netbt" target="_blank">NetBT</a>). This can happen after installing update <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/topic/b343e907-4f50-41d9-80f8-519490551b91" target="_blank">KB5065429</a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP) (known issue)]</strong> Fixed: An issue when using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/autopilot/overview" target="_blank">Windows Autopilot</a> to deploy Windows 10, version 22H2 to devices with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/intune/intune-service/enrollment/windows-enrollment-status" target="_blank">Enrollment Status Page (ESP)</a> configured might find that the ESP doesn't load during the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE).
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote><p>From now on, Microsoft will only publish security-related updates for those who are enrolled for them.</p>    <h2>
Windows 11's Patch Tuesday is a lot more interesting
</h2>

</div>
</div>
<p>On the flipside, Windows 11 users are getting some nice tweaks this Patch Tuesday. First, it <span>incorporates all the changes made in the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/september-29-2025-kb5065789-os-builds-26200-6725-and-26100-6725-preview-fa03ce47-cec5-4d1c-87d0-cac4195b4b4e" target="_blank">September 29th preview build</a>, which is already quite substantial</span>. This includes a new Summarize action for Click to Do, movable hardware indicators, and tweaks to the File Explorer UI. Here are all the details:</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><section aria-labelledby="ID0EFL">A gradual rollout distributes a release update over a period of time instead of all at once. This means that users receive the update at different times, and it might not be immediately available to all users.</section>    </div>
<div>    <ul>
<li>
<strong>[Click to Do]</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> <strong>New and popular action tags</strong> in the <strong>Click to Do</strong> context menu help you discover the latest and most widely used AI-powered actions.
</li>
<li>
<em><strong>New! </strong> </em><strong>Click to Do</strong> provides more concise summaries with <strong>Summarize action</strong>. The output for text entities is shorter and more focused. Ongoing improvements continue to enhance clarity and precision.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Agents in Settings]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong></em> A direct navigation link to the corresponding settings page is available from agent search results. This improvement is currently rolling out to agents in <strong>Settings</strong> on Copilot+ PCs.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Desktop]</strong> <em><strong>New! </strong></em>You can now move the hardware indicators for brightness, volume, airplane mode, and virtual desktops to different positions on your screen. To change their position, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Notifications</strong>, and then pick from the options in the <strong>Position of the onscreen pop-up</strong> in the dropdown list.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Taskbar]<em> New!</em></strong> IT administrators no longer need to restart explorer.exe to apply the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/taskbar/pinned-apps?tabs=intune&amp;pivots=windows-11" target="_blank">pinning policy</a>. After applying the policy, users might see a pin on their taskbar within approximately 8 hours, depending on the refresh interval.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[File Explorer] </strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Use AI actions in File Explorer to edit images or summarize documents. Just right click (or press <strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>F10)</strong> on the file and select <strong>AI actions</strong>. This experience is not yet available for customers in the EEA (European Economic Area). <strong>Image actions:</strong> You can now use four AI-powered image actions with .jpg, .jpeg, and .png files. Visual Search searches the web using an image instead of text. <strong>Blur Background</strong> opens the <strong>Photos</strong> app to highlight the subject and blur the background.<strong> Erase Objects</strong> removes unwanted elements from your photo. <strong>Remove Background</strong> uses <strong>Paint</strong> to change any image leaving a smooth cut out of the subject. <strong>AI actions in Microsoft 365</strong> make it easier to work with your documents. With the <strong>Summarize action in Copilot</strong>, you can quickly generate summaries of files stored in OneDrive and SharePoint—no need to open each one. This AI action requires an active Microsoft 365 subscription and a Copilot license (Microsoft account and Microsoft Entra ID supported).
</li>
<li>
Improved: The File Explorer context menu has been updated to remove the accent colored backplate behind <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-behind-the-scenes" target="_blank">packaged app</a> icons in the <strong>Open With</strong> list when right clicking a file (for example, Snipping Tool). This change makes icons easier to see.
</li>
<li>
Improved: Made underlying changes to help improve the performance of launching cloud files from File Explorer and loading context menus.
</li>
<li>
Fixed: Icons and text might become overlapping on the desktop when using increased text scaling.
</li>
<li>
Fixed: Icons in the details, preview, and navigation panes of File Explorer aren’t properly mirrored when using an Arabic or Hebrew display language.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Windows Share]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong></em> You can pin your favorite apps in the <strong>Windows share window</strong> to quickly access them when you need them.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Advanced Settings]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong></em> The redesigned Advanced settings page (<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong>) is an update of the For Developers page and makes it easier to find key options. Settings include <strong>File Explorer</strong> + <strong>version control</strong>, which shows Git details such as branch, diff count, and last commit message directly in File Explorer when you select a repository folder.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Input]</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Insert dashes with new keyboard shortcuts. You can quickly insert an en dash (–) or em dash (—) while typing. Press <strong>Windows logo key</strong>+<strong>Minus (-)</strong> to insert an en dash, and <strong>Windows logo key</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Minus (-)</strong> to insert an em dash. If Magnifier is running, <strong>Windows logo key</strong>+<strong>hyphen (-)</strong> will zoom out Magnifier instead of inserting an en dash.
</li>
<li>
Fixed: After waking a PC from sleep, touch input might not work to enter your pin on the sign-in screen.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Narrator]</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Narrator now includes Braille Viewer, which shows both on-screen text and its Braille equivalent on a refreshable Braille display. To open Braille viewer and start Narrator, press the <strong>Windows logo key</strong>+<strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Enter</strong>, press <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/chapter-2-narrator-basics-5ff4591e-7b6d-245e-c95d-ce83c0a1a8d4" target="_blank">Narrator key</a>+<strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>B</strong>. A new floating window opens and updates dynamically as you navigate with Narrator. Before using Braille viewer, you must set up Narrator for Braille. To download and install the Braille support package, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Narrator</strong> &gt;<strong> Use a Braille display with Narrator</strong>.
</li>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Narrator offers a smoother, more natural experience in Word, with improved voice feedback, reliable continuous reading, and better navigation for footnotes, comments, lists, and tables. Enhancements include consistent list announcements, clearer table boundaries, and intuitive selection feedback.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Passkeys]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong> </em> A seamless <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop/security/third-party" target="_blank">plugin passkey manager integration</a> in Windows 11. You can now use plugin credential manager for passkeys. To set up a plugin credential manager, install a credential manager application that supports integration then go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Passkeys</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong>. Turn on support and complete user verification using Windows Hello (through face recognition, fingerprint, or PIN). Once verified, you can use your existing passkeys saved to the plugin credential manager or save new passkeys.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Settings] </strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> The <strong>Manage</strong> or <strong>clear your Bing search history</strong> entry under <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong> Privacy &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Search</strong> &gt; <strong>Search history</strong> has been removed. You can now manage your Bing search history directly from the <strong>Privacy dashboard</strong>, accessible via the <strong>Privacy resources</strong> link under <strong>Related settings</strong> on that Settings page.
</li>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> More time, language, and keyboard settings have moved from Control Panel to Settings. You can now add additional clocks, change your time server, and customize date and time formatting—including AM/PM symbols—directly from <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Time &amp; language</strong> &gt; <strong>Date &amp; time</strong>. Number and currency formats, Unicode UTF-8 support, and options to copy language and region settings to other accounts are now under<strong> Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Time &amp; language</strong> &gt; <strong>Language &amp; region</strong>. Keyboard character repeat and cursor blink rate settings are now easier to find under <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Improved: Made underlying changes to help improve the performance of loading the apps list in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Installed apps</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Fixed: <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Storage</strong> &gt; <strong>Disks and Volumes</strong> might show a link for BitLocker drive encryption in unsupported cases. Selecting it results in BitLocker opening and displaying <strong>error 0x80004005</strong>.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Gaming] </strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Xbox Wireless Controller support for gaming on Windows 11 handheld devices has improved.<strong> Short pressing</strong> the Xbox button opens <strong>Game Bar</strong>. A new change we're introducing is when you <strong>long press </strong>the Xbox button, it will open <strong>Task View</strong>.<strong> Pressing and holding </strong>the Xbox button continues to turn off the game controller. This update is currently available on supported handheld devices, and we plan to expand availability to more Windows 11 PCs soon.
</li>
<li>
Improved: Underlying changes have been made to improve performance when gaming with <strong>Game Bar</strong> or other overlays active on top of users' game. This update might especially help users with multiple monitors that have different refresh rates.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Other] <em>New! </em></strong>This feature offers a modern interface that aligns with Windows 11 visuals across several dialogs, including the one shown when an app fails to open.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Voice access]</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Natural language commanding in <strong>Voice access</strong> provides users with the flexibility to speak commands naturally, using filler words and synonyms, rather than rigid, predefined commands. This feature is now available for Intel and AMD-powered Copilot+ PCs.​​​​
</li>
<li>
Fixed: <strong>Voice access</strong> might get stuck in a state where it says it’s listening but is stuck and doesn’t respond.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[</strong><strong>Notification Center]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong></em> The Notification Center functionality is now available on secondary monitors. To open it, select the<strong> date and time</strong> in the system tray on the <strong>taskbar</strong>. With the August 2025 non-security update (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/august-29-2025-kb5064081-os-build-26100-5074-preview-3f9eb9e1-72ca-4b42-af97-39aace788d93" target="_blank">KB5064081</a>), you can also show a larger clock with seconds above the calendar.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Command line]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong></em> Windows now includes <strong>Edit</strong>, a text editor you can use from the command line.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<div>    <ul>
<li>
Windows 10 hits EOL; final update only offers minor fixes; future updates are security-only.
</li>
<li>
Windows 11 receives a major update: AI-powered File Explorer actions, 'Click to Do' Summarize, and movable hardware indicators.
</li>
<li>
Update fixes many bugs (Hyper-V, SMBv1, gaming, Windows Hello) and adds a passkey manager and a Braille viewer.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</section><p>Well, here we are. This month's Patch Tuesday is also the end-of-life date for Windows 10. While people who are signed up for the Windows 10 extended support scheme will still receive security updates for at least another year, we'll see no more patches that address anything other than threats to the operating system.</p>    <p>Still, before Microsoft cuts the cord on Windows 10's feature updates, it has one more patch to release to the public. And, of course, because it's Patch Tuesday, Windows 11 gets an update too.</p>    <h2>
Windows 10 goes out with a whimper
</h2>

<p>For <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-14-2025-kb5066791-os-builds-19044-6456-and-19045-6456-657e5143-6c5d-4401-8efa-1641ca93c051" target="_blank">Windows 10</a>, its final update isn't much to get excited over. The final patch introduces some security fixes and adds the following patches from the preview build:</p>    <blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>[SMBv1 protocol connectivity (known issue)]</strong> Fixed: An issue where you might not be able to connect to shared files and folders if you're using the Server Message Block (SMB) v1 protocol on NetBIOS over TCP/IP NetBIOS (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-netbt" target="_blank">NetBT</a>). This can happen after installing update <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/topic/b343e907-4f50-41d9-80f8-519490551b91" target="_blank">KB5065429</a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP) (known issue)]</strong> Fixed: An issue when using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/autopilot/overview" target="_blank">Windows Autopilot</a> to deploy Windows 10, version 22H2 to devices with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/intune/intune-service/enrollment/windows-enrollment-status" target="_blank">Enrollment Status Page (ESP)</a> configured might find that the ESP doesn't load during the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE).
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote><p>From now on, Microsoft will only publish security-related updates for those who are enrolled for them.</p>    <h2>
Windows 11's Patch Tuesday is a lot more interesting
</h2>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p>On the flipside, Windows 11 users are getting some nice tweaks this Patch Tuesday. First, it <span>incorporates all the changes made in the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/september-29-2025-kb5065789-os-builds-26200-6725-and-26100-6725-preview-fa03ce47-cec5-4d1c-87d0-cac4195b4b4e" target="_blank">September 29th preview build</a>, which is already quite substantial</span>. This includes a new Summarize action for Click to Do, movable hardware indicators, and tweaks to the File Explorer UI. Here are all the details:</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><section aria-labelledby="ID0EFL">A gradual rollout distributes a release update over a period of time instead of all at once. This means that users receive the update at different times, and it might not be immediately available to all users.</section>    </div>
<div>    <ul>
<li>
<strong>[Click to Do]</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> <strong>New and popular action tags</strong> in the <strong>Click to Do</strong> context menu help you discover the latest and most widely used AI-powered actions.
</li>
<li>
<em><strong>New! </strong> </em><strong>Click to Do</strong> provides more concise summaries with <strong>Summarize action</strong>. The output for text entities is shorter and more focused. Ongoing improvements continue to enhance clarity and precision.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Agents in Settings]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong></em> A direct navigation link to the corresponding settings page is available from agent search results. This improvement is currently rolling out to agents in <strong>Settings</strong> on Copilot+ PCs.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Desktop]</strong> <em><strong>New! </strong></em>You can now move the hardware indicators for brightness, volume, airplane mode, and virtual desktops to different positions on your screen. To change their position, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Notifications</strong>, and then pick from the options in the <strong>Position of the onscreen pop-up</strong> in the dropdown list.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Taskbar]<em> New!</em></strong> IT administrators no longer need to restart explorer.exe to apply the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/taskbar/pinned-apps?tabs=intune&amp;pivots=windows-11" target="_blank">pinning policy</a>. After applying the policy, users might see a pin on their taskbar within approximately 8 hours, depending on the refresh interval.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[File Explorer] </strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Use AI actions in File Explorer to edit images or summarize documents. Just right click (or press <strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>F10)</strong> on the file and select <strong>AI actions</strong>. This experience is not yet available for customers in the EEA (European Economic Area). <strong>Image actions:</strong> You can now use four AI-powered image actions with .jpg, .jpeg, and .png files. Visual Search searches the web using an image instead of text. <strong>Blur Background</strong> opens the <strong>Photos</strong> app to highlight the subject and blur the background.<strong> Erase Objects</strong> removes unwanted elements from your photo. <strong>Remove Background</strong> uses <strong>Paint</strong> to change any image leaving a smooth cut out of the subject. <strong>AI actions in Microsoft 365</strong> make it easier to work with your documents. With the <strong>Summarize action in Copilot</strong>, you can quickly generate summaries of files stored in OneDrive and SharePoint—no need to open each one. This AI action requires an active Microsoft 365 subscription and a Copilot license (Microsoft account and Microsoft Entra ID supported).
</li>
<li>
Improved: The File Explorer context menu has been updated to remove the accent colored backplate behind <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-behind-the-scenes" target="_blank">packaged app</a> icons in the <strong>Open With</strong> list when right clicking a file (for example, Snipping Tool). This change makes icons easier to see.
</li>
<li>
Improved: Made underlying changes to help improve the performance of launching cloud files from File Explorer and loading context menus.
</li>
<li>
Fixed: Icons and text might become overlapping on the desktop when using increased text scaling.
</li>
<li>
Fixed: Icons in the details, preview, and navigation panes of File Explorer aren’t properly mirrored when using an Arabic or Hebrew display language.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Windows Share]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong></em> You can pin your favorite apps in the <strong>Windows share window</strong> to quickly access them when you need them.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Advanced Settings]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong></em> The redesigned Advanced settings page (<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong>) is an update of the For Developers page and makes it easier to find key options. Settings include <strong>File Explorer</strong> + <strong>version control</strong>, which shows Git details such as branch, diff count, and last commit message directly in File Explorer when you select a repository folder.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Input]</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Insert dashes with new keyboard shortcuts. You can quickly insert an en dash (–) or em dash (—) while typing. Press <strong>Windows logo key</strong>+<strong>Minus (-)</strong> to insert an en dash, and <strong>Windows logo key</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Minus (-)</strong> to insert an em dash. If Magnifier is running, <strong>Windows logo key</strong>+<strong>hyphen (-)</strong> will zoom out Magnifier instead of inserting an en dash.
</li>
<li>
Fixed: After waking a PC from sleep, touch input might not work to enter your pin on the sign-in screen.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Narrator]</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Narrator now includes Braille Viewer, which shows both on-screen text and its Braille equivalent on a refreshable Braille display. To open Braille viewer and start Narrator, press the <strong>Windows logo key</strong>+<strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Enter</strong>, press <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/chapter-2-narrator-basics-5ff4591e-7b6d-245e-c95d-ce83c0a1a8d4" target="_blank">Narrator key</a>+<strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>B</strong>. A new floating window opens and updates dynamically as you navigate with Narrator. Before using Braille viewer, you must set up Narrator for Braille. To download and install the Braille support package, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Narrator</strong> &gt;<strong> Use a Braille display with Narrator</strong>.
</li>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Narrator offers a smoother, more natural experience in Word, with improved voice feedback, reliable continuous reading, and better navigation for footnotes, comments, lists, and tables. Enhancements include consistent list announcements, clearer table boundaries, and intuitive selection feedback.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Passkeys]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong> </em> A seamless <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop/security/third-party" target="_blank">plugin passkey manager integration</a> in Windows 11. You can now use plugin credential manager for passkeys. To set up a plugin credential manager, install a credential manager application that supports integration then go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Passkeys</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong>. Turn on support and complete user verification using Windows Hello (through face recognition, fingerprint, or PIN). Once verified, you can use your existing passkeys saved to the plugin credential manager or save new passkeys.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Settings] </strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> The <strong>Manage</strong> or <strong>clear your Bing search history</strong> entry under <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong> Privacy &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Search</strong> &gt; <strong>Search history</strong> has been removed. You can now manage your Bing search history directly from the <strong>Privacy dashboard</strong>, accessible via the <strong>Privacy resources</strong> link under <strong>Related settings</strong> on that Settings page.
</li>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> More time, language, and keyboard settings have moved from Control Panel to Settings. You can now add additional clocks, change your time server, and customize date and time formatting—including AM/PM symbols—directly from <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Time &amp; language</strong> &gt; <strong>Date &amp; time</strong>. Number and currency formats, Unicode UTF-8 support, and options to copy language and region settings to other accounts are now under<strong> Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Time &amp; language</strong> &gt; <strong>Language &amp; region</strong>. Keyboard character repeat and cursor blink rate settings are now easier to find under <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Improved: Made underlying changes to help improve the performance of loading the apps list in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Installed apps</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Fixed: <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Storage</strong> &gt; <strong>Disks and Volumes</strong> might show a link for BitLocker drive encryption in unsupported cases. Selecting it results in BitLocker opening and displaying <strong>error 0x80004005</strong>.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Gaming] </strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Xbox Wireless Controller support for gaming on Windows 11 handheld devices has improved.<strong> Short pressing</strong> the Xbox button opens <strong>Game Bar</strong>. A new change we're introducing is when you <strong>long press </strong>the Xbox button, it will open <strong>Task View</strong>.<strong> Pressing and holding </strong>the Xbox button continues to turn off the game controller. This update is currently available on supported handheld devices, and we plan to expand availability to more Windows 11 PCs soon.
</li>
<li>
Improved: Underlying changes have been made to improve performance when gaming with <strong>Game Bar</strong> or other overlays active on top of users' game. This update might especially help users with multiple monitors that have different refresh rates.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Other] <em>New! </em></strong>This feature offers a modern interface that aligns with Windows 11 visuals across several dialogs, including the one shown when an app fails to open.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Voice access]</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Natural language commanding in <strong>Voice access</strong> provides users with the flexibility to speak commands naturally, using filler words and synonyms, rather than rigid, predefined commands. This feature is now available for Intel and AMD-powered Copilot+ PCs.​​​​
</li>
<li>
Fixed: <strong>Voice access</strong> might get stuck in a state where it says it’s listening but is stuck and doesn’t respond.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[</strong><strong>Notification Center]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong></em> The Notification Center functionality is now available on secondary monitors. To open it, select the<strong> date and time</strong> in the system tray on the <strong>taskbar</strong>. With the August 2025 non-security update (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/august-29-2025-kb5064081-os-build-26100-5074-preview-3f9eb9e1-72ca-4b42-af97-39aace788d93" target="_blank">KB5064081</a>), you can also show a larger clock with seconds above the calendar.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<div>    <ul>
<li>
Windows 10 hits EOL; final update only offers minor fixes; future updates are security-only.
</li>
<li>
Windows 11 receives a major update: AI-powered File Explorer actions, 'Click to Do' Summarize, and movable hardware indicators.
</li>
<li>
Update fixes many bugs (Hyper-V, SMBv1, gaming, Windows Hello) and adds a passkey manager and a Braille viewer.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</section><p>Well, here we are. This month's Patch Tuesday is also the end-of-life date for Windows 10. While people who are signed up for the Windows 10 extended support scheme will still receive security updates for at least another year, we'll see no more patches that address anything other than threats to the operating system.</p>    <p>Still, before Microsoft cuts the cord on Windows 10's feature updates, it has one more patch to release to the public. And, of course, because it's Patch Tuesday, Windows 11 gets an update too.</p>    <h2>
Windows 10 goes out with a whimper
</h2>

<p>For <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-14-2025-kb5066791-os-builds-19044-6456-and-19045-6456-657e5143-6c5d-4401-8efa-1641ca93c051" target="_blank">Windows 10</a>, its final update isn't much to get excited over. The final patch introduces some security fixes and adds the following patches from the preview build:</p>    <blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>[SMBv1 protocol connectivity (known issue)]</strong> Fixed: An issue where you might not be able to connect to shared files and folders if you're using the Server Message Block (SMB) v1 protocol on NetBIOS over TCP/IP NetBIOS (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-netbt" target="_blank">NetBT</a>). This can happen after installing update <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/topic/b343e907-4f50-41d9-80f8-519490551b91" target="_blank">KB5065429</a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP) (known issue)]</strong> Fixed: An issue when using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/autopilot/overview" target="_blank">Windows Autopilot</a> to deploy Windows 10, version 22H2 to devices with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/intune/intune-service/enrollment/windows-enrollment-status" target="_blank">Enrollment Status Page (ESP)</a> configured might find that the ESP doesn't load during the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE).
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote><p>From now on, Microsoft will only publish security-related updates for those who are enrolled for them.</p>    <h2>
Windows 11's Patch Tuesday is a lot more interesting
</h2>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p>On the flipside, Windows 11 users are getting some nice tweaks this Patch Tuesday. First, it <span>incorporates all the changes made in the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/september-29-2025-kb5065789-os-builds-26200-6725-and-26100-6725-preview-fa03ce47-cec5-4d1c-87d0-cac4195b4b4e" target="_blank">September 29th preview build</a>, which is already quite substantial</span>. This includes a new Summarize action for Click to Do, movable hardware indicators, and tweaks to the File Explorer UI. Here are all the details:</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><section aria-labelledby="ID0EFL">A gradual rollout distributes a release update over a period of time instead of all at once. This means that users receive the update at different times, and it might not be immediately available to all users.</section>    </div>
<div>    <ul>
<li>
<strong>[Click to Do]</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> <strong>New and popular action tags</strong> in the <strong>Click to Do</strong> context menu help you discover the latest and most widely used AI-powered actions.
</li>
<li>
<em><strong>New! </strong> </em><strong>Click to Do</strong> provides more concise summaries with <strong>Summarize action</strong>. The output for text entities is shorter and more focused. Ongoing improvements continue to enhance clarity and precision.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Agents in Settings]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong></em> A direct navigation link to the corresponding settings page is available from agent search results. This improvement is currently rolling out to agents in <strong>Settings</strong> on Copilot+ PCs.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Desktop]</strong> <em><strong>New! </strong></em>You can now move the hardware indicators for brightness, volume, airplane mode, and virtual desktops to different positions on your screen. To change their position, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Notifications</strong>, and then pick from the options in the <strong>Position of the onscreen pop-up</strong> in the dropdown list.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Taskbar]<em> New!</em></strong> IT administrators no longer need to restart explorer.exe to apply the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/taskbar/pinned-apps?tabs=intune&amp;pivots=windows-11" target="_blank">pinning policy</a>. After applying the policy, users might see a pin on their taskbar within approximately 8 hours, depending on the refresh interval.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[File Explorer] </strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Use AI actions in File Explorer to edit images or summarize documents. Just right click (or press <strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>F10)</strong> on the file and select <strong>AI actions</strong>. This experience is not yet available for customers in the EEA (European Economic Area). <strong>Image actions:</strong> You can now use four AI-powered image actions with .jpg, .jpeg, and .png files. Visual Search searches the web using an image instead of text. <strong>Blur Background</strong> opens the <strong>Photos</strong> app to highlight the subject and blur the background.<strong> Erase Objects</strong> removes unwanted elements from your photo. <strong>Remove Background</strong> uses <strong>Paint</strong> to change any image leaving a smooth cut out of the subject. <strong>AI actions in Microsoft 365</strong> make it easier to work with your documents. With the <strong>Summarize action in Copilot</strong>, you can quickly generate summaries of files stored in OneDrive and SharePoint—no need to open each one. This AI action requires an active Microsoft 365 subscription and a Copilot license (Microsoft account and Microsoft Entra ID supported).
</li>
<li>
Improved: The File Explorer context menu has been updated to remove the accent colored backplate behind <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-behind-the-scenes" target="_blank">packaged app</a> icons in the <strong>Open With</strong> list when right clicking a file (for example, Snipping Tool). This change makes icons easier to see.
</li>
<li>
Improved: Made underlying changes to help improve the performance of launching cloud files from File Explorer and loading context menus.
</li>
<li>
Fixed: Icons and text might become overlapping on the desktop when using increased text scaling.
</li>
<li>
Fixed: Icons in the details, preview, and navigation panes of File Explorer aren’t properly mirrored when using an Arabic or Hebrew display language.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Windows Share]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong></em> You can pin your favorite apps in the <strong>Windows share window</strong> to quickly access them when you need them.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Advanced Settings]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong></em> The redesigned Advanced settings page (<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong>) is an update of the For Developers page and makes it easier to find key options. Settings include <strong>File Explorer</strong> + <strong>version control</strong>, which shows Git details such as branch, diff count, and last commit message directly in File Explorer when you select a repository folder.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Input]</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Insert dashes with new keyboard shortcuts. You can quickly insert an en dash (–) or em dash (—) while typing. Press <strong>Windows logo key</strong>+<strong>Minus (-)</strong> to insert an en dash, and <strong>Windows logo key</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Minus (-)</strong> to insert an em dash. If Magnifier is running, <strong>Windows logo key</strong>+<strong>hyphen (-)</strong> will zoom out Magnifier instead of inserting an en dash.
</li>
<li>
Fixed: After waking a PC from sleep, touch input might not work to enter your pin on the sign-in screen.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Narrator]</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Narrator now includes Braille Viewer, which shows both on-screen text and its Braille equivalent on a refreshable Braille display. To open Braille viewer and start Narrator, press the <strong>Windows logo key</strong>+<strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>Enter</strong>, press <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/chapter-2-narrator-basics-5ff4591e-7b6d-245e-c95d-ce83c0a1a8d4" target="_blank">Narrator key</a>+<strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>B</strong>. A new floating window opens and updates dynamically as you navigate with Narrator. Before using Braille viewer, you must set up Narrator for Braille. To download and install the Braille support package, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Narrator</strong> &gt;<strong> Use a Braille display with Narrator</strong>.
</li>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Narrator offers a smoother, more natural experience in Word, with improved voice feedback, reliable continuous reading, and better navigation for footnotes, comments, lists, and tables. Enhancements include consistent list announcements, clearer table boundaries, and intuitive selection feedback.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Passkeys]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong> </em> A seamless <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop/security/third-party" target="_blank">plugin passkey manager integration</a> in Windows 11. You can now use plugin credential manager for passkeys. To set up a plugin credential manager, install a credential manager application that supports integration then go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Passkeys</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong>. Turn on support and complete user verification using Windows Hello (through face recognition, fingerprint, or PIN). Once verified, you can use your existing passkeys saved to the plugin credential manager or save new passkeys.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Settings] </strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> The <strong>Manage</strong> or <strong>clear your Bing search history</strong> entry under <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong> Privacy &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Search</strong> &gt; <strong>Search history</strong> has been removed. You can now manage your Bing search history directly from the <strong>Privacy dashboard</strong>, accessible via the <strong>Privacy resources</strong> link under <strong>Related settings</strong> on that Settings page.
</li>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> More time, language, and keyboard settings have moved from Control Panel to Settings. You can now add additional clocks, change your time server, and customize date and time formatting—including AM/PM symbols—directly from <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Time &amp; language</strong> &gt; <strong>Date &amp; time</strong>. Number and currency formats, Unicode UTF-8 support, and options to copy language and region settings to other accounts are now under<strong> Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Time &amp; language</strong> &gt; <strong>Language &amp; region</strong>. Keyboard character repeat and cursor blink rate settings are now easier to find under <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Improved: Made underlying changes to help improve the performance of loading the apps list in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Installed apps</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Fixed: <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Storage</strong> &gt; <strong>Disks and Volumes</strong> might show a link for BitLocker drive encryption in unsupported cases. Selecting it results in BitLocker opening and displaying <strong>error 0x80004005</strong>.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Gaming] </strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Xbox Wireless Controller support for gaming on Windows 11 handheld devices has improved.<strong> Short pressing</strong> the Xbox button opens <strong>Game Bar</strong>. A new change we're introducing is when you <strong>long press </strong>the Xbox button, it will open <strong>Task View</strong>.<strong> Pressing and holding </strong>the Xbox button continues to turn off the game controller. This update is currently available on supported handheld devices, and we plan to expand availability to more Windows 11 PCs soon.
</li>
<li>
Improved: Underlying changes have been made to improve performance when gaming with <strong>Game Bar</strong> or other overlays active on top of users' game. This update might especially help users with multiple monitors that have different refresh rates.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Other] <em>New! </em></strong>This feature offers a modern interface that aligns with Windows 11 visuals across several dialogs, including the one shown when an app fails to open.
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Voice access]</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>New!</strong> </em> Natural language commanding in <strong>Voice access</strong> provides users with the flexibility to speak commands naturally, using filler words and synonyms, rather than rigid, predefined commands. This feature is now available for Intel and AMD-powered Copilot+ PCs.​​​​
</li>
<li>
Fixed: <strong>Voice access</strong> might get stuck in a state where it says it’s listening but is stuck and doesn’t respond.
</li>
<p> </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[</strong><strong>Notification Center]</strong> <em><strong>New!</strong></em> The Notification Center functionality is now available on secondary monitors. To open it, select the<strong> date and time</strong> in the system tray on the <strong>taskbar</strong>. With the August 2025 non-security update (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/august-29-2025-kb5064081-os-build-26100-5074-preview-3f9eb9e1-72ca-4b42-af97-39aace788d93" target="_blank">KB5064081</a>), you can also show a larger clock with seconds above the calendar.

<p>I used to think you had to pay for pro-level tools to get smooth editing and fast rendering. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-saying-goodbye-adobe/" target="_blank">Adobe software used to be my default</a>, and not necessarily because I loved it, but because every free alternative felt too limited or clunky (and I also felt loyal to Adobe). So for a long time, Premiere Pro felt like the only serious option to get high-quality video edits.</p>    <p>Then I tried Lightworks – a free, pro-grade NLE for videos. It’s perhaps most popular for being used by Thelma Schoonmaker for editing Martin Scorsese’s films. However, I’ve only been using the free version, and I’m also not a professional editor. Even then, it still holds up to Premiere Pro, except it’s lighter and doesn’t demand a subscription just to do the basics. Here’s why Lightworks is a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-video-editors-that-make-me-question-why-i-paid-for-adobe/" target="_blank">solid Adobe contender</a>…</p>    <h2>
Getting started was better than expected
</h2><h3>
The onboarding was surprisingly smooth and pleasant
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Lightworks onboarding screen" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/lightworks-onboarding-screen.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>I don’t tend to appreciate the million onboarding windows that many editors bombard you with. It gets in the way of my wanting to just use the tool already. Lightworks does have a brief onboarding process, but I actually appreciate how the app goes about it. First of all, you do need to make an account to use the software, but it doesn’t redirect you to your browser like most other apps – just enter your email and you’re in. Then it’ll ask you some questions like what type of creator you are and what keyboard layout you want (there are actually options for Adobe Premiere and DaVinci Resolve). Beyond that, all tutorials are optional – I opted out since I wanted to learn the software myself.</p>    <h2>
The Edit tab is all you need for Adobe-level editing
</h2><h3>
All the power without the clutter
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1752060408" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1752060408" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1752060408" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1752060408" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1752060408-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Lightworks takes a different approach from Premiere. Instead of scattering its features across panels, it sections everything you need into different workspaces. There’s an Edit tab, a VFX tab, and an Audio tab, the same way DaVinci Resolve divides itself into different workspaces. For video editing, you’ll want to get started in the Edit tab. It’s <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/use-this-video-editing-app-beginner-you-should-too/" target="_blank">easy enough for beginners to use</a>, but also comes with comprehensive features for pro-level edits.</p>    <p>In the top window is where you’ll import your footage and other media as sequences, and you drag them directly onto the timeline from there. You can do some basic clip manipulation directly in the timeline, such as snapping, trimming, and splitting. The Mark In and Mark Out options are a great way to define specific parts of a clip for editing, without having to cut them up. I also recommend checking out all the Transition options (in the top left pane) for getting some simple effects and animations onto your footage.</p>    <p>In the top right pane is where you’ll find the transform controls (called Framing) for things like changing the position of the clip, the size, tilt factor, and so on. However, I recommend switching to the VFX workspace to utilize these to their full potential, since that’s where the keyframe editor is. In this same panel is where you’ll find all the color correction and color grading options. The selection is very decent, with full color wheels and curves for creating cinematic looks.</p>    <h2>
You can do VFX and motion graphics
</h2><h3>
Premiere Pro doesn’t have a VFX-specific workspace
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="VFX window in Lightworks" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/vfx-window-in-lightworks.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>As I mentioned above, the VFX workspace is ideal for manipulating the Framing controls because it comes with a keyframe editor – keyframing is essential for creating high-quality and smooth motion graphics and animations. What I love about the VFX workspace is that it has a little panel for node-based editing called Routing, so you can set up your effects with visual blocks and connections, allowing for more precise control. This is also how <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/use-davinci-resolve-instead-after-effects-motion-graphics/" target="_blank">DaVinci Resolve’s Fusion tab works for motion graphics</a>, which lets me know Lightworks is really up there with the best of the best.</p>    <p>To get the most out of VFX, you’ll want to head to the left panel where you’ll find the Transform effects, which alters the frame and position of your footage. In this same panel, there are also more advanced coloring effects for more diverse looks on your footage. Moreover, you’ll find the chroma key in the same panel, which lets you do green-screening and masking. Plus, there are a bunch style and text options you can apply from here. Ultimately, you can create pretty much anything in this VFX workspace, and it is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-motion-graphics-editor-that-replaces-after-effects/" target="_blank">tailor-made for motion graphics</a>.</p>    <h2>
There’s audio editing, too
</h2><h3>
And it’s better than Premiere’s offerings
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Using the audio editor in Lightworks" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/using-the-audio-editor-in-lightworks.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Lightworks has an Audio workspace too, and it’s a fully-fleshed audio editor. It comes decked out with plugins like compressor, parametric EQ, reverb, noise reduction, crossfade, limiter, and way more. And on the bottom right, there’s an audio mixer for controlling the levels. I love it when video editing software takes audio seriously, since you can’t really separate visuals and sound.</p>    <h3>
Paying for Adobe Premiere isn’t necessary
</h3>
<p>I’ve only scratched the surface with Lightworks since I’m still in the process of integrating it into <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/built-video-editing-workflow-with-free-open-source-tools/" target="_blank">my video editing workflow</a>. But so far, I’m more than impressed. The export options and formats are also plentiful; however, free users won’t be able to render 4k, so that is one of the downsides. I’ll take a slightly lower export over being stuck in an Adobe subscription any day, though. I recommend giving Lightworks a go; it might replace Premiere Pro for you.</p>

<p>I used to think you had to pay for pro-level tools to get smooth editing and fast rendering. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-saying-goodbye-adobe/" target="_blank">Adobe software used to be my default</a>, and not necessarily because I loved it, but because every free alternative felt too limited or clunky (and I also felt loyal to Adobe). So for a long time, Premiere Pro felt like the only serious option to get high-quality video edits.</p>    <p>Then I tried Lightworks – a free, pro-grade NLE for videos. It’s perhaps most popular for being used by Thelma Schoonmaker for editing Martin Scorsese’s films. However, I’ve only been using the free version, and I’m also not a professional editor. Even then, it still holds up to Premiere Pro, except it’s lighter and doesn’t demand a subscription just to do the basics. Here’s why Lightworks is a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-video-editors-that-make-me-question-why-i-paid-for-adobe/" target="_blank">solid Adobe contender</a>…</p>    <h2>
Getting started was better than expected
</h2><h3>
The onboarding was surprisingly smooth and pleasant
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Lightworks onboarding screen" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/lightworks-onboarding-screen.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>I don’t tend to appreciate the million onboarding windows that many editors bombard you with. It gets in the way of my wanting to just use the tool already. Lightworks does have a brief onboarding process, but I actually appreciate how the app goes about it. First of all, you do need to make an account to use the software, but it doesn’t redirect you to your browser like most other apps – just enter your email and you’re in. Then it’ll ask you some questions like what type of creator you are and what keyboard layout you want (there are actually options for Adobe Premiere and DaVinci Resolve). Beyond that, all tutorials are optional – I opted out since I wanted to learn the software myself.</p>    <h2>
The Edit tab is all you need for Adobe-level editing
</h2><h3>
All the power without the clutter
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1752060408" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1752060408" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1752060408" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1752060408" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1752060408-img" data-gallery-type="">

<p>Lightworks takes a different approach from Premiere. Instead of scattering its features across panels, it sections everything you need into different workspaces. There’s an Edit tab, a VFX tab, and an Audio tab, the same way DaVinci Resolve divides itself into different workspaces. For video editing, you’ll want to get started in the Edit tab. It’s <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/use-this-video-editing-app-beginner-you-should-too/" target="_blank">easy enough for beginners to use</a>, but also comes with comprehensive features for pro-level edits.</p>    <p>In the top window is where you’ll import your footage and other media as sequences, and you drag them directly onto the timeline from there. You can do some basic clip manipulation directly in the timeline, such as snapping, trimming, and splitting. The Mark In and Mark Out options are a great way to define specific parts of a clip for editing, without having to cut them up. I also recommend checking out all the Transition options (in the top left pane) for getting some simple effects and animations onto your footage.</p>    <p>In the top right pane is where you’ll find the transform controls (called Framing) for things like changing the position of the clip, the size, tilt factor, and so on. However, I recommend switching to the VFX workspace to utilize these to their full potential, since that’s where the keyframe editor is. In this same panel is where you’ll find all the color correction and color grading options. The selection is very decent, with full color wheels and curves for creating cinematic looks.</p>    <h2>
You can do VFX and motion graphics
</h2><h3>
Premiere Pro doesn’t have a VFX-specific workspace
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="VFX window in Lightworks" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/vfx-window-in-lightworks.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>As I mentioned above, the VFX workspace is ideal for manipulating the Framing controls because it comes with a keyframe editor – keyframing is essential for creating high-quality and smooth motion graphics and animations. What I love about the VFX workspace is that it has a little panel for node-based editing called Routing, so you can set up your effects with visual blocks and connections, allowing for more precise control. This is also how <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/use-davinci-resolve-instead-after-effects-motion-graphics/" target="_blank">DaVinci Resolve’s Fusion tab works for motion graphics</a>, which lets me know Lightworks is really up there with the best of the best.</p>    <p>To get the most out of VFX, you’ll want to head to the left panel where you’ll find the Transform effects, which alters the frame and position of your footage. In this same panel, there are also more advanced coloring effects for more diverse looks on your footage. Moreover, you’ll find the chroma key in the same panel, which lets you do green-screening and masking. Plus, there are a bunch style and text options you can apply from here. Ultimately, you can create pretty much anything in this VFX workspace, and it is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-motion-graphics-editor-that-replaces-after-effects/" target="_blank">tailor-made for motion graphics</a>.</p>    <h2>
There’s audio editing, too
</h2><h3>
And it’s better than Premiere’s offerings
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Using the audio editor in Lightworks" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/using-the-audio-editor-in-lightworks.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Lightworks has an Audio workspace too, and it’s a fully-fleshed audio editor. It comes decked out with plugins like compressor, parametric EQ, reverb, noise reduction, crossfade, limiter, and way more. And on the bottom right, there’s an audio mixer for controlling the levels. I love it when video editing software takes audio seriously, since you can’t really separate visuals and sound.</p>    <h3>
Paying for Adobe Premiere isn’t necessary
</h3>
<p>I’ve only scratched the surface with Lightworks since I’m still in the process of integrating it into <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/built-video-editing-workflow-with-free-open-source-tools/" target="_blank">my video editing workflow</a>. But so far, I’m more than impressed. The export options and formats are also plentiful; however, free users won’t be able to render 4k, so that is one of the downsides. I’ll take a slightly lower export over being stuck in an Adobe subscription any day, though. I recommend giving Lightworks a go; it might replace Premiere Pro for you.</p>

<p> The big benefit of the new gaming handheld experience in Windows 11 is that this new "home" app (which is basically the Xbox app with some extras) brings together your games from all different kinds of platforms into one unified UI. It's something manufacturers had been doing for some time before this updated experience, except each company had to craft its own launcher until Microsoft decided to step up and offer a potentially universal solution.</p>    <p>And while that does make even more sense for a handheld due to the limited input methods, desktop users would surely appreciate it, too. The PC marketplace has become overcrowded as companies try to take on Steam, so gamers are likely to have titles from Steam, Epic Games, GOG, and other storefronts, so having to use different apps for them is very frustrating.</p>    <p>And sure, if you just add icons to your desktop and Start menu, then that may work just as well, but then you should also consider that computers are multi-purpose devices, and maybe you don't want all your gaming icons on the desktop when you're trying to get work done. Having a dedicated area just for your games could effectively let players choose between a work desktop and a gaming desktop at any point, which would create a more tailored experience for both cases. It's a win-win.</p>    <h2>

<p>I know many a PC gamer will scoff at the idea that controllers can be better than a mouse and keyboard, and sure, for many games, that setup is great. But honestly, beyond things that specifically require pointing, such as FPS or point-and-click games, controllers are also much easier to get to grips with (no pun intended). They offer a very targeted set of buttons and they're designed to have all those buttons reachable in a more natural way. Keyboards are more customizable, but they're just not tailored for this use case.</p>    <p>The point is, sometimes, even on PC, you may want to play games with a controller, and outside of this new experience, Windows 11 is still atrocious for it. Having this unified UI with all of your games that also supports controller inputs for easy access to games and settings, would be great even if you play on a desktop. It would make it possible to navigate the UI without having to switch back to your keyboard every time.</p>    <h2>
It's perfect for HTPCs, too
</h2><h3>
A great UI for TVs
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Falcon Northwest Talon desktop connected to a TV" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/09/falcon-northwest-tv-setup.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> It's also worth noting that not every PC has to be connected to a monitor at a desk. Everything is better on a big screen, and if you want to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/connecting-a-desktop-to-my-tv-was-the-best-choice/" target="_blank">use your PC for living room gaming</a>, the typical Windows 11 is less than optimal. For one thing, if you're in a living room setup, you're likely intending to use a controller anyway, since it's much easier to do that on a couch than having a mouse and keyboard. And as I've already mentioned, the standard Windows 11 UI is kind of atrocious if you want to use a controller.</p>    <p>Plus, even if you use a mouse and keyboard, Windows also isn't really designed for living rooms. Some UI elements may be too small and others may be too large, and using a typical desktop from a distance just isn't all that fun. There's a reason Steam uses the same UI for its Big Picture Mode and for gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. These are UI designs that use big UI elements that can easily be read from a distance and navigated with a controller.</p>    <p>Having this dedicated UI in Windows would give it a big benefit compared to other compelling options like installing Bazzite or Cachy OS to use as a home theater PC. You could even pair it with something like Emulation Station for when you want to dive into some retro titles while keeping the same kind of controller-friendly UI.</p>    <p>The simplified UI would even be great for general accessibility. Larger items and text, combined with easier navigation, would make it easier for more people to get started with PC gaming.</p>    <h2>
More gaming performance
</h2><h3>
Less background noise
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Ultrawide monitor showing Cyberpunk 2077 main menu with black bars on the sides" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/alienware-aw3423dwf-oled-ultrawide-monitor-cyberpunk-2077-main-menu.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> One important aspect —perhaps even the most important — of this gaming mode is that when you boot into this gaming-dedicated UI, Windows doesn't load the full desktop and all the services that come with it. It's a more streamlined experience that frees up more resources to improve gaming performance.</p>    <p>That may be especially beneficial for gaming handhelds and their mobile processors, but every gamer wants the best performance possible for their games. Even if you have an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and a top-of-the-line AMD processor, you wouldn't say no to more performance, and having the option to boot into this more streamlined gaming mode would certainly be welcome. Pair that with other performance tuning options for your hardware, and you can take your gaming performance to a whole new level.</p>    <h3>
Everyone can benefit
</h3>
<p>A dedicated gaming handheld UI for Windows 11 has been a long time coming, and it frankly should have happened sooner. But we shouldn't pretend like the UI for desktop PCs is perfect on Windows 11 to begin with. This same gaming UI could benefit desktop gamers, too, and that's not even touching on all the other UI improvements that could benefit Windows 11.</p>    <p>Whether Microsoft will make this new UI available on every PC regardless of form factor remains to be seen. At this point, the feature seems to be exclusive to the new gaming handhelds, so the first concern may be getting it to appear on older handhelds first. But really, there should be no reason to hold it back from any device type, so I hope Microsoft will see reason here.</p>]]>

<p>I know many a PC gamer will scoff at the idea that controllers can be better than a mouse and keyboard, and sure, for many games, that setup is great. But honestly, beyond things that specifically require pointing, such as FPS or point-and-click games, controllers are also much easier to get to grips with (no pun intended). They offer a very targeted set of buttons and they're designed to have all those buttons reachable in a more natural way. Keyboards are more customizable, but they're just not tailored for this use case.</p>    <p>The point is, sometimes, even on PC, you may want to play games with a controller, and outside of this new experience, Windows 11 is still atrocious for it. Having this unified UI with all of your games that also supports controller inputs for easy access to games and settings, would be great even if you play on a desktop. It would make it possible to navigate the UI without having to switch back to your keyboard every time.</p>    <h2>

</div>
<p> It's also worth noting that not every PC has to be connected to a monitor at a desk. Everything is better on a big screen, and if you want to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/connecting-a-desktop-to-my-tv-was-the-best-choice/" target="_blank">use your PC for living room gaming</a>, the typical Windows 11 is less than optimal. For one thing, if you're in a living room setup, you're likely intending to use a controller anyway, since it's much easier to do that on a couch than having a mouse and keyboard. And as I've already mentioned, the standard Windows 11 UI is kind of atrocious if you want to use a controller.</p>    <p>Plus, even if you use a mouse and keyboard, Windows also isn't really designed for living rooms. Some UI elements may be too small and others may be too large, and using a typical desktop from a distance just isn't all that fun. There's a reason Steam uses the same UI for its Big Picture Mode and for gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. These are UI designs that use big UI elements that can easily be read from a distance and navigated with a controller.</p>    <p>Having this dedicated UI in Windows would give it a big benefit compared to other compelling options like installing Bazzite or Cachy OS to use as a home theater PC. You could even pair it with something like Emulation Station for when you want to dive into some retro titles while keeping the same kind of controller-friendly UI.</p>    <p>The simplified UI would even be great for general accessibility. Larger items and text, combined with easier navigation, would make it easier for more people to get started with PC gaming.</p>    <h2>

<p> One important aspect —perhaps even the most important — of this gaming mode is that when you boot into this gaming-dedicated UI, Windows doesn't load the full desktop and all the services that come with it. It's a more streamlined experience that frees up more resources to improve gaming performance.</p>    <p>That may be especially beneficial for gaming handhelds and their mobile processors, but every gamer wants the best performance possible for their games. Even if you have an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and a top-of-the-line AMD processor, you wouldn't say no to more performance, and having the option to boot into this more streamlined gaming mode would certainly be welcome. Pair that with other performance tuning options for your hardware, and you can take your gaming performance to a whole new level.</p>    <h3>

<p>A dedicated gaming handheld UI for Windows 11 has been a long time coming, and it frankly should have happened sooner. But we shouldn't pretend like the UI for desktop PCs is perfect on Windows 11 to begin with. This same gaming UI could benefit desktop gamers, too, and that's not even touching on all the other UI improvements that could benefit Windows 11.</p>    <p>Whether Microsoft will make this new UI available on every PC regardless of form factor remains to be seen. At this point, the feature seems to be exclusive to the new gaming handhelds, so the first concern may be getting it to appear on older handhelds first. But really, there should be no reason to hold it back from any device type, so I hope Microsoft will see reason here.</p>]]>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft and Asus are set to launch the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/rog-xbox-ally-pre-order-and-pricing/" target="_blank">ROG Xbox Ally</a> gaming handhelds very soon, and with them comes a new <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-11/" target="_blank">Windows 11</a> experience designed for this kind of device. We've actually tried <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/enabled-new-windows-11-gaming-handheld-mode-rog-ally-x-amazing/" target="_blank">enabling this new software experience</a> on an existing gaming handheld and came away very impressed with Microsoft's strides to make the experience better and more comparable to something like the Steam Deck.</p>    <p>And while it's great that such an experience was crafted for handhelds (<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/5-things-windows-needs-be-better-gaming-handhelds/" target="_blank">as late as it may be</a>), I would argue that it's actually something that deserves to be on desktops, too. A dedicated gaming mode would be beneficial for all kinds of users, not just handhelds.</p>    <h2>
All your games in one place
</h2><h3>
And less clutter, too
</h3>

<img alt="xbox app on rog ally x showing game library including those installed from non-xbox launchers" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/09/xbox-full-screen-experience-on-rog-ally-x-4.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> The big benefit of the new gaming handheld experience in Windows 11 is that this new "home" app (which is basically the Xbox app with some extras) brings together your games from all different kinds of platforms into one unified UI. It's something manufacturers had been doing for some time before this updated experience, except each company had to craft its own launcher until Microsoft decided to step up and offer a potentially universal solution.</p>    <p>And while that does make even more sense for a handheld due to the limited input methods, desktop users would surely appreciate it, too. The PC marketplace has become overcrowded as companies try to take on Steam, so gamers are likely to have titles from Steam, Epic Games, GOG, and other storefronts, so having to use different apps for them is very frustrating.</p>    <p>And sure, if you just add icons to your desktop and Start menu, then that may work just as well, but then you should also consider that computers are multi-purpose devices, and maybe you don't want all your gaming icons on the desktop when you're trying to get work done. Having a dedicated area just for your games could effectively let players choose between a work desktop and a gaming desktop at any point, which would create a more tailored experience for both cases. It's a win-win.</p>    <h2>

      <![CDATA[<p>Things have not been going too well for Xbox and the recent changes to Xbox Game Pass. The price increase to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/3-games-to-play-on-xbox-game-pass-this-weekend-to-finish-august-right" target="_blank">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> has rubbed everyone the wrong way, and the changes to tiers of the service have been questionable to most people. Being a subscriber to Xbox Game Pass is getting tougher, even with many of the benefits that come with being part of it. But one aspect of Xbox Game Pass that has always been supplemental for most players was PC Game Pass, which also got some changes with the recent updates.</p>    <p>For what it was, PC Game Pass was a good service for people who owned a decent enough PC setup to play many of the games that were available in the library that Game Pass offered. But the majority of people who end up subscribing to the service do so to play games on their Xbox Series X/S console, even though the games to play on PC are a little different. While most Xbox players could dive into <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-review-more-of-the-same-but-a-bit-more-for-everyone-now" target="_blank"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a> and <em>Black Ops 7</em>, those on PC Game Pass had a number of PC-specific titles that were readily available. But what little value PC Game Pass had to the majority of people feel like it's been lost with the price increase to Xbox Game Pass, and there's hardly any reason to care about it.</p>

<p>While not every tier of Xbox Game Pass went up in price, two of the most relevant parts of the service did. Xbox Game Pass ultimate is now $29.99, which is up from its original $19.99 price point. But although the increase is frustrating for everyone, that tier of Game Pass did receive a number of changes that were added on to the benefits of being a subscriber. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-saved-money-on-these-3-big-games-by-playing-them-through-xbox-game-pass" target="_blank">More games would become available</a> as day 1 releases, and both Ubisoft and EA classics as part of the library. There are at least some major things that will be different with the changes that are incoming.</p>    <p>This cannot be said for PC Game Pass. The price of that part of the service will go up from $11.99 to $16.49 monthly, and will include Ubisoft+ classics for the library. But the majority of PC Game Pass is remaining the same, with little to nothing changing about it. People who subscribe to PC Game Pass will be paying more for what they were already getting before, especially if exploring classic Ubisoft titles from Ubisoft+ is not very relevant to someone. But what makes that extra add-on to the service questionable is how it won't include brand-new Ubisoft titles as day 1 releases, only the classics that have been out for a while. This almost defeats the purpose of even including Ubisoft+ classics in the service, since most players would be more interested in newer Ubisoft titles.</p>

Game Pass Ultimate subscribers had access to PC Game Pass as part of their benefits, but many people wouldn't take advantage of this unless they had a PC setup that could play those games reasonably. They were jumping onto the service for what it would give them for home consoles, not so much what it did for PC.</p>    <h2>
The supplemental Game Pass
</h2><h3>
Always been an afterthought

</div>
</div>
<p>This is one of the major issues with PC Game Pass and its relevance in comparison to the rest of the service. It always felt like an afterthought to what Game Pass is, not a central part of being tied to the service. As stated before, most people would <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/using-playstation-plus-and-xbox-game-pass-better-choice" target="_blank">subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> for the games they could have day 1 on their consoles, or access to newer games as they were added to the library for Xbox Series X/S.

<p> Does that mean PC Game Pass is completely irrelevant to them? Not entirely, because there are PC players that would own an Xbox Series X/S and have a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, which gave them PC Game Pass as well. So they would have the best of both worlds. But as people decide to walk away from Game Pass and cancel their subscriptions, it doesn't appear that PC players would really be missing out on a lot by having PC Game Pass active for them. The service just never gave everyone with a PC good enough reasons that they needed to have it, or risk missing out on what was going on there, whether it was new releases or beloved classics.</p>    <h3>

<p>What little noteworthy value that PC Game Pass had before everything changed feels like it's been lost now.

The price of that part of the service will go up from $11.99 to $16.49 monthly, and will include Ubisoft+ classics for the library. But the majority of PC Game Pass is remaining the same, with little to nothing changing about it. People who subscribe to PC Game Pass will be paying more for what they were already getting before, especially if exploring classic Ubisoft titles from Ubisoft+ is not very relevant to someone. But what makes that extra add-on to the service questionable is how it won't include brand-new Ubisoft titles as day 1 releases, only the classics that have been out for a while.

As stated before, most people would <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/using-playstation-plus-and-xbox-game-pass-better-choice" target="_blank">subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> for the games they could have day 1 on their consoles, or access to newer games as they were added to the library for Xbox Series X/S. Many of these games weren't always available on PC through PC Game Pass, and vice versa on a few titles as well. But Xbox Game Pass Ultimate was driven by those who owned a home console, and maybe had access to a PC to play games on. This was how it was commonly presented to players at various events, showcases, and whenever the company talked about what was new with Game Pass.</p>    <p>The sad truth is that PC players are not the dominant part of the Xbox audience, nor the central focus for what a service like Game Pass would be sustained by. Playing Xbox games that were also on PC was an extra perk, or something additional to the core experience of being in the Xbox ecosystem. It always feels like there isn't a full commitment to PC Game Pass being a substantial part of what Xbox Game Pass could be to players.</p>

<p> And with prices going up and people struggling to see the value of staying with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate moving forward, PC Game Pass will suffer collateral damage from it. Even the reveal of changes to Xbox Game Pass focused more on what was going to happen to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and what everyone would have on consoles, while the PC Game Pass information wasn't included in the big reveal and came out sometime after.</p>    <h2>
There are better options for PC players

Other ways that work out for them

<p> For those who already have a PC setup that they play games on, they already have many more <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/day-one-game-pass-great-consumers-gamble-indie-developers" target="_blank">options to get their gaming fix</a>. And it often doesn't need to involve a subscription service every month, especially one that gets a price increase. Gaming on platforms like Steam and the Epic Games Store has a myriad of deals that enable most new titles to sell pretty cheap. You can end up finding something in the many different Steam sales that will include tons of great titles, including brand-new releases, for the same new price that we find PC Game Pass at now. From that perspective, there's no real comparison, and it's not a hard choice to make.</p>    <p>But even before the changes to Xbox Game Pass as a whole, this was always true. The majority of PC gamers have a strong footing in their Steam library or a variety of other places to pick up <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/fantastic-games-you-can-play-xbox-game-pass" target="_blank">most of the games they're interested in</a>. And the best part is they don't have to spend much. PC Game Pass may have provided a single spot to have most games readily available on the platform with a subscription, but that may not matter to PC players who have been around for a while. For the price they would pay monthly, they already had other ways of paying less and getting more to their liking.</p>

<p> Does that mean PC Game Pass is completely irrelevant to them? Not entirely, because there are PC players that would own an Xbox Series X/S and have a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, which gave them PC Game Pass as well. So they would have the best of both worlds. But as people decide to walk away from Game Pass and cancel their subscriptions, it doesn't appear that PC players would really be missing out on a lot by having PC Game Pass active for them. The service just never gave everyone with a PC good enough reasons that they needed to have it, or risk missing out on what was going on there, whether it was new releases or beloved classics.</p>    <h3>
PC Game Pass is just there now
</h3>
<p>What little noteworthy value that PC Game Pass had before everything changed feels like it's been lost now. And it's a shame because that part of Xbox Game Pass never felt like it was given enough energy from Xbox to be a major aspect most players would care about. PC Game Pass was always just a part of the main focus of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/stock-up-on-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-for-just-20" target="_blank">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>, which was Xbox Series X/S. And while some may feel like it's still relevant in what Game Pass has to offer, it doesn't seem like Xbox players would really miss PC Game Pass if it just wasn't part of the service anymore. At this point, it might as well not be.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>When I first got into PC gaming, I used to take CPU boost clocks at face value and even prioritized them over base clocks. Seeing my old Ryzen 9 5900X advertised as "up to 4.8GHz" made me believe that's what I'd get while gaming or running demanding workloads. But as soon as I started <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/msi-afterburner-guide/" target="_blank">monitoring my PC using MSI Afterburner</a>, I noticed that the advertised boost clock wasn't something my CPU could sustain for very long.</p>    <p>If anything, the clock speed kept fluctuating every few seconds, spiking very close to the max boost clock for a brief moment before settling around 200MHz lower. At first, I thought my 360mm AIO cooler just wasn't good enough, but PC enthusiasts on Reddit were quick to point out my CPU's behavior was completely normal. That's when I learned that the advertised boost clocks are speeds that modern CPUs only reach under ideal conditions.</p>    <h2>
What "up to" really means

It's a clear sign that boost clocks are theoretical peaks, not sustainable speeds

<p>Honestly, I should've known better when I read the words "up to" on the CPU spec sheet. It's the kind of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-dont-trust-cpu-boost-clocks-anymore/" target="_blank">phrasing that quietly lowers expectations</a> without you realizing it. For instance, "Up to 6GHz" on the Intel i9-14900K's spec sheet doesn't mean it will actually run at 6GHz. Sure, it may hit that number under ideal conditions, but those are scenarios most users rarely ever replicate. What Intel and AMD are really implying with the "up to" claim is that the CPU can reach those speeds when workload, thermal, and power conditions all align perfectly.</p>    <p>The type of workload plays the biggest role in whether your CPU ever gets close to its advertised boost clock. Light, single-threaded workloads like web browsing and opening basic apps usually give the CPU the headroom it needs to boost to its advertised frequency. Unfortunately, modern games and productivity apps tax multiple cores, meaning your CPU doesn't have as much freedom to push its clock speeds as high. The more cores that are under load, the harder it becomes for any of them to reach, let alone maintain, that peak speed. That's why the all-core boost is almost always a few hundred MHz lower than the advertised single-core number.</p>    <h2>
Why your CPU never sustains boost clocks

More than just workloads, the CPU's thermal and power limits set the ceiling

<p>You probably already know how important cooling is to your CPU's performance, but many people don't realize just how directly it affects boost behavior. Modern CPUs constantly monitor their temperatures and make adjustments to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-hot-too-hot-cpu/" target="_blank">stay within the thermal limits</a>. For instance, if your Ryzen CPU is hovering around 85C, it's already close to its thermal ceiling, and as a result, it may start lowering its clock speeds to maintain stability. Unlike thermal throttling, this process isn't abrupt; the CPU just gradually dials back the frequency before it even reaches the point of throttling.</p>    <p>Likewise, power limits have just as much impact on how long your CPU can sustain its boost clocks. Modern CPUs have limits on how much power they can draw and for how long. When your CPU boosts, it temporarily exceeds its base power draw to reach higher frequencies, but the increased power draw comes with added heat and voltage demand. Once the CPU hits its predefined power limit, it will scale back voltage and clock speed to stay within its safe operating range.</p>    <h2>
Some CPUs can sustain their boost clocks
</h2><h3>
But that requires near-perfect conditions, which isn't realistic for most of us
</h3>

<p>I know some of you have probably seen game benchmarks where the CPU maintains the advertised boost clocks, so let me clarify that there are a few exceptions to the rule. Some CPUs can hold their boost clocks longer, but only when everything in the system is working in their favor. For starters, some <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/bios-power-limits-that-actually-matter-and-what-they-do/" target="_blank">high-end motherboards raise or remove the power limits</a> to give the CPU more headroom to boost higher, but that also means much higher power consumption and heat output. So, you'll need high-end cooling solutions with thick radiators or custom loops to keep those temperatures in check.</p>    <p>And let's not forget about the silicon lottery. No two CPUs are exactly identical, even if they share the same model number. Some chips are simply more efficient than others and require less voltage to hit the same frequencies. That efficiency translates to lower heat output, which can make it easier for those "golden samples" to hold their boost clocks a bit longer. But getting a golden sample isn't something you can control; it's just a matter of luck. Even with perfect conditions, most CPUs will still behave within the limits of their boost algorithm. They might hit peak speeds now and then, but no CPU can hold them for hours.</p>    <h3>
It's okay if your CPU doesn't hit its peak speeds
</h3>
<p>Modern CPUs already give you the best performance they safely can out of the box, so there's no need to chase higher boost clocks just to see a bigger number when you're monitoring your PC. Even if the boost clock sits a couple of hundred MHz lower than what's advertised, rest assured that it's performing exactly as it's supposed to. You're not missing out on any real performance gains just because your chip doesn't boost as high. But if you really want that extra bit of improvement, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/undervolting-my-cpu-was-one-of-the-best-system-upgrades-ive-ever-made/" target="_blank">you can always undervolt your CPU</a> to reduce heat and power draw, which often helps it sustain higher boost speeds for longer. The performance gains may be negligible, but the peace of mind you get from having a CPU that runs cooler, quieter, and more efficiently is worth far more in the long run.</p>]]>

That efficiency translates to lower heat output, which can make it easier for those "golden samples" to hold their boost clocks a bit longer. But getting a golden sample isn't something you can control; it's just a matter of luck. Even with perfect conditions, most CPUs will still behave within the limits of their boost algorithm. They might hit peak speeds now and then, but no CPU can hold them for hours.</p>    <h3>
It's okay if your CPU doesn't hit its peak speeds
</h3>
<p>Modern CPUs already give you the best performance they safely can out of the box, so there's no need to chase higher boost clocks just to see a bigger number when you're monitoring your PC. Even if the boost clock sits a couple of hundred MHz lower than what's advertised, rest assured that it's performing exactly as it's supposed to. You're not missing out on any real performance gains just because your chip doesn't boost as high. But if you really want that extra bit of improvement, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/undervolting-my-cpu-was-one-of-the-best-system-upgrades-ive-ever-made/" target="_blank">you can always undervolt your CPU</a> to reduce heat and power draw, which often helps it sustain higher boost speeds for longer. The performance gains may be negligible, but the peace of mind you get from having a CPU that runs cooler, quieter, and more efficiently is worth far more in the long run.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Why task managers fail at relationships
</h2><h3>
They're built for things, not people
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Todoist’s task input box with natural language typed in" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/temperature-checks-example.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Traditional task managers, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ditched-google-tasks-for-todoist/" target="_blank">like Google Tasks, for example</a>, are designed around projects and deadlines. They excel at "finish the report by Friday," but fall apart when you need to "check in with Sarah after her product launch" or "follow up with that potential client in two weeks." The problem isn't the tools themselves but how we use them.</p>    <p>Most people abandon these personal follow-ups because there's no immediate deadline pressure. A missed work deadline has consequences. A missed coffee chat with a former colleague? That just becomes another loose thread in your professional network.</p>    <p>Todoist's natural language input and recurring task features solve this by making relationship maintenance as systematic as any other workflow. You can type "Check in with Marcus every 3 months starting October 15," and the system handles the rest. No calendar <em>Tetris</em>, no mental overhead.</p>    <h2>
Getting personal with labels
</h2><h3>
They became my relationship taxonomy
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of the label list in Todoist, highlighting custom labels" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/todoist-labels-examples.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Here's where I diverged from conventional Todoist wisdom. Instead of labels like "@work" or "@errands," I created a relationship-focused labeling system that tracks the type of human interaction I'm managing. Some of the more creative ones are:</p>        <ul>
<li>
<strong>@nudges</strong>: Gentle follow-ups for warm leads or ongoing conversations. These are the "Hey, just circling back" messages that keep opportunities alive without being pushy.
</li>
<li>
<strong>@quiet-checkins</strong>: Low-pressure reconnections with people I want to stay in touch with but don't have an immediate reason to contact. Former colleagues, past clients, or friends in different cities.
</li>
<li>
<strong>@milestones</strong>: Birthdays, work anniversaries, product launches—moments where showing up matters. Todoist's recurring tasks make it impossible to forget these.
</li>
<li>
<strong>@temperature-checks</strong>: For active client relationships. These are scheduled check-ins to ask "How's everything going?" before problems become complaints.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The beauty of this system is that Todoist's filter views let me see all my relationship tasks at once, sorted by urgency and context. Every Monday, I review my @nudges filter to see who I should reach out to that week. This transformed follow-ups from a guilt-ridden afterthought into a predictable routine.</p>    <h2>
The natural language advantage
</h2><h3>
It removes friction from capturing ideas
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of a task added with specific priority, dates, and labels" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/todoist-output-for-natural-language.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Todoist's natural language processing is the secret weapon that powers this entire system. When I meet someone interesting at a conference, I can immediately create a task by typing: "Follow up with Jennifer about the design automation tool in 2 weeks @nudges." The system automatically:</p>        <ul>
<li>
Sets the due date
</li>
<li>
Applies my custom label
</li>
<li>
Adds it to my inbox for later organization
</li>
</ul>
<p>This speed matters because relationship opportunities have a short shelf life. The longer you wait to log a follow-up, the less likely it is to happen.</p>    <p>By reducing friction to near-zero, Todoist helps me capture every connection while the context is still fresh. I've watched colleagues scribble names on business cards or promise themselves they'll "remember to email later," and I've watched those connections evaporate.</p>    <h2>
How it tripled my follow-up rate
</h2><h3>
The numbers told the story
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of filters used to measure output and success" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/filters-for-success.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Before implementing this system, I tracked my follow-up behavior for a month (I know, very meta). Out of 20 potential follow-ups, I completed six. That's a 30% success rate, and honestly, even that felt optimistic. The ones I remembered were usually tied to immediate financial incentives or people who followed up with me first.</p>    <p>After six months of using Todoist as a relationship manager, my success rate jumped to 90%. Out of 30 logged follow-ups, I completed 27. The three I missed were intentional, such as situations where I decided the relationship wasn't worth pursuing. More importantly, the quality of my follow-ups improved. Because Todoist lets me add context notes to each task ("mention the Figma plugin she was excited about"), my messages felt personal and timely rather than generic.</p>    <p>This translated into tangible results: two long-term freelance contracts came from @quiet-checkins with past clients I'd worked with a year earlier. One coffee chat, scheduled via a @nudges task, led to a referral that became my biggest project last quarter. The compound effect of never forgetting anyone is that people start to see you as unusually thoughtful and organized, traits that inspire confidence in professional settings.</p>    <h2>
My oddball Todoist setups
</h2><h3>
Configurations that sound weird but work
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of configurations that I like on Todoist" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/unique-configurations-that-work-for-me.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Beyond labels, I've developed some unconventional Todoist habits that supercharge relationship management:</p>        <ul>
<li>
<strong>The "gratitude grenade" recurring task</strong>: Every Friday, I have a task to send one unsolicited thank-you message to someone who helped me that week. Could be a quick Slack message or an email. This habit, automated through Todoist's recurring task feature, has strengthened weak-tie relationships more than any networking event ever could.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Birthday task chains</strong>: For close friends and key clients, I don't just set a birthday reminder—I set a task three days before their birthday labeled @milestones with a subtask: "Order gift/card." This ensures I'm not panic-buying Amazon gift cards at 11 PM the night before.
</li>
<li>
<strong>The "hibernation" label</strong>: For relationships that are on ice but might warm up later, I use a @hibernation label with vague recurring tasks like "Check if Alex's startup raised funding every 6 months." These are low-effort, high-optionality bets that occasionally pay off when timing aligns.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Post-meeting debrief tasks</strong>: After every client meeting or pitch, I create a task: "Send follow-up email with [specific detail from conversation] within 24 hours." The specificity, captured via Todoist's comment feature, makes my follow-ups feel eerily attentive rather than templated.
</li>
</ul>

How the Todoist CRM angle pays off

</div>
</div>
<p> Todoist fundamentally changed how I think about professional relationships. While there are many alternatives, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/open-source-alternative-to-todoist/" target="_blank">even open-source ones</a>, on the market, Todoist continues to be my go-to for CRM.</p>    <p>When you systematize thoughtfulness, you create a competitive advantage that compounds over time. People remember the person who checked in during a tough week, who remembered their kid's graduation, or who followed up on that half-baked idea from three months ago.</p>    <p>This isn't manipulation; it's just being genuinely present in a world where everyone else is drowning in notifications. And for me, that shift from task list to relationship prosthetic made all the difference.</p>]]>

Why task managers fail at relationships
</h2><h3>
They're built for things, not people
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Todoist’s task input box with natural language typed in" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/temperature-checks-example.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Traditional task managers, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/ditched-google-tasks-for-todoist/" target="_blank">like Google Tasks, for example</a>, are designed around projects and deadlines. They excel at "finish the report by Friday," but fall apart when you need to "check in with Sarah after her product launch" or "follow up with that potential client in two weeks." The problem isn't the tools themselves but how we use them.</p>    <p>Most people abandon these personal follow-ups because there's no immediate deadline pressure. A missed work deadline has consequences. A missed coffee chat with a former colleague? That just becomes another loose thread in your professional network.</p>    <p>Todoist's natural language input and recurring task features solve this by making relationship maintenance as systematic as any other workflow. You can type "Check in with Marcus every 3 months starting October 15," and the system handles the rest. No calendar <em>Tetris</em>, no mental overhead.</p>    <h2>
Getting personal with labels
</h2><h3>
They became my relationship taxonomy
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of the label list in Todoist, highlighting custom labels" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/todoist-labels-examples.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Here's where I diverged from conventional Todoist wisdom. Instead of labels like "@work" or "@errands," I created a relationship-focused labeling system that tracks the type of human interaction I'm managing. Some of the more creative ones are:</p>        <ul>
<li>
<strong>@nudges</strong>: Gentle follow-ups for warm leads or ongoing conversations. These are the "Hey, just circling back" messages that keep opportunities alive without being pushy.
</li>
<li>
<strong>@quiet-checkins</strong>: Low-pressure reconnections with people I want to stay in touch with but don't have an immediate reason to contact. Former colleagues, past clients, or friends in different cities.
</li>
<li>
<strong>@milestones</strong>: Birthdays, work anniversaries, product launches—moments where showing up matters. Todoist's recurring tasks make it impossible to forget these.
</li>
<li>
<strong>@temperature-checks</strong>: For active client relationships. These are scheduled check-ins to ask "How's everything going?" before problems become complaints.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The beauty of this system is that Todoist's filter views let me see all my relationship tasks at once, sorted by urgency and context. Every Monday, I review my @nudges filter to see who I should reach out to that week. This transformed follow-ups from a guilt-ridden afterthought into a predictable routine.</p>    <h2>
The natural language advantage
</h2><h3>
It removes friction from capturing ideas
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of a task added with specific priority, dates, and labels" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/todoist-output-for-natural-language.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Todoist's natural language processing is the secret weapon that powers this entire system. When I meet someone interesting at a conference, I can immediately create a task by typing: "Follow up with Jennifer about the design automation tool in 2 weeks @nudges." The system automatically:</p>        <ul>
<li>
Sets the due date
</li>
<li>
Applies my custom label
</li>
<li>
Adds it to my inbox for later organization
</li>
</ul>
<p>This speed matters because relationship opportunities have a short shelf life. The longer you wait to log a follow-up, the less likely it is to happen.</p>    <p>By reducing friction to near-zero, Todoist helps me capture every connection while the context is still fresh. I've watched colleagues scribble names on business cards or promise themselves they'll "remember to email later," and I've watched those connections evaporate.</p>    <h2>
How it tripled my follow-up rate
</h2><h3>
The numbers told the story
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of filters used to measure output and success" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/filters-for-success.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Before implementing this system, I tracked my follow-up behavior for a month (I know, very meta). Out of 20 potential follow-ups, I completed six. That's a 30% success rate, and honestly, even that felt optimistic. The ones I remembered were usually tied to immediate financial incentives or people who followed up with me first.</p>    <p>After six months of using Todoist as a relationship manager, my success rate jumped to 90%. Out of 30 logged follow-ups, I completed 27. The three I missed were intentional, such as situations where I decided the relationship wasn't worth pursuing. More importantly, the quality of my follow-ups improved. Because Todoist lets me add context notes to each task ("mention the Figma plugin she was excited about"), my messages felt personal and timely rather than generic.</p>    <p>This translated into tangible results: two long-term freelance contracts came from @quiet-checkins with past clients I'd worked with a year earlier. One coffee chat, scheduled via a @nudges task, led to a referral that became my biggest project last quarter. The compound effect of never forgetting anyone is that people start to see you as unusually thoughtful and organized, traits that inspire confidence in professional settings.</p>    <h2>
My oddball Todoist setups
</h2><h3>
Configurations that sound weird but work
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of configurations that I like on Todoist" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/unique-configurations-that-work-for-me.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Beyond labels, I've developed some unconventional Todoist habits that supercharge relationship management:</p>        <ul>
<li>
<strong>The "gratitude grenade" recurring task</strong>: Every Friday, I have a task to send one unsolicited thank-you message to someone who helped me that week. Could be a quick Slack message or an email. This habit, automated through Todoist's recurring task feature, has strengthened weak-tie relationships more than any networking event ever could.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Birthday task chains</strong>: For close friends and key clients, I don't just set a birthday reminder—I set a task three days before their birthday labeled @milestones with a subtask: "Order gift/card." This ensures I'm not panic-buying Amazon gift cards at 11 PM the night before.
</li>
<li>
<strong>The "hibernation" label</strong>: For relationships that are on ice but might warm up later, I use a @hibernation label with vague recurring tasks like "Check if Alex's startup raised funding every 6 months." These are low-effort, high-optionality bets that occasionally pay off when timing aligns.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Post-meeting debrief tasks</strong>: After every client meeting or pitch, I create a task: "Send follow-up email with [specific detail from conversation] within 24 hours." The specificity, captured via Todoist's comment feature, makes my follow-ups feel eerily attentive rather than templated.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
The compounding returns of remembering
</h2><h3>
How the Todoist CRM angle pays off
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of overall Todoist tasks for the month and the dashboard in entirety" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/systemized-thoughtfulness.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p> Todoist fundamentally changed how I think about professional relationships. While there are many alternatives, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/open-source-alternative-to-todoist/" target="_blank">even open-source ones</a>, on the market, Todoist continues to be my go-to for CRM.</p>    <p>When you systematize thoughtfulness, you create a competitive advantage that compounds over time. People remember the person who checked in during a tough week, who remembered their kid's graduation, or who followed up on that half-baked idea from three months ago.</p>    <p>This isn't manipulation; it's just being genuinely present in a world where everyone else is drowning in notifications. And for me, that shift from task list to relationship prosthetic made all the difference.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Windows 10 is officially no longer supported after today, and it's time to upgrade to <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/windows-11/" target="_blank">Windows 11</a>. As long as you have a supported PC, it's very easy to install. But therein lies the problem: Windows 11 has significantly higher <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-11-minimum-requirements/" target="_blank">system requirements</a> compared to previous versions of Windows, so there are a lot of unsupported PCs you can't install it on.</p>    <p>The most notable change for many is the new requirement for a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), but it also bumps the minimum RAM required to 4GB and it requires an x64-based processor, on top of having a fairly restrictive <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/cpus-compatible-windows-11/" target="_blank">list of supported CPUs</a>.</p>    <p>All of that means that many users are left without an official path to upgrade to Windows 11, which is especially frustrating now that Windows 10 has officially reached the end of its life (there's a paid upgrade program, but still). While there isn't much you can do about compatibility if you have an x86 (32-bit) CPU, you can bypass the requirements for specific CPUs or TPM support, which allows most Windows PCs to upgrade to Windows 11.</p>

Check if TPM and Secure Boot are enabled
</h2><h3>
Before you get in too deep
</h3>
<p>One thing that's worth keeping in mind before starting this process is that in some cases, your PC may have TPM or Secure Boot support (another Windows 11 requirement), but it's disabled in the BIOS, so first, you should make sure <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-enable-secure-boot-windows-11/" target="_blank">Secure Boot is enabled</a> alongside TPM. Here's how:</p>        <ol>
<li>
Open the Start menu. If you can't access Windows, read <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-enter-bios-windows-pc/" target="_blank">this article</a> on how to access the BIOS on different devices.
</li>
<li>
While holding <strong>Shift</strong> on your keyboard, open the power menu and choose <strong>Restart</strong>, then confirm your choice.
</li>
<li>
Your computer will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment. Here, choose, <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, followed by <strong>Advanced options</strong> and finally <strong>UEFI Firmware settings</strong>.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Windows Recovery Environment with UEFI Firmware Settings option highlighted" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/04/windows-recovery-environment-uefi-firmware-settings.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Confirm your choice and your computer will restart.
</li>
<li>
In the BIOS, look for options called <strong>Secure Boot</strong> or <strong>TPM</strong> (the latter may also be called <strong>Security Device</strong>). Enable them both. Some computers may have a firmware TPM (fTPM), but this should still work.
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-0-1887929944" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-0-1887929944" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-0-1887929944" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-0-1887929944" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-0-1887929944-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Save your changes and restart the computer.
</li>
</ol>
<p>After this, you may be able to install Windows 11 on your PC through the usual methods. If you don't find these settings, they might not be supported, which is where this guide comes in.</p>    <p>Bear in mind that if you install Windows 11 on an unsupported PC, you may not be able to get future updates. Security updates shouldn't be much of a problem, but you may end up needing to repeat this process if Microsoft releases a big feature update. That means you can't get these updates through Windows Update, but rather, you have to download a full ISO and repeat all these steps again. Additionally, some unsupported hardware has a good reason not to be supported. Performance and stability may not be the best on some older PCs, and at some point, it's best to just buy a new computer.</p>    <h2>
Bypass system requirements with Rufus
</h2><h3>
Create a custom, bootable USB drive
</h3>
<p>Rufus is a very useful tool for creating bootable installation drives for Windows and other operating systems. It's been around for a long time, and with Windows 11, the developer actually added some features to make it easier to install the new OS on unsupported machines, since it can bypass TPM, Secure Boot, and RAM requirements.</p>    <p>For this, you'll need a USB flash drive with nothing on it (or data you don't care about losing), but otherwise, this is easily the best method for anyone to use. If the USB drive has important data, <strong>be sure to create a backup</strong> before you start.</p>    <p>Here's what you need to do to get this working:</p>        <ol>
<li>
Start by downloading an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11" target="_blank">ISO file for Windows 11 on this page</a>. The option to download an ISO is the third one, but you can also create an ISO using the Media Creation Tool on this page.
</li>
<li>
Download the latest version of <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/" target="_blank">Rufus from the official website</a>. It comes in both installable and portable versions, and you can use whatever you prefer.
</li>
<li>
Plug in the USB flash drive you're going to use as installation media.
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>We'd recommend unplugging any other drives so you don't risk erasing them by accident.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section>
</li>
<li>
Launch Rufus, and pay attention to the options you'll see here. Start by choosing the right flash drive under <strong>Device</strong> near the top.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Rufus with a USB drive selected for Windows 11 installation media" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/rufus-with-drive-selected-1.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=474&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Under <strong>Boot selection</strong> click the <strong>Select</strong> button and look for the ISO file you downloaded. A few default settings will be applied, and you shouldn't need to change them. You can change the name of the drive if you want it to be easier to identify, though.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Rufus with the select button highlighted choose an ISO file from which to create installation media" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/rufus-with-drive-selected.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=474&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Click <strong>Start</strong> at the bottom of the window.
</li>
<li>
You'll see a prompt with a series of options, but the only one you need is at the top. This will disable all the compatibility checks for Secure Boot, TPM, specific CPUs, and even RAM (though we still wouldn't recommend installing Windows 11 if you don't meet the RAM requirements). It should be enabled by default, but if it isn't, make sure to enable it.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of installation customization options in Rufus, with the requirements for 4GB of RAM, Secure Boot, and TPM 2.0 removed" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/rufus-customiye-installation.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=548&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
You may also want to select the option to remove the requirement for an online Microsoft account.
</li>
<li>
Click <strong>OK</strong> and Rufus will start moving the Windows 11 installation files to the flash drive. This process can take a while, especially if you have a slower USB port.
</li>
<li>
When the process is finished, you'll have a USB flash drive that you can use to install Windows 11 on almost any PC that doesn't meet the requirements. Open the USB drive and launch the <strong>setup</strong> file to begin the installation.
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>Alternatively, you can use the USB drive as a boot device if you want to perform a clean install. For that, check out our guide on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/download-windows-11/#how-to-install-windows-11-using-a-usb-drive" target="_blank">how to install Windows 11</a> where we explore that specific path.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section>
</li>
<li>
Follow the installation process as normal. Click <strong>Accept </strong>when you see the Windows 11 license terms, and then <strong>Install</strong> when you see the summary screen for the installation options. Windows 11 will begin installing.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once it finishes installing, you may see some additional configuration steps, but after that, you'll be on the Windows 11 desktop. You're ready to use Windows 11 as you would on an officially supported PC. But you'll have to keep in mind that some of these requirements exist for a reason, so some older hardware may experience poor performance or stability.</p>    <h2>
Bypassing requirements with the Registry Editor
</h2><h3>
For older TPMs or CPUs
</h3>
<p>One way you can try to bypass the system requirements for Windows 11 is to modify some registry values on your PC using the Registry Editor. Using the Registry Editor isn't something we recommend inexperienced users do, but if you know how to get around and you follow the steps below, you should be able to do this without much of a problem.</p>    <p>This method is ideal if you have an older TPM (such as a TPM 1.2) or if the only problem you're facing is having a supported CPU. It's not going to work for PCs with no TPM at all or to bypass other requirements.</p>    <p>Either way, the first thing you'll want to do is download an ISO for Windows 11, just like we did for the method above. Then follow these steps:</p>        <ol>
<li>
Open the Start menu and type <strong>regedit</strong>, then choose the first search result.
</li>
<li>
The Registry Editor should open. On the left-side pane, navigate to <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Right-click the empty space on the right and select <strong>New</strong>, then <strong>DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong>. Name it <strong>AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU</strong>.
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-0-792335921" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-0-792335921" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-0-792335921" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-0-792335921" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-0-792335921-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Double-click it and set the value to 1, then click <strong>OK</strong>.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Registry Editor when modifying an hexadecimal value to be 1" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/windows-10-upgrade-registry-trick-3.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Now, double-click the ISO file you downloaded to mount it as a virtual drive.
</li>
<li>
The drive should automatically open after mounting it, or you can find it on the <strong>This PC</strong> page. Run the <strong>setup</strong> file inside and begin the installation.
</li>
</ol>
<p>If your only hurdle was CPU compatibility or having an older TPM, the installation should now proceed as normal. If that still doesn't work, it may be because your PC has no TPM whatsoever, which may be the case for many custom-built PCs, for example. In that case, you'll need to try one of the other methods.</p>    <p>Keep in mind, however, that starting with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-11-24h2/" target="_blank">Windows 11 version 24H2</a>, certain very old CPUs do not work with Windows 11 anymore. Specifically, CPUs that don't support SSE 4.2 instructions (specifically, POPCNT) simply won't boot Windows 11 no matter what. So if your PC is older than 2008, it probably won't work, even with these steps.</p>    <h2>
Bypass requirements with Registry Editor during setup
</h2><h3>
Bypass TPM and Secure Boot checks
</h3>
<p>If you've already created a standard Windows 11 USB drive and don't want to redo that process to bypass the checks, and you can't access Windows on your PC to run the steps above, there's one final solution that can help. Running Registry Editor during the setup process always you to completely bypass TPM and Secure Boot checks, which makes this a great method for desktop PCs without a TPM. Here's how it works.</p>        <ol>
<li>
Insert the USB flash drive into the computer and boot from it.
</li>
<li>
When you get to the language selection screen, press <strong>Shift + F10</strong> to open Command Prompt.
</li>
<li>
Type in the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong> to open the Registry Editor: <pre>regedit</pre>
<div>

</div>
</li>
<li>
In Registry Editor, navigate to this location using the sidebar: <pre>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup</pre>
</li>
<li>
Right-click the <strong>Setup</strong> folder and choose <strong>New &gt; Key</strong>.
<div>

</div>
</li>
<li>
Name the new key <strong>LabConfig</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.

<li>
Select the LabConfig folder and right-click an empty area of the main pane, then choose <strong>New &gt; DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong>.

</li>
<li>
Name the value <strong>BypassTPMCheck</strong> and press<strong> Enter</strong>.

It's time to say goodbye to Windows 10
</h3>
<p>With Windows 10 reaching the end of its support period, upgrading to Windows 11 is highly recommended. There are many reasons why Windows 11 may not run on your specific PC, but this workaround with Rufus is currently the best way to fix all of them. There are some things you can't work around, but most of the big new requirements for Windows 11 can be bypassed this way. It does require a USB drive, which not everyone will have, but it's worth it for the ease of use and the low level of risk. If you really don't want to get a USB drive, the other solutions should also help you.</p>    <p>As we mentioned above, starting with Windows 11 version 24H2, Microsoft will be requiring support for the POPCNT instruction in processors, and they won't be able to boot Windows 11 at all. This will only affect very old CPUs (pre-2008), so just about any decently <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-laptops/" target="_blank">modern laptop</a> should still work with the steps above. Of course, the best way to get Windows 11 is probably to buy a new PC that supports it out of the box, but these workarounds are a good way to breathe some life into an old computer you may have at home.</p>]]>

Check if TPM and Secure Boot are enabled
</h2><h3>
Before you get in too deep
</h3>
<p>One thing that's worth keeping in mind before starting this process is that in some cases, your PC may have TPM or Secure Boot support (another Windows 11 requirement), but it's disabled in the BIOS, so first, you should make sure <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-enable-secure-boot-windows-11/" target="_blank">Secure Boot is enabled</a> alongside TPM. Here's how:</p>        <ol>
<li>
Open the Start menu. If you can't access Windows, read <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-enter-bios-windows-pc/" target="_blank">this article</a> on how to access the BIOS on different devices.
</li>
<li>
While holding <strong>Shift</strong> on your keyboard, open the power menu and choose <strong>Restart</strong>, then confirm your choice.
</li>
<li>
Your computer will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment. Here, choose, <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, followed by <strong>Advanced options</strong> and finally <strong>UEFI Firmware settings</strong>.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Windows Recovery Environment with UEFI Firmware Settings option highlighted" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/04/windows-recovery-environment-uefi-firmware-settings.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Confirm your choice and your computer will restart.
</li>
<li>
In the BIOS, look for options called <strong>Secure Boot</strong> or <strong>TPM</strong> (the latter may also be called <strong>Security Device</strong>). Enable them both. Some computers may have a firmware TPM (fTPM), but this should still work.
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-0-1887929944" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-0-1887929944" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-0-1887929944" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-0-1887929944" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-0-1887929944-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Save your changes and restart the computer.
</li>
</ol>
<p>After this, you may be able to install Windows 11 on your PC through the usual methods. If you don't find these settings, they might not be supported, which is where this guide comes in.</p>    <p>Bear in mind that if you install Windows 11 on an unsupported PC, you may not be able to get future updates. Security updates shouldn't be much of a problem, but you may end up needing to repeat this process if Microsoft releases a big feature update. That means you can't get these updates through Windows Update, but rather, you have to download a full ISO and repeat all these steps again. Additionally, some unsupported hardware has a good reason not to be supported. Performance and stability may not be the best on some older PCs, and at some point, it's best to just buy a new computer.</p>    <h2>
Bypass system requirements with Rufus
</h2><h3>
Create a custom, bootable USB drive
</h3>
<p>Rufus is a very useful tool for creating bootable installation drives for Windows and other operating systems. It's been around for a long time, and with Windows 11, the developer actually added some features to make it easier to install the new OS on unsupported machines, since it can bypass TPM, Secure Boot, and RAM requirements.</p>    <p>For this, you'll need a USB flash drive with nothing on it (or data you don't care about losing), but otherwise, this is easily the best method for anyone to use. If the USB drive has important data, <strong>be sure to create a backup</strong> before you start.</p>    <p>Here's what you need to do to get this working:</p>        <ol>
<li>
Start by downloading an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11" target="_blank">ISO file for Windows 11 on this page</a>. The option to download an ISO is the third one, but you can also create an ISO using the Media Creation Tool on this page.
</li>
<li>
Download the latest version of <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/" target="_blank">Rufus from the official website</a>. It comes in both installable and portable versions, and you can use whatever you prefer.
</li>
<li>
Plug in the USB flash drive you're going to use as installation media.
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>We'd recommend unplugging any other drives so you don't risk erasing them by accident.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section>
</li>
<li>
Launch Rufus, and pay attention to the options you'll see here. Start by choosing the right flash drive under <strong>Device</strong> near the top.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Rufus with a USB drive selected for Windows 11 installation media" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/rufus-with-drive-selected-1.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=474&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Under <strong>Boot selection</strong> click the <strong>Select</strong> button and look for the ISO file you downloaded. A few default settings will be applied, and you shouldn't need to change them. You can change the name of the drive if you want it to be easier to identify, though.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Rufus with the select button highlighted choose an ISO file from which to create installation media" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/rufus-with-drive-selected.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=474&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Click <strong>Start</strong> at the bottom of the window.
</li>
<li>
You'll see a prompt with a series of options, but the only one you need is at the top. This will disable all the compatibility checks for Secure Boot, TPM, specific CPUs, and even RAM (though we still wouldn't recommend installing Windows 11 if you don't meet the RAM requirements). It should be enabled by default, but if it isn't, make sure to enable it.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of installation customization options in Rufus, with the requirements for 4GB of RAM, Secure Boot, and TPM 2.0 removed" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/rufus-customiye-installation.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=548&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
You may also want to select the option to remove the requirement for an online Microsoft account.
</li>
<li>
Click <strong>OK</strong> and Rufus will start moving the Windows 11 installation files to the flash drive. This process can take a while, especially if you have a slower USB port.
</li>
<li>
When the process is finished, you'll have a USB flash drive that you can use to install Windows 11 on almost any PC that doesn't meet the requirements. Open the USB drive and launch the <strong>setup</strong> file to begin the installation.
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>Alternatively, you can use the USB drive as a boot device if you want to perform a clean install. For that, check out our guide on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/download-windows-11/#how-to-install-windows-11-using-a-usb-drive" target="_blank">how to install Windows 11</a> where we explore that specific path.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section>
</li>
<li>
Follow the installation process as normal. Click <strong>Accept </strong>when you see the Windows 11 license terms, and then <strong>Install</strong> when you see the summary screen for the installation options. Windows 11 will begin installing.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once it finishes installing, you may see some additional configuration steps, but after that, you'll be on the Windows 11 desktop. You're ready to use Windows 11 as you would on an officially supported PC. But you'll have to keep in mind that some of these requirements exist for a reason, so some older hardware may experience poor performance or stability.</p>    <h2>
Bypassing requirements with the Registry Editor
</h2><h3>
For older TPMs or CPUs
</h3>
<p>One way you can try to bypass the system requirements for Windows 11 is to modify some registry values on your PC using the Registry Editor. Using the Registry Editor isn't something we recommend inexperienced users do, but if you know how to get around and you follow the steps below, you should be able to do this without much of a problem.</p>    <p>This method is ideal if you have an older TPM (such as a TPM 1.2) or if the only problem you're facing is having a supported CPU. It's not going to work for PCs with no TPM at all or to bypass other requirements.</p>    <p>Either way, the first thing you'll want to do is download an ISO for Windows 11, just like we did for the method above. Then follow these steps:</p>        <ol>
<li>
Open the Start menu and type <strong>regedit</strong>, then choose the first search result.
</li>
<li>
The Registry Editor should open. On the left-side pane, navigate to <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Right-click the empty space on the right and select <strong>New</strong>, then <strong>DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong>. Name it <strong>AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU</strong>.
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-0-792335921" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-0-792335921" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-0-792335921" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-0-792335921" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-0-792335921-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Double-click it and set the value to 1, then click <strong>OK</strong>.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Registry Editor when modifying an hexadecimal value to be 1" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/windows-10-upgrade-registry-trick-3.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Now, double-click the ISO file you downloaded to mount it as a virtual drive.
</li>
<li>
The drive should automatically open after mounting it, or you can find it on the <strong>This PC</strong> page. Run the <strong>setup</strong> file inside and begin the installation.
</li>
</ol>
<p>If your only hurdle was CPU compatibility or having an older TPM, the installation should now proceed as normal. If that still doesn't work, it may be because your PC has no TPM whatsoever, which may be the case for many custom-built PCs, for example. In that case, you'll need to try one of the other methods.</p>    <p>Keep in mind, however, that starting with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-11-24h2/" target="_blank">Windows 11 version 24H2</a>, certain very old CPUs do not work with Windows 11 anymore. Specifically, CPUs that don't support SSE 4.2 instructions (specifically, POPCNT) simply won't boot Windows 11 no matter what. So if your PC is older than 2008, it probably won't work, even with these steps.</p>    <h2>
Bypass requirements with Registry Editor during setup
</h2><h3>
Bypass TPM and Secure Boot checks
</h3>
<p>If you've already created a standard Windows 11 USB drive and don't want to redo that process to bypass the checks, and you can't access Windows on your PC to run the steps above, there's one final solution that can help. Running Registry Editor during the setup process always you to completely bypass TPM and Secure Boot checks, which makes this a great method for desktop PCs without a TPM. Here's how it works.</p>        <ol>
<li>
Insert the USB flash drive into the computer and boot from it.
</li>
<li>
When you get to the language selection screen, press <strong>Shift + F10</strong> to open Command Prompt.
</li>
<li>
Type in the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong> to open the Registry Editor: <pre>regedit</pre>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Command prompt during Windows 11 Setup with the regedit command" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/windows-11-setup-command-prompt.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</li>
<li>
In Registry Editor, navigate to this location using the sidebar: <pre>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup</pre>
</li>
<li>
Right-click the <strong>Setup</strong> folder and choose <strong>New &gt; Key</strong>.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Registry Editor in Windows 11 Setup with the option to create a new key highlighted" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/windows-11-setup-registry-new-key-1.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Name the new key <strong>LabConfig</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Select the LabConfig folder and right-click an empty area of the main pane, then choose <strong>New &gt; DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong>.
<div>

</li>
<li>
Name the value <strong>BypassTPMCheck</strong> and press<strong> Enter</strong>.

If you don't find these settings, they might not be supported, which is where this guide comes in.</p>    <p>Bear in mind that if you install Windows 11 on an unsupported PC, you may not be able to get future updates. Security updates shouldn't be much of a problem, but you may end up needing to repeat this process if Microsoft releases a big feature update. That means you can't get these updates through Windows Update, but rather, you have to download a full ISO and repeat all these steps again. Additionally, some unsupported hardware has a good reason not to be supported. Performance and stability may not be the best on some older PCs, and at some point, it's best to just buy a new computer.</p>    <h2>
Bypass system requirements with Rufus
</h2><h3>
Create a custom, bootable USB drive
</h3>
<p>Rufus is a very useful tool for creating bootable installation drives for Windows and other operating systems. It's been around for a long time, and with Windows 11, the developer actually added some features to make it easier to install the new OS on unsupported machines, since it can bypass TPM, Secure Boot, and RAM requirements.</p>    <p>For this, you'll need a USB flash drive with nothing on it (or data you don't care about losing), but otherwise, this is easily the best method for anyone to use. If the USB drive has important data, <strong>be sure to create a backup</strong> before you start.</p>    <p>Here's what you need to do to get this working:</p>        <ol>
<li>
Start by downloading an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11" target="_blank">ISO file for Windows 11 on this page</a>. The option to download an ISO is the third one, but you can also create an ISO using the Media Creation Tool on this page.
</li>
<li>
Download the latest version of <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/" target="_blank">Rufus from the official website</a>. It comes in both installable and portable versions, and you can use whatever you prefer.
</li>
<li>
Plug in the USB flash drive you're going to use as installation media.
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>We'd recommend unplugging any other drives so you don't risk erasing them by accident.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section>
</li>
<li>
Launch Rufus, and pay attention to the options you'll see here. Start by choosing the right flash drive under <strong>Device</strong> near the top.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Rufus with a USB drive selected for Windows 11 installation media" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/rufus-with-drive-selected-1.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=474&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Under <strong>Boot selection</strong> click the <strong>Select</strong> button and look for the ISO file you downloaded. A few default settings will be applied, and you shouldn't need to change them. You can change the name of the drive if you want it to be easier to identify, though.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Rufus with the select button highlighted choose an ISO file from which to create installation media" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/rufus-with-drive-selected.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=474&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Click <strong>Start</strong> at the bottom of the window.
</li>
<li>
You'll see a prompt with a series of options, but the only one you need is at the top. This will disable all the compatibility checks for Secure Boot, TPM, specific CPUs, and even RAM (though we still wouldn't recommend installing Windows 11 if you don't meet the RAM requirements). It should be enabled by default, but if it isn't, make sure to enable it.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of installation customization options in Rufus, with the requirements for 4GB of RAM, Secure Boot, and TPM 2.0 removed" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/rufus-customiye-installation.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=548&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
You may also want to select the option to remove the requirement for an online Microsoft account.
</li>
<li>
Click <strong>OK</strong> and Rufus will start moving the Windows 11 installation files to the flash drive. This process can take a while, especially if you have a slower USB port.
</li>
<li>
When the process is finished, you'll have a USB flash drive that you can use to install Windows 11 on almost any PC that doesn't meet the requirements. Open the USB drive and launch the <strong>setup</strong> file to begin the installation.
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>Alternatively, you can use the USB drive as a boot device if you want to perform a clean install. For that, check out our guide on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/download-windows-11/#how-to-install-windows-11-using-a-usb-drive" target="_blank">how to install Windows 11</a> where we explore that specific path.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section>
</li>
<li>
Follow the installation process as normal. Click <strong>Accept </strong>when you see the Windows 11 license terms, and then <strong>Install</strong> when you see the summary screen for the installation options. Windows 11 will begin installing.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once it finishes installing, you may see some additional configuration steps, but after that, you'll be on the Windows 11 desktop. You're ready to use Windows 11 as you would on an officially supported PC. But you'll have to keep in mind that some of these requirements exist for a reason, so some older hardware may experience poor performance or stability.</p>    <h2>
Bypassing requirements with the Registry Editor
</h2><h3>
For older TPMs or CPUs
</h3>
<p>One way you can try to bypass the system requirements for Windows 11 is to modify some registry values on your PC using the Registry Editor. Using the Registry Editor isn't something we recommend inexperienced users do, but if you know how to get around and you follow the steps below, you should be able to do this without much of a problem.</p>    <p>This method is ideal if you have an older TPM (such as a TPM 1.2) or if the only problem you're facing is having a supported CPU. It's not going to work for PCs with no TPM at all or to bypass other requirements.</p>    <p>Either way, the first thing you'll want to do is download an ISO for Windows 11, just like we did for the method above. Then follow these steps:</p>        <ol>
<li>
Open the Start menu and type <strong>regedit</strong>, then choose the first search result.
</li>
<li>
The Registry Editor should open. On the left-side pane, navigate to <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Right-click the empty space on the right and select <strong>New</strong>, then <strong>DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong>. Name it <strong>AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU</strong>.
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-0-792335921" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-0-792335921" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-0-792335921" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-0-792335921" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-0-792335921-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Double-click it and set the value to 1, then click <strong>OK</strong>.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Registry Editor when modifying an hexadecimal value to be 1" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/12/windows-10-upgrade-registry-trick-3.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Now, double-click the ISO file you downloaded to mount it as a virtual drive.
</li>
<li>
The drive should automatically open after mounting it, or you can find it on the <strong>This PC</strong> page. Run the <strong>setup</strong> file inside and begin the installation.
</li>
</ol>
<p>If your only hurdle was CPU compatibility or having an older TPM, the installation should now proceed as normal. If that still doesn't work, it may be because your PC has no TPM whatsoever, which may be the case for many custom-built PCs, for example. In that case, you'll need to try one of the other methods.</p>    <p>Keep in mind, however, that starting with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-11-24h2/" target="_blank">Windows 11 version 24H2</a>, certain very old CPUs do not work with Windows 11 anymore. Specifically, CPUs that don't support SSE 4.2 instructions (specifically, POPCNT) simply won't boot Windows 11 no matter what. So if your PC is older than 2008, it probably won't work, even with these steps.</p>    <h2>
Bypass requirements with Registry Editor during setup
</h2><h3>
Bypass TPM and Secure Boot checks
</h3>
<p>If you've already created a standard Windows 11 USB drive and don't want to redo that process to bypass the checks, and you can't access Windows on your PC to run the steps above, there's one final solution that can help. Running Registry Editor during the setup process always you to completely bypass TPM and Secure Boot checks, which makes this a great method for desktop PCs without a TPM. Here's how it works.</p>        <ol>
<li>
Insert the USB flash drive into the computer and boot from it.
</li>
<li>
When you get to the language selection screen, press <strong>Shift + F10</strong> to open Command Prompt.
</li>
<li>
Type in the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong> to open the Registry Editor: <pre>regedit</pre>
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Command prompt during Windows 11 Setup with the regedit command" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/windows-11-setup-command-prompt.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</li>
<li>
In Registry Editor, navigate to this location using the sidebar: <pre>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup</pre>
</li>
<li>
Right-click the <strong>Setup</strong> folder and choose <strong>New &gt; Key</strong>.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Registry Editor in Windows 11 Setup with the option to create a new key highlighted" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/windows-11-setup-registry-new-key-1.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Name the new key <strong>LabConfig</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Select the LabConfig folder and right-click an empty area of the main pane, then choose <strong>New &gt; DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong>.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Registry Editor during Windows 11 setup with the option to create a new value highlighted" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/windows-11-setup-new-dword-1.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Name the value <strong>BypassTPMCheck</strong> and press<strong> Enter</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Double-click the value you created and change the <strong>Value data</strong> field to <strong>1</strong>. Leave the base as <strong>Hexadecimal</strong>.
<div>
<img alt="Screenshot of Registry Editor showing the BypassTPMCheck value set to 1" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/windows-11-bypass-tpm-check.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Click <strong>OK</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Right-click an empty area again and choose <strong>New &gt; Dword (32-bit) Value</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Name this new value <strong>BypassSecureBootCheck</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Double-click the new value change the <strong>Value data</strong> to <strong>1</strong>, keeping the base as <strong>Hexadecimal</strong>. Click <strong>OK</strong>.
<div>
<img alt="Windows 11 Bypass Secure Boot Check" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/windows-11-bypass-secure-boot-check.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</li>
<li>
Close Registry Editor and Command Prompt, and you can now follow the installation process as normal.
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the hurdle you were running into had to do with the TPM or Secure Boot support, this workaround should fix things for you. However, this won't work around things like not having enough RAM. The best and most effective way to circumvent that is still to use Rufus.</p>    <h3>
It's time to say goodbye to Windows 10
</h3>
<p>With Windows 10 reaching the end of its support period, upgrading to Windows 11 is highly recommended. There are many reasons why Windows 11 may not run on your specific PC, but this workaround with Rufus is currently the best way to fix all of them. There are some things you can't work around, but most of the big new requirements for Windows 11 can be bypassed this way. It does require a USB drive, which not everyone will have, but it's worth it for the ease of use and the low level of risk. If you really don't want to get a USB drive, the other solutions should also help you.</p>    <p>As we mentioned above, starting with Windows 11 version 24H2, Microsoft will be requiring support for the POPCNT instruction in processors, and they won't be able to boot Windows 11 at all. This will only affect very old CPUs (pre-2008), so just about any decently <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-laptops/" target="_blank">modern laptop</a> should still work with the steps above. Of course, the best way to get Windows 11 is probably to buy a new PC that supports it out of the box, but these workarounds are a good way to breathe some life into an old computer you may have at home.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <![CDATA[<p>The Xbox brand is going through a rough patch with everyone after the news of changes coming to their subscription service. The price of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/doom-the-dark-ages-proves-what-we-all-knew-day-one-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales" target="_blank">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> was increased drastically, which drew the ire of many gamers online, who felt the increase was astronomical and unnecessary. Although Xbox justified the reason for the price increase by showing the amount of games coming to the service and the additional features that Game Pass Ultimate subscribers would have, it wasn't enough to quell the overwhelmingly negative response to the news. And for some who have stuck with the Xbox ecosystem for a long time, it may have been the final straw.</p>    <p>Online threads and forums began flooding with people talking about canceling their Game Pass subscription as a form of protest to the company increasing the price of the service. Things got so bad because of so many people canceling, the web page for the Xbox website to cancel subscriptions started to have errors and become broken. Discussion about Xbox's commitment to gamers who have continuously supported the company was called into question, especially after changing what many considered to be the best deal and value in the industry, and the biggest reason to engage with Xbox as a brand. But with the price change going into effect and the anger from gamers looming online, some people may be jumping ship to other places to get their gaming fix. Here's why the Xbox Game Pass price hike will convince gamers to switch over to PlayStation and Nintendo consoles.</p>    <h2>
New Game Pass pricing hits hard
</h2><h3>
Too expensive as a subscription for most
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1168070363" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1168070363" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1168070363" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1168070363" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1168070363-img" data-gallery-type="">

</div>
<p>Most subscription services within entertainment end up landing on a similar price point that customers have grown accustomed to. Whether you're watching movies and TV shows on Netflix or HBO Max, or getting a premium subscription to platforms like YouTube, you may end up paying a similar price wherever you go. This was the same thing for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which cost gamers around $19.99 through the digital store or at retail. For most people, it was a good sales price for the amount of games you gain <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/6-things-you-can-connect-to-the-usb-port-on-your-xbox" target="_blank">access to on Xbox Series X/S</a> or PC. And while other platforms had their own services with access to games digitally through downloads and streaming, Game Pass Ultimate was considered the best value for gamers who wanted access to new games on launch day, as well as a backlog of titles to explore anytime they wanted.</p>    <p>But with the increase in price for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, that perception has seemingly gone away. It's very hard to justify someone paying $30 every month for a subscription service, especially if it doesn't involve a cellphone or brand-new vehicle in some way. The new price is more than most other streaming services that people often use, with the most expensive currently being Netflix and their 4K premium tier for movies and television shows. Despite Game Pass Ultimate having access to so <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/using-playstation-plus-and-xbox-game-pass-better-choice" target="_blank">many games to download to a console</a>, the majority of people will not play most of the 400 titles that the service offers through Game Pass Ultimate, making it even harder to justify the new price. And forcing everyone to pay it is not going to help, especially for those who have been subscribers for a long time already.</p>

</div>
<p> The announcement from Xbox came with news that in-game rewards for titles from Riot Games and other perks for games like Fortnite would be included, along with unlimited cloud gaming and an assortment of Ubisoft and EA classics. But none of these things are potent enough to convince gamers that the new price is justifiable, or offer enough value to stick with the service throughout the year. Most of the extra perks aren't helpful if someone doesn't play Fortnite, or doesn't play old EA and Ubisoft games. Even with the more than 75 day one releases that are accessible on launch as a subscriber, most of them will not be major titles people would be interested in.</p>    <h2>
PlayStation Plus looks more appealing now
</h2><h3>
Greater value over on PSN
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1307079590" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1307079590" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1307079590" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1307079590" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1307079590-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>The closest comparison to Game Pass would be PlayStation Plus, and more specifically the Premium and Extra tiers of the service. These give subscribers access to an assortment of games from the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/3-more-fighting-game-classics-playstation-plus-should-add-to-the-ps-classics-catalog" target="_blank">PlayStation Plus and Classics catalog</a>, which adds more games periodically throughout the year. It's a very similar approach to what Xbox Game Pass did, but with a very different selection of titles that cater more to PlayStation gamers, rather than just the biggest releases. And the price for the highest tier is $17.99 per month, which gives access to everything and looks much more appealing to gamers looking to be smarter with their monthly budget.</p>    <p>The new price change for Xbox Game Pass gives every reason for players to cancel their subscription and switch over to PlayStation Plus. It's not only cheaper, but has <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-playstation-5-games-from-playstation-plus-premium-catalog" target="_blank">enough major games to draw the attention</a> of casual players, even if it doesn't have day one releases. Most of the major games that come out are usually purchased by gamers who were already interested in them, whether they were available through Xbox Game Pass or not. But the benefit that PlayStation has is how many of the major hits for the brand are available in the PS Plus catalog already, offering a pretty substantial list of games someone can get if they just got their console without having to make additional purchases.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p> But in addition to that, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/playstation-classics-you-need-to-download" target="_blank">the Classics Catalog</a> on PlayStation Plus is a wide range of exclusive titles that don't appear anywhere else. If the perks offered with a subscription matter the most for the price you pay, then PlayStation Plus Premium is going to be a smarter option over Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now. There's no real argument to make against someone paying half the price and getting so much more value. It's basically the original way that Game Pass operated, but with an entirely different selection of games.</p>    <h2>
Switch Online appears even better
</h2><h3>
A low price for the whole year
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-742235130" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-742235130" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-742235130" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-742235130" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-742235130-img" data-gallery-type="">

<p>Although some may still find Nintendo to be very frugal with their games and services, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/nintendo-switch-2-online-launch-experience-impressions" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch Online</a> also looks better with the Xbox Game Pass changes. For some people, it's hard to jump into the Nintendo ecosystem because third-party games are often better to play elsewhere, despite Nintendo first-party games being as good as they are. But having a Nintendo Switch 2 with Switch Online is the most price-efficient subscription that gamers could get. Paying $49.99 gives access to online multiplayer, the GameChat feature on Switch 2, and the ability to play any of the Nintendo Classics (all platforms) included with the service for the entire year. One payment, for the whole year.</p>    <p>While Switch Online lacks anything involving day one releases, the price point is significantly lower than the other two platforms. And the one-time payment for the Switch Online Expansion gives everything that the service offers for the entire year, which may be more than enough for families who play games together. The entire catalog of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/these-nintendo-64-games-need-to-be-added-to-the-nintendo-switch-online-mature-app-next" target="_blank">classics for Nintendo 64</a>, NES, Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, GameCube, and Game Boy titles is a very big deal, even if you didn't grow up playing those games on those systems. It's a much better deal than paying $30 every month, even if you never play most of the games that the classics section offers.</p>

<h3>
Switching sides after everything
</h3>
<p>The sad truth is that Xbox is making it harder for Xbox fans to continue supporting them. Gaming is getting more expensive, and people are trying to find different ways to keep engaging with the hobby without paying too much and breaking their bank accounts. Most gamers are convinced that what is being done <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-saved-money-on-these-3-big-games-by-playing-them-through-xbox-game-pass" target="_blank">with Xbox Game Pass</a> is the wrong move for the company, and it's giving everyone reasons to look elsewhere to play games. Die-hard Xbox fans may stay as long as they can, but eventually it'll be harder for them to stick around with Xbox as time goes on. The mass cancellation of subscriptions to Xbox Game Pass should be enough for the company to get the message that gamers are sending them, but it may end up leading to Xbox handing their competition an audience who would've otherwise still supported them without the price hike.</p>]]>

It's very hard to justify someone paying $30 every month for a subscription service, especially if it doesn't involve a cellphone or brand-new vehicle in some way. The new price is more than most other streaming services that people often use, with the most expensive currently being Netflix and their 4K premium tier for movies and television shows. Despite Game Pass Ultimate having access to so <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/using-playstation-plus-and-xbox-game-pass-better-choice" target="_blank">many games to download to a console</a>, the majority of people will not play most of the 400 titles that the service offers through Game Pass Ultimate, making it even harder to justify the new price. And forcing everyone to pay it is not going to help, especially for those who have been subscribers for a long time already.</p>

<p>The sad truth is that Xbox is making it harder for Xbox fans to continue supporting them. Gaming is getting more expensive, and people are trying to find different ways to keep engaging with the hobby without paying too much and breaking their bank accounts. Most gamers are convinced that what is being done <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-saved-money-on-these-3-big-games-by-playing-them-through-xbox-game-pass" target="_blank">with Xbox Game Pass</a> is the wrong move for the company, and it's giving everyone reasons to look elsewhere to play games. Die-hard Xbox fans may stay as long as they can, but eventually it'll be harder for them to stick around with Xbox as time goes on. The mass cancellation of subscriptions to Xbox Game Pass should be enough for the company to get the message that gamers are sending them, but it may end up leading to Xbox handing their competition an audience who would've otherwise still supported them without the price hike.</p>]]>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Xbox brand is going through a rough patch with everyone after the news of changes coming to their subscription service. The price of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/doom-the-dark-ages-proves-what-we-all-knew-day-one-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales" target="_blank">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> was increased drastically, which drew the ire of many gamers online, who felt the increase was astronomical and unnecessary. Although Xbox justified the reason for the price increase by showing the amount of games coming to the service and the additional features that Game Pass Ultimate subscribers would have, it wasn't enough to quell the overwhelmingly negative response to the news. And for some who have stuck with the Xbox ecosystem for a long time, it may have been the final straw.</p>    <p>Online threads and forums began flooding with people talking about canceling their Game Pass subscription as a form of protest to the company increasing the price of the service. Things got so bad because of so many people canceling, the web page for the Xbox website to cancel subscriptions started to have errors and become broken. Discussion about Xbox's commitment to gamers who have continuously supported the company was called into question, especially after changing what many considered to be the best deal and value in the industry, and the biggest reason to engage with Xbox as a brand. But with the price change going into effect and the anger from gamers looming online, some people may be jumping ship to other places to get their gaming fix. Here's why the Xbox Game Pass price hike will convince gamers to switch over to PlayStation and Nintendo consoles.</p>    <h2>

    <itunes:summary>
      <![CDATA[<p>Steam on Linux has come a long way since its early days. Thanks to Proton, it’s now possible to play thousands of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/linux-is-slowly-taking-over-my-life-as-a-pc-gamer/" target="_blank">Windows games on Linux</a> with just a few clicks. Even so, the overall experience isn’t as polished as it should be. Persistent bugs, display quirks, and a handful of outdated design choices continue to frustrate users.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>Valve has done more for Linux gaming than any other company, but these unresolved issues make Steam feel unfinished.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>These aren’t minor inconveniences. Some of these issues make Steam feel unreliable, and others make it seem disconnected from how modern Linux systems work. If Valve wants Steam to feel like a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gaming-linux-it-record-high-steam/" target="_blank">premium experience on Linux</a>, these long-standing issues need genuine attention.</p>    <h2>
Steam disables your screensaver and never turns it back on
</h2><h3>
A long-standing bug that messes with power management
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-896266125" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-896266125" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-896266125" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-896266125" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-896266125-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the most frustrating issues with Steam on Linux is its interference with screensavers and power management settings for displays. When you start Steam or launch a game, it disables your screensaver and display sleep features, which makes sense during gameplay. The problem is that it rarely restores those settings afterward. Once you close the client, your screensaver stays disabled until you log out or restart your computer. That’s not how a well-behaved desktop app should work.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>I’ve tried numerous fixes for this issue, including the addition of a command-line parameter that should prevent Steam from ever touching screensaver settings. None has proven a consistent fix for the issue.</p>    </div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Steam icon set to prevent screensaver disabling" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/steam-icon-set-to-prevent-screensaver-disabling.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</section><p>Reports about this issue have circulated for years in Valve’s GitHub tracker. Steam uses power inhibition to prevent screens from dimming during gameplay, but it sometimes leaves this inhibition active even when the game is idle. The Arch Linux wiki even notes this, stating that Steam disables screensavers regardless of whether a game is running. Some users launch Steam with <code>SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER=1</code> or use D-Bus commands to release inhibitor locks, but those are temporary fixes. The client should be smart enough to handle that automatically.</p>    <p>This problem might seem minor, but it’s not. It can keep your monitor awake for hours, waste energy, and shorten the display lifespan. Valve could easily fix this by refining its session logic to only inhibit screen sleep when necessary and always reset those settings when a session ends. That kind of polish is exactly what Linux users expect from a platform leader.</p>    <h2>
Scaling and DPI support are still a mess
</h2><h3>
Steam ignores or mishandles display scaling under Linux
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1682193598" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1682193598" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1682193598" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1682193598" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1682193598-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Steam’s scaling behavior is one of the most obvious signs that it still doesn’t feel native on Linux. On high-resolution or multi-monitor setups, text and icons often appear too small or stretched. The client’s own “Scale text and icons to match monitor settings” option rarely works under Wayland, and in some cases, it does nothing at all. For users with fractional scaling enabled, Steam’s interface may appear uneven and difficult to read.</p>    <p>Some of the worst cases appear when Steam runs under XWayland. The window may render at a low internal resolution and then be upscaled by the compositor, resulting in everything appearing blurry. You can work around it by running Steam through Gamescope or adjusting compositor settings, but those solutions are far from convenient. They also shouldn’t be necessary in a modern desktop environment. Valve’s other projects, such as the Steam Deck, demonstrate that it knows how to handle scaling correctly.</p>    <p>Fixing this would bring a huge improvement in usability. The Steam client should read system-level scaling values and adapt in real time, just like native Linux apps do. With so many distributions now defaulting to Wayland and high-DPI displays becoming the standard, proper scaling is no longer optional. It’s a requirement for a clean and consistent experience.</p>    <h2>
The blank client window problem won’t die
</h2><h3>
Steam sometimes launches to a completely empty screen
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A hand holding the Steam Deck." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/04/steam-deck-linux-system-1.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Another issue that’s been plaguing users for years is the infamous blank Steam window. You launch the client, log in, and instead of seeing your library or store, you get an empty gray or black screen. It’s one of those bugs that seem random but show up frequently enough to be considered persistent. Sometimes restarting the client works, and other times the only way to fix it is by launching Big Picture mode.</p>    <p>This problem has been linked to several different causes. On Wayland, GPU handoff issues and compositor quirks can prevent Steam’s Chromium-based interface from drawing correctly. On dual-GPU systems, Steam sometimes opens using the wrong GPU and fails to render altogether. Even on X11 systems, the same blank window can appear after updates or runtime changes. The fact that it’s survived so many UI revisions suggests a deeper architectural flaw.</p>    <p>Users shouldn’t have to troubleshoot their game launcher just to play games. Valve needs to make Steam’s graphical initialization more reliable and resilient to differences between drivers and compositors. When the client fails to load its own interface, it undermines user confidence and makes Linux gaming feel unstable. This should be one of the first things Valve addresses.</p>    <h2>
Proton still needs consistency improvements
</h2><h3>
Compatibility issues keep some games from launching properly
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Steam Proton settings for Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/steam-proton-settings-for-cyberpunk-2077.png?q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=1">
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/steams-latest-beta-build-gaming-on-linux-a-breeze/" target="_blank">Proton has revolutionized Linux gaming</a> by making Windows titles playable with minimal effort. It works impressively well most of the time, but when it doesn’t, the experience quickly becomes frustrating. Some games fail to launch at all, while others crash or stutter so badly they’re unplayable. The inconsistency makes it difficult for users to know what to expect from one title to the next.</p>    <p>Many players end up experimenting with different Proton versions or tweaking launch options to find a working combination. Others have had to reinstall the Steam runtime entirely just to fix missing dependencies. These issues often stem from how Steam manages compatibility layers and runtime libraries. When things break, there’s rarely any feedback to help users understand what went wrong.</p>    <p>Valve could make Proton far more dependable by integrating better error reporting and automatic troubleshooting. If the client could detect common dependency conflicts or runtime mismatches, it could automatically switch to a different version or apply patches. A <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/proton-linux-wish-switch/" target="_blank">more predictable Proton experience</a> would reduce frustration and make gaming on Linux feel as smooth as it does on Windows.</p>    <h2>
Wayland and GPU support remain unreliable
</h2><h3>
Poor integration with modern Linux desktop environments

<p>Wayland has become the default display server on most major Linux distributions, but Steam still struggles with it. Users report flickering windows, blank screens, and missing UI elements when running the client or launching games. Dual-GPU systems often confuse Steam, which may render on the wrong card or cause the system to crash entirely. This issue occurs most frequently due to a configuration entry called <code>PrefersNonDefaultGPU=true</code>, which can cause Steam to select the incorrect GPU.</p>    <p>Steam’s window scaling on Wayland also remains unreliable. On high-DPI setups, the interface often appears at half resolution and is then upscaled, resulting in blurry text and misaligned menus. Some compositors let users disable XWayland scaling to work around the problem, but that’s an unnecessary complication. Valve already solved these challenges on the Steam Deck, which uses a Wayland-based compositor with Gamescope.</p>    <p>Applying those same fixes to the desktop client would show that Valve is serious about Linux beyond the Steam Deck. Better GPU detection, proper Wayland support, and more consistent rendering would eliminate some of the most frustrating user experiences. The Linux desktop has matured quickly, and Steam needs to keep up if Valve wants to maintain its leadership in the space.</p>    <h3>
Why Valve needs to address these problems now

<p>Valve has done more for Linux gaming than any other company, but these unresolved issues make Steam feel unfinished.

<div><p>Valve has done more for Linux gaming than any other company, but these unresolved issues make Steam feel unfinished.</p>    </div>
</div>
</section><p>These aren’t minor inconveniences. Some of these issues make Steam feel unreliable, and others make it seem disconnected from how modern Linux systems work. If Valve wants Steam to feel like a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gaming-linux-it-record-high-steam/" target="_blank">premium experience on Linux</a>, these long-standing issues need genuine attention.</p>    <h2>
Steam disables your screensaver and never turns it back on
</h2><h3>
A long-standing bug that messes with power management
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-896266125" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-896266125" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-896266125" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-896266125" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-896266125-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the most frustrating issues with Steam on Linux is its interference with screensavers and power management settings for displays. When you start Steam or launch a game, it disables your screensaver and display sleep features, which makes sense during gameplay. The problem is that it rarely restores those settings afterward. Once you close the client, your screensaver stays disabled until you log out or restart your computer. That’s not how a well-behaved desktop app should work.</p>
<section data-nosnippet="">
<div>
<div><p>I’ve tried numerous fixes for this issue, including the addition of a command-line parameter that should prevent Steam from ever touching screensaver settings. None has proven a consistent fix for the issue.</p>    </div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="Steam icon set to prevent screensaver disabling" src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/10/steam-icon-set-to-prevent-screensaver-disabling.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</section><p>Reports about this issue have circulated for years in Valve’s GitHub tracker. Steam uses power inhibition to prevent screens from dimming during gameplay, but it sometimes leaves this inhibition active even when the game is idle. The Arch Linux wiki even notes this, stating that Steam disables screensavers regardless of whether a game is running. Some users launch Steam with <code>SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER=1</code> or use D-Bus commands to release inhibitor locks, but those are temporary fixes. The client should be smart enough to handle that automatically.</p>    <p>This problem might seem minor, but it’s not. It can keep your monitor awake for hours, waste energy, and shorten the display lifespan. Valve could easily fix this by refining its session logic to only inhibit screen sleep when necessary and always reset those settings when a session ends. That kind of polish is exactly what Linux users expect from a platform leader.</p>    <h2>
Scaling and DPI support are still a mess
</h2><h3>
Steam ignores or mishandles display scaling under Linux
</h3>
<div>
<div data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-2-1682193598" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-2-1682193598" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-2-1682193598" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-2-1682193598" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-2-1682193598-img" data-gallery-type="">
</div>
</div>
<p>Steam’s scaling behavior is one of the most obvious signs that it still doesn’t feel native on Linux. On high-resolution or multi-monitor setups, text and icons often appear too small or stretched. The client’s own “Scale text and icons to match monitor settings” option rarely works under Wayland, and in some cases, it does nothing at all. For users with fractional scaling enabled, Steam’s interface may appear uneven and difficult to read.</p>    <p>Some of the worst cases appear when Steam runs under XWayland. The window may render at a low internal resolution and then be upscaled by the compositor, resulting in everything appearing blurry. You can work around it by running Steam through Gamescope or adjusting compositor settings, but those solutions are far from convenient. They also shouldn’t be necessary in a modern desktop environment. Valve’s other projects, such as the Steam Deck, demonstrate that it knows how to handle scaling correctly.</p>    <p>Fixing this would bring a huge improvement in usability. The Steam client should read system-level scaling values and adapt in real time, just like native Linux apps do. With so many distributions now defaulting to Wayland and high-DPI displays becoming the standard, proper scaling is no longer optional. It’s a requirement for a clean and consistent experience.</p>    <h2>
The blank client window problem won’t die
</h2><h3>
Steam sometimes launches to a completely empty screen
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<img alt="A hand holding the Steam Deck." src="https://static0.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/04/steam-deck-linux-system-1.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=825&amp;dpr=2">
</div>
</div>
<p>Another issue that’s been plaguing users for years is the infamous blank Steam window. You launch the client, log in, and instead of seeing your library or store, you get an empty gray or black screen. It’s one of those bugs that seem random but show up frequently enough to be considered persistent. Sometimes restarting the client works, and other times the only way to fix it is by launching Big Picture mode.</p>    <p>This problem has been linked to several different causes. On Wayland, GPU handoff issues and compositor quirks can prevent Steam’s Chromium-based interface from drawing correctly. On dual-GPU systems, Steam sometimes opens using the wrong GPU and fails to render altogether. Even on X11 systems, the same blank window can appear after updates or runtime changes. The fact that it’s survived so many UI revisions suggests a deeper architectural flaw.</p>    <p>Users shouldn’t have to troubleshoot their game launcher just to play games. Valve needs to make Steam’s graphical initialization more reliable and resilient to differences between drivers and compositors. When the client fails to load its own interface, it undermines user confidence and makes Linux gaming feel unstable. This should be one of the first things Valve addresses.</p>    <h2>
Proton still needs consistency improvements

Compatibility issues keep some games from launching properly

It works impressively well most of the time, but when it doesn’t, the experience quickly becomes frustrating.

The inconsistency makes it difficult for users to know what to expect from one title to the next.</p>    <p>Many players end up experimenting with different Proton versions or tweaking launch options to find a working combination. Others have had to reinstall the Steam runtime entirely just to fix missing dependencies. These issues often stem from how Steam manages compatibility layers and runtime libraries.
